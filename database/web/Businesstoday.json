            "content": "Uzbekistan will allow companies to mine cryptocurrencies using solar energy and will exempt all crypto operations by domestic and foreign companies from income tax, according to a presidential decree published this week. The Tashkent government wants miners to power their farms by installing their own solar panels. Alternatively, mining companies can be connected to the power grid if they pay double the regular price. However, during peak consumption periods extra surcharges can be levied, according to the decree. No license is required for mining but the company must be registered by a newly formed Uzbek National Agency for Perspective Projects, the document said. Some cryptocurrencies, including bitcoin, are created by a process called proof of work which requires computers to \"mine\" the currency by solving complex puzzles. Powering those computers involves large amounts of electricity. Uzbekistan legalized cryptocurrency trading in 2018 but only on a domestic crypto exchange. The central Asian nation has also launched a series of renewable energy projects, mostly solar and wind power plants. Neighbouring Kazakhstan, which became the world's second-largest centre for bitcoin mining after the United States last year, has cracked down on mining after such operations strained its power grid dominated by ageing coal power plants.

            "content": "Amid allegations from crypto Twitter that Coinbase promotes insider trading during crypto token listings, the exchange has modified its listing rules.  The new approach  In a blog post last week, Coinbase CEO Brian Armstrong announced that the exchange has changed its listing rules to prevent seasoned traders from getting hints about upcoming listings from on-chain data.  Armstrong wrote in his blog, “Going forward, we plan to publish externally once a decision has been made to list an asset, but before any technical integration work begins, to try and prevent on-chain data giving signal to watchful traders. In addition, we plan to publish only once a decision has affirmatively been made to list, versus when we’ve decided to consider listing an asset.”  The issue  Last month, individuals on Twitter started accusing the cryptocurrency exchange of insider trading following the recent cryptocurrency listing.   Insider trading is the practice of profiting from non-public, confidential, material information related to an asset before it becomes public.  Coinbase had announced the listing of 50 new cryptocurrencies on its platform. The majority of these cryptocurrencies had a market capitalization of less than $1 billion and lacked liquidity.  In an interesting chain of events, a substantial amount of money was invested just hours before their listing became public news. After the announcement became public, the invested amount went up by 40 per cent. And this did not miss crypto Twitter’s eyes.  Twitter’s observations  Jordan Fish, a crypto influencer known on Twitter as Cobie, used on-chain data to point out that Coinbase was promoting insider trading.  Found an ETH address that bought hundreds of thousands of dollars of tokens exclusively featured in the Coinbase Asset Listing post about 24 hours before it was published, rofl pic.twitter.com/5QlVTjl0Jp Another user drew attention to large sums invested in another token just hours prior to its listing on Coinbase.  Someone made a fresh wallet and front ran 7 figures into $UPI and $AVT before the @Coinbase announcement of listings.\n\nMakes sense now.\nClear insider trading going on behind the Coinbase doors.$UPI Txns: https://t.co/qP9cyB9UAT\n\nActual Wallet: https://t.co/bi2AulZg7d Coinbase CSO responded to these allegations on Twitter saying Thanks, @cobie. My team has been investigating since yesterday. Investigations like this are not quick or simple but they are critical to determining the context surrounding those on-chain movements. Transparency is also key, so I will share any findings as soon as we are able.

            "content": "Bitcoin, the largest cryptocurrency by market cap is the first mainstream cryptocurrency. It was launched in the year 2009 by an anonymous developer Satoshi Nakamoto. Here is everything you need to need about Bitcoin.  What is Bitcoin?  Bitcoin is a cryptocurrency. Cryptocurrencies are an electronic form of money, whose record is stored on the blockchain, which is a digital ledger.  Who created Bitcoin?  In 2008, an anonymous developer, who went by Satoshi Nakamoto, released a whitepaper, Bitcoin: A Peer-to-Peer Electronic Cash System.   The paper described how any two willing parties could transact directly with each other without the need for a trusted third party, like a central bank or a government.  It also solved the double-spending problem with the help of blockchain.  Nakamoto's identity remains unknown.   Why was Bitcoin created?  Bitcoin’s genesis’ block's coinbase contains the following headline from The Times.  “Chancellor on brink of second bailout for banks\"  Many people interpret it as both a timestamp and a statement on the instability caused by fractional-reserve banking which was the main cause behind the 2008 financial crisis.  How does Bitcoin work?  Bitcoin is a peer-to-peer network. Users can exchange Bitcoin with others without the need of any middlemen to conduct and confirm the transactions via the network.   Users can join this network directly and gain access to the blockchain, which is the network's public ledger that contains a record of all prior Bitcoin transactions.  How many Bitcoins exist?  The entire quantity of Bitcoin is capped at 21 million coins, which means that once that number is reached, the protocol will cease minting new coins.   Furthermore, all the existing Bitcoin needs to be mined before 2140, or else the unmined Bitcoin post that point in time will be lost forever.  How do I buy Bitcoins?  Bitcoin can be bought on traditional centralized exchanges (CEX) like Binance, Coinbase, FTX, CoinDCX, WazirX, CoinSwitch Kuber and other exchanges. It can also be bought on Decentralised exchanges (DEX) like UniSwap or PancakeSwap.  Bitcoin can also be bought in a peer-to-peer (P2P) method for cash but there are high chances of fraud in this method.

            "content": "In a circular sent out of Friday, the Ministry of Electronics and Information Technology has made it compulsory for all virtual asset service providers to store KYC details and transaction records of their users for a period of five years.   Virtual asset service providers include cryptocurrency exchanges.  Experts welcomed this move and envision that this would help in clamping down of cybercrime. Sharat Chandra, crypto expert, and VP, Research and Strategy, EarthID, told Business Today,   “The recent financial transaction data storage directives, issued by the Ministry of Electronics and IT, to virtual digital asset service providers and custodian wallet providers augur well for investors and the crypto industry. The cybersecurity guidelines will ensure that citizens' data and fundamental rights are protected.”  Chandra also believes that this is a part of the government’s “measured approach” to crypto, as previously claimed by Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman. He said, “The government is gradually laying the groundwork for legislation as part of its publicly stated \"measured approach\" to crypto.”  But the industry has its reservations about this new compliance requirement. Anshul Dhir COO and co-founder of EasyFi Network, a Web3 project, thinks that the time period of five years is a very long period of time to store the records. He explained his reservations to Business Today by saying, “I think this request from the government of India is extraordinary when it comes to the preservation of data for long, five years. So, I believe they have to completely change their business models if they want to comply with the new rules.”  Similar concerns are shared by The Dialogue, a Think Tank discoursing on Data Privacy. Saikat Datta, Strategic Advisor of the Think Tank told Business Today, “The latest notification from CERT-IN is an important one, but could end up having a negative impact. Globally, we have learnt from experience that cybersecurity is a shared responsibility. This order form CERT-IN could divide the public and private sectors, with the public sectors being privileged, while the private sector’s concerns not being taken into account.”  Also Read: Warren Buffett dismisses Bitcoin, says would not buy all the supply in the world for $25 - BusinessToday Also Read: Goldman Sachs bullish on crypto  - BusinessToday ",

            "content": "The company behind the \"Bored Ape\" series of NFTs has raised around $285 million worth of cryptocurrency by selling tokens which represent land in a virtual world game it says it is building. Last year, US start-up Yuga Labs created the Bored Ape Yacht Club NFTs, blockchain-based tokens representing a set of 10,000 computer-generated cartoon apes. As non-fungible tokens (NFTs) - crypto assets that represent digital files such as images, video, or items in an online game - exploded in popularity, Bored Ape prices surged to fetch hundreds of thousands of dollars each. They became one of the most prominent NFT brands, with Apes sold at top auction houses and owned by celebrities including Paris Hilton and Madonna. Now, Yuga Labs - which raised $450 million in March in a funding round led by Andreessen Horowitz - has set its sights on the so-called \"metaverse\".  In an online sale on April 30, Yuga Labs sold NFTs called \"Otherdeeds\", which it said could be exchanged as plots of virtual land in a future Bored Ape-themed online environment called \"Otherside.\" The \"Otherdeeds\" could only be bought using the project's associated cryptocurrency, called ApeCoin, which launched in March. There were 55,000 Otherdeeds for sale, priced at 305 ApeCoin each, and the company wrote on Twitter that these had sold out. This means the sale raked in 16,775,000 ApeCoin, worth around $285 million as of Sunday, according to Reuters calculations based on the price of ApeCoin on cryptocurrency exchange Coinbase at 1210 GMT. It was not clear how the funds would be distributed, although the company said the ApeCoin would be \"locked up\" for one year. The sale indicates the continued high demand for speculative, high-risk crypto assets related to online virtual worlds. NFTs are largely unregulated, and reports of scams, fakes and market manipulation are common. While many are baffled by the idea of paying real money for land which does not physically exist, some virtual land NFTs have already fetched millions of dollars. The Otherside metaverse will be a multi-player gaming environment, according to its website, which says it is currently under development. Yuga Labs declined to say how many people were working on building Otherside or when it would be launched. Yuga Labs' Otherdeeds sale comes shortly after the Bored Ape Yacht Club official Instagram account was hacked and a phishing link posted, allowing scammers to steal victims' NFTs. ",

            "content": "Ace investors and Berkshire Hathaway CEO Warren Buffett and Vice Chairman Charlie Munger thrashed Bitcoin at the company's annual shareholder's meet on Saturday.  Buffet’s views  Buffet said, \"If you told me to own all the Bitcoin in the world and offered it to me at $25, I wouldn't take it.\"  Buffet clarified that he would do so because he sees no value creation in holding Bitcoin. He explained that owning assets like real estate; farmland etc would generate income in the form of rent, crops, etc. But holding Bitcoin would not generate any such value. And the holder would only be profitable when he sells his holding to someone else at a higher price.  Munger’s take  Charlie Munger, Buffet’s longtime partner and Vice Chairman of his company took an, even more, harsher approach while explaining his views on Bitcoin.  He said, “In my life, I try to avoid things that are stupid and evil and make me look bad and Bitcoin does all three.”  He again commended the Chinese on their tough stance on crypto. He said, “In the first place, it’s stupid because it’s still likely to go to zero. It’s evil because it undermines the Federal Reserve System…and third, it makes us look foolish compared to the Communist leader in China. He was smart enough to ban Bitcoin in China.”  Discontent with crypto  This is not the first time Buffet and Munger have criticised cryptocurrencies. Previously, Munger compared cryptocurrencies to ‘venereal diseases’ and that they are ‘beneath contempt.’  Buffet once called Bitcoin ‘rat poison’ and berated it for not creating and adding any real value to the society.  But are they hypocrites?  Berkshire Hathaway made a $1 billion investment in NuBank earlier this year. NuBank is Latin America's leading provider of digital financial services. While Nubank does not aggressively promote cryptocurrency trading, its platform called NuInvest enables clients to participate in a variety of crypto assets and Bitcoin exchange-traded funds (ETF).  Furthermore, the company is consistently disinvesting in traditional financial assets and institutions. Their recent SEC filing revealed that the company sold around $3 billion in Visa and Mastercard stock.

            "content": "India Art Fair, an annual event celebrating the best of South Asia's modern and contemporary art, can now be accessed from anywhere in the world, thanks to the developments in the Web3 and metaverse space. The thirteenth edition of the art festival has marked its presence not only on the NSIC grounds in New Delhi but also in the metaverse.  All you need to experience the thrill of the India Art Fair is an active internet connection. Having AR and VR gear is not a must, but it makes the experience more immersive and works on browsers like Oculus Quest only. Interested visitors can enter the art fair in the metaverse via the link provided below, after which they get to choose the display name for their avatar or digital persona, which would be visible to the other IAF participants in the metaverse.  https://metaverse.indiaartfair.in/  The next step is choosing one's avatar. Users are allowed to create a unique avatar or digital persona for themselves when they enter the India Art Fair in the metaverse. There are six different variables that participants get to vary to create their unique avatar.   Users get to vary their skin colour, hair, eye wear, facial features, shirt and pants.  After creating the unique avatar, users enter the art fair hosted in the metaverse, upon which they are greeted by a female voice in the background who explains who participants can navigate in the metaverse for the best experience.  There are eleven major hotspots that the users can explore in the metaverse version of the fair. They include several exhibits, a helpdesk, an auditorium, a studio and workspace, etc.  A 50-feet long mural, the Aravani Art Project, created by a trans artist collective depicts a vision for a binary free, and inclusive world.  Another hotspot features Engulf, an artwork created by Narayan Sinha, is also exhibited. The sculpture tries to portray the tangled nature of the past year.  Another prominent exhibit is Kochi Rewind, which includes multiple excerpts of video installments from the past four editions of the Kochi-Muziris Biennale.  Users can also explore the aerial view of the India Art Fair in the metaverse.  Two eateries are also featured in the metaverse version of the fair, but of course, users can not enjoy them in the virtual world.  Moreover, Tezos India, the India chapter of the Tezos blockchain network, is also featured in the metaverse. In a bid to inspire and increase the adoption of clean NFTs among artists, Tezos India has collaborated with BeFantastic, a tech-art platform to mark it's presence at the India Art Fair.  The India Art Fair was bought alive in the metaverse because of the collaboration between XR Central and the fair body. Though the metaverse version of the fair captures the essence of the real fair in general, navigating through the fair in the metaverse is a bit difficult because of the limitation of input commands.  It is interesting to note that the India Art Fair is also being simultaneously held on the NSIC grounds. The fair will take place from April 28 to May 1. This is the 13th edition of the fair and is being organised under the guidance of Jaya Asokan, the fair director.  ",

As per the information provided by the financial service provider, the company provided a borrower with a cash loan from its secure lending facility, with Bitcoin serving as the collateral in the agreement.  The bank started warming up to the idea of Bitcoin-backed loans for the first time in December of 2021. Goldman Sachs also plans on lending to its institutional clients against Bitcoin.  Goldman Sachs will work with third-party agents to enable borrowers to sell securities in the anticipation of eventual repurchase. The bank believes these three-party repo arrangements would enable clients to borrow money more efficiently.  This move towards warming up to cryptocurrencies has not been an isolated incident. According to a press release issued by the investment bank, Goldman Sachs started to offer Bitcoin-based financial solutions to its high-net-worth clientele, on April 1.  Moreover, in March 2022, Goldman Sachs began trading over the counter Bitcoin options. Additionally, they have also created a specialised digital assets team dedicated at giving them an edge in the Web3 sector.  Goldman Sachs also sees the potential in non-fungible tokens (NFTs). Recently they announced that they have plans of researching and expanding into NFTs because the bank sees great potential in the digital asset as financial products.  Other Wall Street financial giants are also expanding into the Web3 world. Recently, Morgan Stanley became the first bank to open a branch in the metaverse. The bank opened the ‘Onyx Lounge’ in the Decentraland metaverse.   Jefferies Financial Group Inc. also offers banking services to cryptocurrency users. BlackRock Inc. made a $400 million investment in the stablecoin startup Circle last in March. Cowen Inc., another investment bank also announced the establishment of a digital assets division in the month of March.  The trust of institutional banks in cryptocurrencies, NFTs and other digital assets would provide a push to widespread adoption and use of this asset class.  ",

            "content": "Cryptocurrencies have come to aid Ukraine again, which has been amid an intense war with Russia for over 2 months now. As per Finnish media reports, the country would be donating over €70 million worth of confiscated Bitcoin to the eastern European country. Moreover, the government has partnered with Coinmotion and Tesseract, two Finnish digital asset service providers, to act as brokers to put their plan in motion.  Coinmotion and Tesseract would sell off the cryptocurrency which was confiscated by the Finlan’s customs. The same amount in fiat would then be donated to the battle-scarred country. The authorities plan to donate approximately 1,890 Bitcoins via this process. Annika Saariko, Finland's Finance Minister, who also happens to be the Deputy Prime Minister of the country, verified this news on Facebook. It is interesting to note that this donation will take some significant time to materialise. As per the information provided by Saarikko, the proposal would be put forth in the European country's parliament in the upcoming fiscal year's budget. It is noteworthy to mention that donations in cryptocurrency to Ukraine have surpassed $100 million. Cryptocurrencies have been crucial in raising donations for Ukraine's resistance to the Russian invasion. The entire crypto community has come together to help Ukraine at this time of turmoil. NFTs, cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin, Ether, meme coin Doge, DOT, Terra, the stablecoin USDT Tether, etc, and even a Decentralised Autonomous Organization, the UkraineDAO have helped in raising funds for the country. The conflict between Russia and Ukraine has entered its 65th day.  Russia launched an attack on Ukraine in February 2022. The invasion took place via land, air, and sea, and many believe it to be the most large scale military invasion since World War II.  According to the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees and Human Rights, six people died during the Russian Federation's capture of Crimea, while hundreds of civilians and military personnel were killed during the fight in Donbas and the Russian invasion of Ukraine in 2022.

            "content": "Tech billionaire Elon Musk bought Twitter as announced on Monday and this development is consequential not just for 'free speech' but also for crypto. Because now, the world's biggest crypto influencer owns an influencing platform with the reach of a little less than 300 million people (bots too).   The tech mogul has always been a staunch advocate of cryptocurrencies and Web3. He often speaks about cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin, Ether and particularly fondly about the meme coin Doge.  Dogecoin  Elon Musk himself admits that Dogecoin is his favourite cryptocurrency, and his comments about the currency have often caused rallies and slumps in the price of the token. Recently, when Musk suggested that the popular meme coin should be integrated with Twitter's premium service, Twitter Blue, as a viable payment option, the token rallied over 9 per cent in light of his comment. The cryptocurrency also rose nearly 30 per cent after the news of his takeover of the microblogging site became public.  So yes, all this points at the fact that Musk's Twitter takeover is going to bring the meme coin to the mainstream. If they end up integrating Dogecoin with Twitter Blue, the token would definitely gain more acceptance as a payment option on other platforms as well.  Crypto scam bots  If you believe Musk, bots, especially crypto scam bots are the scourge of Twitter. And he has also publicly vowed to get rid of them or ‘die trying.  One consequence of his Twitter takeover could mean a crackdown on crypto scam bots on the microblogging site.  Web3 adoption  Elon Musk has always been a fervor advocate of Web3 technology and decentralization. Experts believe, with Twitter at his disposal, Musk would be able to bring decentralization to the mainstream and his plans to make the Twitter algorith code open-source, would increase the trust in the crypto arena.  Expert’s take  Sharat Chandra, crypto expert and Vice President, Research and Strategy at Web3 platform EarthID told Business Today, \" Though Musk has been a vocal advocate of crypto and decentralization, his tweets have the potential to move markets.”  Chandra believes that Musk’s influence can shape the narrative in the cryptoverse with Twitter. “With Twitter at his disposal, Musk's amplified social media reach can act as a double-edged sword in shaping the narrative in cryptoverse. As announced by Elon Musk, open-source Twitter algorithms would reinforce trust in the platform and fight the menace of spambots. But a lot would depend on how this would be implemented in a non-partisan manner.”  Also Read: Elon Musk buys Twitter for $44 billion Also Read: And it’s done. Elon Musk now owns Twitter. ",

            "content": "Crypto has opened up several avenues of money making for interested people but people lack clarity on how to use these tools to their benefit. Crypto bounties are one such medium.  What are crypto bounties?  In simple words, crypto bounties are prizes in cryptocurrency tokens that a Web3 project awards users after completing particular tasks successfully. These tasks may be different in each project and the reward amount may also be different.  What do participants need to do to earn rewards?  Most often, these programs demand participants to identify bugs in a blockhain network. One such crypto bounty program is run by Ethereum, the most widely used blockhain network. Participants in the Ethereum crypto bounty program are tasked to find bugs and vulnerability in the network, which has the most Web3 projects running on its blockchain. Successful participants are awarded Ether, which the native crypto token of the Ethereum blockchain. As per data from CoinMarketCap as of 11:00 am IST, Ether was up 1 per cent and was trading at $2,880 which amounts upto Rs 2,20,760.  The misuse of crypto bounties  In the year 2017-18, certain Web3 projects started using crypto bounty programs as a marketing scheme to gain popularity for their project. Many projects started launching crypto bounty programs simultaneously with their project launches or ICOs (Initial Coin Offerings¹). This led to a slew of a several bounty programs with tokenised rewards which did not have any fundamental value. The time and efforts of the bounty hunters participating in these programs started going down the drain due to lack of any value in the prize which was awarded post completion of the tasks successfully.  Where can you find legitimate projects  Despite the widespread misuse of crypto bounty programs by some projects in the past, they are still relevant in current times. Interested bounty hunters can find legitimate crypto bounty projects on the official website of Coinbase or Ethereum.  Tax on crypto bounties in India  Since the tax laws specifically applicable on cryptocurrencies in India have been recently introduced, there is no exact provision for taxes on gains via crypto bounties as of now. But, from what we can understand from the law which has been introduced, all crypto gains would be subject to 30 per cent tax and 1 per cent TDS. This should be applicable on gains from crypto bounties as well.  ",

            "content": "Regulatory uncertainty, a new crypto tax regime and Reserve Bank of India voicing strong reservations are just some of the headwinds troubling the crypto industry in India. And with the UPI kerfuffle added to the mix, cryptocurrency exchanges are going through a liquidity crunch, adding to their overall woes and creating a long shadow over the crypto ecosystem.  Also, this is not the only cause of concern for KYC compliant crypto exchanges in India. They are going through serious volume drops because of apprehension from retail investors about the asset class, with all the confusion and lack of clarity in this space. Data curated by CREBACO suggests that trading volumes at Indian exchanges like WazirX and ZebPay has taken a hit post April 1, when the new crypto tax laws were implemented.  On WazirX exchange, trading volumes dropped to 57.79 per cent as of April 27, from April 1. ZebPay witnessed a drop of 26.03 per cent in trading volumes as of April 27. And experts believe that this situation might not improve overnight.  Sidharth Sogani, founder and CEO of CREBACO Global, told Business Today: \"The overall enthusiasm and momentum of the crypto market in India has nearly died. The volumes are a clear indication of the sentiment. The way the volumes are going on at the moment, I don't see them revise until and unless there are better tax and compliant standards.”  He does not see the situation improving despite bullish trends in the markets in the past month. “We were expecting the volume to revive but in spite of the attractive crypto market the volume has not come back.”  Sharat Chandra, a crypto expert and vice president of research and strategy at EarthID, echoed similar views. He highlighted the regulatory squeeze which impacted payment gateways like MobiKwik and UPI for investing via KYC compliant crypto exchanges.  “The regulatory uncertainty and an informal squeeze on payment gateways and banking support for crypto have resulted in lower trading figures for exchanges,\" Chandra said. He also threw light on how other asset classes are becoming more attractive to customers. “Market uncertainty, too, has abetted the movement of funds out of riskier asset classes like crypto. Commodities like gold are attracting investor interest.”  It is interesting to note that tax rates applicable to the asset class mentioned by Chandra are relatively lower than that applicable to cryptocurrencies. Short-term gains on precious metals like gold are taxed based on tax brackets and long-term gains are taxed at 20% with indexation benefits whereas cryptocurrency gains, irrespective of tax brackets or investment time period, are taxed at a flat 30 per cent since April 1. A 1 per cent TDS would also be applicable on all crypto transfers from July 1. Despite these challenges, Chandra is optimistic about the growth of crypto in India. “These are challenging times, but builders in the crypto-ecosystem are putting their expertise into building new enabling tools for increasing the adoption of DAOs and Web3.0\".

            "content": "Brazil, the largest South American country, is the latest to regulate cryptocurrencies. The Brazillian senate has passed a bill to regulate cryptocurrencies in the country on Wednesday. The bill aims at creating a regulatory framework for the country’s crypto industry. As per the system proposed by the senate in the bill,  crypto legislation would be the responsibility of the executive branch of the government. Moreover, the executive branch would have the option of creating a new regulator for cryptocurrencies or delegating jurisdiction to the Securities and Exchange Commission (CVM) or the Brazilian Central Bank (BC). Moreover, the proposed laws also aims to attract crypto businesses to the country. The law makers plan on exempting Bitcoin miners from all import charges on ASIC mining machines to entice them to set up shop in Brazil. Brazil is also aiming at getting into the CBDC game, like many other countries across the world. It is noteworthy to mention that as per information from Brazil's central bank the CBDC trial would begin in 2022. The bill also delves into what the punishment would mean when it comes to crimes related to cryptocurrencies. Several senators, including the bill's author, Senator Arns, focused the discussion on appropriate sanctions for crypto crimes, particularly fraud. Senator Arns believes that the punishment should be proportional to the amount of fraud, money laundering, and other white-collar crime committed. Interestingly, this is not the first time the cryptocurrency bill was debated on the senate floor in Brazil. In 2015, federal deputy Aureo Ribeiro had introduced the cryptocurrency regulation legislation for the first time. The bill must first be passed by the Chamber of Deputies before President Jair Bolsonaro signs it into law. By the end of 2022, this is expected to happen. ",

Elon Musk is considered by many as the biggest crypto influencer.

It has surpassed tokens like AVAX, DOT, etc to become the tenth most valuable cryptocurrency token overnight. Dogecoin's fortunes changed after tech billionaire Elon Musk took over Twitter last night. The Dogefather, a name given to Elon Musk due to his fondness of the token, bought the microblogging site for an astronomical $44 billion. Elon Musk had previously suggested to incorporate Dogecoin into Twitter blue as a viable payment option. It would be interesting to see what Elon does with Twitter and what it would mean for Doge. ",

Elon Musk has bought Twitter for $44 billion. The deal comes almost a month after the mercurial billionaire entrepreneur disclosed publicly his almost 9 per cent stake in the microblogging site, making him the single largest individual shareholder of Twitter. Following this, Musk was invited by Twitter to join the company's board, which the former declined. Days after this he disclosed his bid to buy Twitter, as per a filing with the US markets regulator Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC).  Earlier on Monday it was reported that Musk had managed to put together a $46.5 billion funding package to acquire Twitter.  Twitter announced late on Monday that it has entered into a “definitive agreement to be acquired by an entity wholly owned by Elon Musk, for $54.20 per share in cash in a transaction valued at approximately $44 billion”. Once this transaction is complete Twitter will become a “privately held company”. This is not the first time Elon Musk related news has caused a rally in the popular cryptocurrency.  The token has many times witnessed rallys because of Musk's comments. Recently, Elon Musk had suggested several ways in which the microblogging site Twitter could be improved. He also suggested that Dogecoin should be a viable payment option on the social networking site. It would be interesting to see how Elon Musk incorporates Dogecoin in the Twitter ecosystem.

            "content": "The 13th edition of the Indian Art Fair, which starts on April 28, will not just be hosted on the NSIC grounds, but will also be hosted in the metaverse. The Indian Art Fair announced in a release that it has partnered with XR Central to produce a digital twin of this year’s fair for a browser-based 3D metaverse experience. The fair will go on till May 1, 2022. As per the information in the release, the visitors to the fair will be able to select and customise full-body avatars for their virtual visit. The release also clarifies that the XR Central team has worked to deliver several choices of headgear, skin colour, and body type to create an inclusive and diverse metaverse experience. Furthermore, visitors will be able to toggle between first-person and third-person point-of-views and interact with friends and family at the metaverse version of the India Art Fair 2022 giving them an immersive experience. It is interesting to note that the metaverse space would not have a fee and would be accessible via a variety of devices and browsers. Jaya Asokan, Fair Director of India Art Fair, said, “Art and technology have long shared a connection and we are exploring this intersection at a dedicated new space called The Studio with digital and AR projects led by artists, artists collectives, and leading institutions. As we proceed further into the digital age, we are proud to work with XR Central to create the India Art Fair metaverse to add another dimension to the fair, opening it up to visitors all over the world.” The Indian Art Fair takes place annually in India’s capital, New Delhi. The fair reflects the city’s local arts scene and also offers curated insights into the cultural landscapes of neighbouring countries. Shrey Mishra, co-founder of XR Central said, “We are extremely excited to partner with IAF to create its first-ever Metaverse edition of the fair. With a Total Addressable Global Market pegged at USD 552.57 Billion, art is at the cusp of being disrupted with immersive technologies like XR (AR, VR and MR). At XR Central, we are really proud of having created such a powerful platform, MetaQube, that is democratizing the way metaverses are being looked at.” ",

The company has also announced that the metaverse would be powered by ApeCoin, which is the native token of the BAYC ecosystem, which was launched last month and listed on exchanges like Binance, Coinbase, FTX, Huobi, OKX, and Kraken. Moreover, Coinbase had also announced recently that the NFT collection will be featured in a movie trilogy called The Degen Trilogy, which will premiere in June. This is not the first time the characters of the Bored Ape Yacht Club are going mainstream. Previously, it was announced that Universal Music Group,  a Dutch–American multinational music corporation,  is forming a band around the apes from the popular NFT collectible called the Kingship.  Also on April 9, a BAYC-themed restaurant in California opened, accepting ApeCoin, the BAYC ecosystem's native token, as a form of payment. Since its debut in April last year, the Bored Ape Yacht Club has become one of the most sought-after NFT collections. Yuga Labs, the creators of the famous NFT series acquired other popular collectibles CryptoPunks and Meebits last month expanding their collection. It is also noteworthy to mention that Bored Ape Yacht Club is one of the most expensive NFT collectibles, selling for between $200,000 and $3 million. This collection comprises still images of apes and is based on the Ethereum blockchain. Mark Cuban, Eminem, Snoop Dogg, Justin Bieber, Post Malone, Jimmy Fallon, and Steph Curry are among the celebrities who hold BAYC NFTs. ",

After El Salvador, Lugano and Honduras Prospera, a special economic zone in the Latin American country, the Central African Republic has also passed a law to accept Bitcoin as legal tender, as reported by Forbes.  As per the report, the National Assembly unanimously passed the bill which would make the cryptocurrency legal tender in the country.  Calixte Nganongo, minister of finance and budget, and Gourna Zacko, minister of digital economy, postal services, and telecommunications, initiated and introduced the legislation establishing the legal framework for cryptocurrency regulation in the Central African Republic, as well as Bitcoin as an official currency.  The law was unanimously supported by the National Assembly to assist the country's economic recovery and peacebuilding efforts. Bitcoin was accepted as legal tender last in September by El Salvador. Nayib Bukele, the President of El Salvador has always been bullish about the prospects of cryptocurrencies and actively speaks about them.  Moreover, the city of Lugano in Switzerland also accepted Bitcoin along with stablecoin USDT Tether and LVGA as de facto legal tender in the city last month.  Apart from that, even Honduras Prospera, a special economic zone in the Latin American country Honduras announced this month that they would be accepting Bitcoin as legal tender in the country to propel economic growth.  Despite this, experts still believe Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies are too volatile to function as legal tender in modern economies. It is still interesting to note that institutional investors like Morgan Stanely, Goldman Sachs, etc have recently shown interest in Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies propelling widespread adoption.   Also, recently retail giants like Walmart, Shopify, Whole Foods, McDonald's, Starbucks too have started accepting Bitcoin as a viable payment option via the Lightning Network.  Despite volatility, Bitcoin as it seems will have a significant role in shaping the future of money.  ",

According to the Dogecoin Foundation's core development team, the cryptocurrency Dogecoin was successfully delivered 100 miles from its origin through radio transmission using the RadioDoge protocol, Libdogecoin and the Starlink satellite network.   RadioDoge is a protocol created by the Dogecoin Foundation that aims at providing access to Dogecoin via low-cost radio technology with the help of Starlink satellites and Libdogecoin is a library of C language based Dogecoin protocols that are used to build Dogecoin projects.  Michi Lumin, a developer at Dogecoin Foundation took to Twitter to announce this breakthrough.  According to the tweet, the developer delivered 4.2069 DOGE with the help of RadioDoge, Libdogecoin, and the Starlink mainnet.  Starlink is a SpaceX-operated satellite broadband constellation. And SpaceX is founded by none other than the Dogefather Elon Musk himself. Elon Musk has previously vocally supported the meme token often causing rallies in the price of the cryptocurrency.  It is interesting to note that Bitcoin was the first crypto token that could be sent across without an active internet connection. Previously, Bitcoin transactions have taken place without an active internet connection via mesh networking, amateur radio equipment, and portable antennas. Dogecoin was trading down 4.07% at $0.1288 as of 10.50 am IST on Monday as per CoinMarketCap data.  ",

            "content": "Crypto mining is the process by which new cryptocurrencies are bought into circulation and new transactions are verified by the blockchain, which is a digital ledger.   The Problem  In order to mine effectively, specialised computer hardware is required, which uses a large amount of electricity to function properly. Additionally, mining farms, which are large-scale mining operations, operate in a variety of places throughout the world, taking use of the quickest internet connections and cheapest energy sources.  The construction of cryptocurrencies is also a concern, as the majority of Proof of Work coins use an algorithm that makes hashes more complex to solve with time, raising electricity consumption and accompanying costs.  Concerns being raised across the world  This process requires a lot of energy and has been a cause of concern for environmentalists. Recently, US House Democrats including Jamaal Bowman of California; Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez of New York; and Jesús G. \"Chuy\" García and Marie Newman of Illinois have called crypto mining an “Environmental Threat.”  The European Union had attracted great attention with its recent talks on a possible ban on proof-of-work (PoW) mining. Environmental pollution caused by huge energy consumption was one of their major arguments to place the ban.    The move towards a greener future  But latest trends show that crypto mining is going green by the day. Ethereum, the decentralised, open-source blockchain with the first ever smart contract functionality, has started moving towards Proof of Stake protocols from Proof of Work protocols and this step is promising because the energy consumption on the blockchain would drastically drop.  Furthermore, as per research released in January by the Bitcoin Mining Council, the worldwide Bitcoin mining sector is being powered by an estimated 58.5 per cent renewable energy by the fourth quarter of 2021.    Norway leads the way  Moreover, a recent report by the Norwegian government highlights how it is setting an example when it comes to green Bitcoin mining.   Because Norway has access to hydropower and other renewable energy sources, Bitcoin miners in the country are more environmentally friendly than practically everywhere else on the earth. In fact, renewable energy sources account for 100 per cent of Norway's electricity generation capacity.  Of Norway's annual electricity production of 157 Terrawatt hours (TWh), 88 percent is generated by hydroelectric power, with the remaining 20 percent coming from wind and thermal energy.  China is also considering greener Bitcoin mining as a possible trillion-dollar industry.   Does all this indicate Bitcoin mining is getting greener by the day? We will keep watch.  ",

After the launch, every crypto transaction made on the platform will support verified carbon offset projects.  The process of mining cryptocurrency uses a significant amount of energy which contributes to global carbon emissions.  To reduce its carbon footprint, Pledge commissioned an environmental consulting firm, Three Squares Inc, to conduct a cryptocurrency environmental impact assessment to quantify the carbon emissions of cryptocurrency transactions made on the platform, the company said in a statement. The platform also announced in the release that eight of the most used cryptocurrencies were evaluated in-depth to quantify the emissions associated with a single transaction. This in-depth analysis factored in the total estimated energy of the cryptocurrency, matched with published recent transaction volumes.  Furthermore, a weighted electricity emissions factor was derived based on the regional breakdown of transaction locations around the globe. Multiple data sets were also used to ensure optimal data integrity.  Data from the study concluded that while the final emissions vary based on the energy used, location, and the currency being donated, roughly every 100 donations generate approximately 2.6 tons of carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions. To compensate for this environmental impact, the donation platform announced that they will cover 100 per cent of the carbon footprint of each donation transaction at no additional cost to donors or nonprofits using PledgeCrypto. \"At Pledge, we fundamentally believe that unlocking crypto donations will provide an abundant new source of funding for nonprofits around the globe, but the process needs to be done in a sustainable way,” said James Citron, CEO of Pledge, in a statement. He further added, “We wanted to respond to environmental concerns about crypto. (the new) patent-pending invention (will) ensure that every crypto transaction through Pledge will support UNverified projects. This ensures that PledgeCrypto will not only be the most accessible way for donors to donate their digital assets and for nonprofits to receive them, but also in the most environmentally conscious way in the industry.” ",

Gas fee is the major cost driver when it comes to minting NFTs. It is the transaction fees users have to pay on the blockchain. Zero Knowledge Proofing on the Layer 2 blockchain is a privacy-focused Ethereum scaling method which would be employed to reduce the gas fee to zero on GuardianLink. It is noteworthy to mention that Layer 2 enhances transaction speed and enables effective scaling up for high frequency trading and NFT Gaming.  While the NFTs are minted on Layer 2 blockchain protocol with high throughput and zero gas fees, they are still secured by Ethereum just as they would be on the Layer 1 protocol.  The organisation said in a statement that this technology would be a first for the Asian market and will revolutionise NFT minting. Based on this tech, GuardianLink will be debuting its exclusive cricket NFTs and digital cricket collectibles via Jump.trade. Jump.trade is a gaming NFT marketplace recently introduced by GuardianLink.  GuardianLink has leveraged StarkWare’s technology as the underlying base to build its Layer 2 protocol. This enables interoperable blockchain protocol with all major networks including Ripple, Solana, Polygon and Avalanche, among others. Arjun Reddy, co- founder and CTO of GuardianLink said, “Our R&D team has been diligently working on providing technological supremacy for our NFT community, as well zero gas fees Layer 2 and interoperability with top blockchains. This Military Grade Secure product will empower the users to mint on Jump.trade with zero gas fees and support any number of trades throughout its lifetime, thereby encouraging greater participation for markets like India.” StarkWare is a Tel Aviv based blockchain company founded by the creator of ZK-STARKs, a private zero-knowledge proof system.

            "content": "Nischal Shetty and Siddharth Menon, the founders of Indian cryptocurrency exchange WazirX recently shifted base to Dubai after which has set off speculations about other crypto and Web3 startups and their management moving to Dubai.  Turns out, a few crypto exchanges from India have plans to capitalise on the facilitative ecosystem provided by pro-crypto governments across the world like that of Dubai, which is contrary to the business-ambience back home.  The primary grouse among the crypto-players obviously is India’s negative stance on cryptocurrencies. There is a lack of regulatory clarity on the subject. Moreover, the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) has also opted for a hostile approach when it comes to the matter of cryptocurrencies. To top it, the recent tax regime, which introduced a flat 30 per cent tax on all crypto gains is doing no favor to investors or crypto service providers.  Amid this mayhem, Dubai seems to offer a ray of hope for crypto service providers. With laws facilitating crypto businesses, ‘Work from Dubai’ has become a popular trend in the crypto industry.  Why Dubai  As Business Today recently reported, Dubai is preparing to become the world's crypto capital. As regional economic competition intensifies, the emirate has pushed for the growth of the crypto sector by establishing a regulatory environment conducive to the recruitment of crypto enterprises and personnel.  Sheikh Mohammed Bin Rashid, the ruler of Dubai, announced last month that the emirate had passed its first law governing virtual assets and that the crypto ecosystem will be overseen by an independent regulator.  The Dubai Virtual Asset Regulation Law (VARA) was enacted with the goal of promoting Dubai and the UAE as regional and global cryptocurrency trading hubs.  Moreover, VARA would be in charge of the regulatory, licensing, and governance aspects of the virtual asset business environment. Indian exchanges obviously want to capitalise on this opportunity.   Avinash Shekhar, CEO of  ZebPay told Business Today when asked if the exchange would apply for a license in Dubai, following global exchanges like Binance, FTX, etc, the CEO said “ZebPay has always been an Indian organisation with a global outlook. Our platform currently supports multiple countries and we will continue to explore licensing opportunities globally.”  Despite global ambitions, the exchange still has plans to keep its base here in India. “India is, and will continue to be, ZebPay's primary market. We don't intend to shift our base of operations to Dubai in the foreseeable future.”  Sathvik Vishwanath, founder of Unocoin also had similar thoughts. He told Business Today that currently, they have no plans of shifting base to the Emirate. He said “No we plan to stay and work out from India. We neither have plans of registering our exchange in Dubai in the short term.”   When Business Today reached out to CoinDCX, they responded by saying “Staying in India, building for India, and making India a leader in Web 3 is our mission.”  ",

Binance told users that Russian nationals and people living in the country, as well as companies based there, that hold crypto worth over 10,000 euros ($10,900), would be banned from making new deposits or trading. Affected clients would however be able to withdraw funds, it said. Accounts for Russia-linked users that have completed address checks and hold crypto worth less than 10,000 euros would remain active, Binance added. In its fifth package of sanctions on Russia, the EU this month targeted digital wallets used to store, send, receive and spend cryptocurrencies, part of broader efforts to close potential loopholes that could allow Russians to move money abroad. Binance, along with major U.S. exchanges Coinbase Global Inc and Kraken, had rejected calls from Kyiv for a total ban on Russian users after President Vladimir Putin ordered the invasion of Ukraine, which Moscow calls a \"special operation\" to demilitarise and \"denazify\" the country. Binance said in March it would not \"unilaterally freeze millions of innocent users' accounts\", but that it would ensure compliance with sanctions. It also said last month that cardholders of Russian banks subject to sanctions would not be able to use the cards on their platform and confirmed that individuals in the same category had had their access restricted.

            "content": " Australia became the newest country to launch a Bitcoin ETF after the regulators finalised their approvals. This move has brought back Bitcoin ETFs into the limelight because many consider them to be low-risk alternatives to cryptocurrencies.  Bitcoin ETF is an exchange-traded fund that tracks the price of the most popular cryptocurrency and allows investors to purchase and sell the security on a stock exchange throughout the day.  They allow investors to gain exposure to Bitcoin through traditional stock markets instead of having to buy or sell the digital asset on a cryptocurrency exchange.  Moreover, ETFs are regulated financial vehicles, that is they are approved by regulatory authorities, which gives investors a sense of security before investing in them.  Furthermore, unlike crypto markets, stock markets are far more liquid, which makes buying a Bitcoin ETF more preferable option than investing in the cryptocurrency itself.  However, investing in a Bitcoin ETF rather than directly owning it directly has a number of drawbacks as well.  The Australian regulator also plans on approving another crypto ETF next month.  US SEC had also given its nod to a Bitcoin ETF a few months ago. But the road to regulatory approval is not so easy. Incidentally, ace inventors Cathie Woods and the Winklekovs brothers’ request to launch Bitcoin ETFs was rejected by the US SEC.  The biggest issue is the fact that ETFs can only be bought and sold during market hours, but cryptocurrency exchanges are open 24 hours a day. This means that if the price of Bitcoin decreases dramatically, investors would not have an option to sell their holdings.  Also, while owning the cryptocurrency Bitcoin is free, ETFs charge an administrative fee. And, investors must go through know-your-customer (KYC) checks to buy ETFs, which is not the case when people invest in Bitcoin.  It can be anonymously bought on peer-to-peer exchanges as well.  Lastly, investors themselves have custody of their assets while investing in cryptocurrency. But the custodians are third parties when it comes to Bitcoin ETFs.  ",

The platform announced that the funds would be used to finish the development cycle of a game as well as to install and maintain game servers worldwide to provide a latency-free gaming experience. The multiplayer game platform also announced the launch of its in-game currency, the MOKA token on the Polygon network, which will serve as the main utility token in the ecosystem of company-developed eSports games and in the future for third party games that get integrated into the Mokens League Platform.  The platform further clarified that MOKA tokens will have a total supply of 500 million, and most of this supply will be held for distribution throughout Mokens League games. The rest of the supply will be spread across partners, marketing, liquidity management, and early investors. “While we are thrilled and excited about the massive growth of crypto-based gaming, we can’t help but notice that there is a fundamental problem right now with existing ‘play to earn’ games that reward people for just spending time on a game that does not work. This is not fun or challenging and definitely not sustainable,” said Martin Repetto, CEO of Monsters League Studios LLC.  The platform also announced in the release that MOKA holders can use their tokens, now available for presale, to purchase NFTs that can be used for games in Moken’s ecosystem. ",

Porsche Towson showroom sells a variety of Porsche vehicles - both new and pre-owned cars - in a wide range of configurations. On the other hand, BitPay, founded by Tony Gallippi and Stephen Pair in 2011 to make businesses payments easier with Bitcoin, has over 10,000 merchants that use its services for crypto transactions. The company also claims to be “the largest bitcoin payment processor in the world, serving businesses on 6 continents.” Interestingly, this isn’t the first time an independent car dealership has opted to use cryptocurrency as a means of payment. Last year, Bots Inc, a Puerto Rican-tech firm, had also enabled local dealerships to accept DOGE for pre-owned Tesla Inc. Last year, Tesla had stated that it would start accepting payments in bitcoin for its products, calming that it would first major automaker to do so. However, due to the environmental concerns around mining digital coins, the company had stepped back on its decision. Currently, Tesla doesn’t directly accept any cryptocurrency for vehicle purchases but is still accepting Dogecoin as payment for merchandise on its website. ",

            "content": "WazirX co-founders Nischal Shetty and Siddharth Menon have moved base to Dubai as reported by Business Today on Tuesday, and this move has shed light on the issue of ‘Crypto Brain Drain’ in India triggered by the introduction of the recent crypto tax regime by the Indian government.  As previously reported by Business Today, Dubai is gearing up to become the crypto capital of the world. The emirate has been fostering the expansion of the crypto sector by building a regulatory framework to attract crypto firms and expertise as regional economic competition heats up.  And as it turns out Indian founders of Web3 and crypto startups are capitalising on this. Pratik Gauri, founder and CEO of 5ire blockchain, which is headquartered in Dubai, told Business Today earlier this month, “The laws in Dubai are very kind to crypto and Web3 startups.  The VARA and Virtual Digital Asset Law helps in facilitating crypto businesses and that is one of the many reasons we chose Dubai.”  Last month, Sheikh Mohammed Bin Rashid, Dubai's ruler, stated that the emirate had approved its first law regulating virtual assets and had also established an independent regulator to oversee the cryptocurrency ecosystem.  The Dubai Virtual Asset Regulation Law was passed to establish Dubai and the United Arab Emirates as regional and worldwide hubs for cryptocurrency traders.  The Dubai Virtual Assets Regulatory Authority (VARA), a regulatory body, would oversee the virtual asset business environment regulatory, licensing, and governance components.  Reggie Raghav Jerath, founder and CEO of Gather Network, a Web3 startup based out of Dubai, told Business Today, “Dubai is becoming an important hub for the cryptocurrency industry as it allows easier operability for asset licenses, many big players like Binance and FTX are opening their offices here. Heading towards becoming the crypto capital of the world, the region has been gaining heightened popularity. It is also treated as a hub for promoting various virtual assets NFTs and Web3, bringing crypto-friendly regulations in place to make sure the industry thrives.”  Well, as of now it seems like Dubai has become the most preferred location for Indian Web3 and crypto startups and in the process, India is losing out on talent as well as value created.

            "content": "Regulating crypto assets along with digital currency, addressing the remaining regulatory concerns in the banking sector and integrating with the global economy are among the few mid-term structural issues for India, a top official from the International Monetary Fund has said. Overall, the IMF is looking at India in a very positive fashion, Tobias Adrian, Financial Counselor and Director of the Monetary and Capital Markets Department told PTI on Tuesday. \"I think there are many opportunities and growth (in India is coming back). There's a recovery. There's a lot of excitement around new growth opportunities, new developments, he said on the sidelines of the annual spring meeting of the IMF and the World Bank. \"We always value that growth is inclusive, and is touching all of the people. But our general outlook in India is a fairly positive one, he said. Adrian said that regulating crypto assets is certainly high on the agenda for India when it comes to mid-term structural issues that the country needs to address in the coming years. \"That is something that is done globally. Within the financial stability board, we are trying to come up with global standards for crypto asset regulations. I think that's important for India to also adopt. Of course, I know that India has changed the taxation of crypto assets and that's a welcome move, he said. \"Secondly, India is exploring central bank digital currencies. That could be quite important for financial inclusion and financial development, and we are watching very closely what India is doing. We welcome those policy developments as well, the IMF official said. Noting that financial markets and financial institutions are key to growth and economic development, Adrian said addressing the remaining regulatory concerns in the banking system and in the non-bank system is also very important. \"Finally, I would argue that being part of the global financial system and being part of global trade is very beneficial to India. India can export many products, it can import products, it can raise capital externally, it can fund projects externally as well, there are Indian investments all over the world, he said. \"In our assessment, this integration, globally, of economic and financial ties is very beneficial and has lifted hundreds of millions of people out of poverty in recent decades. So, we welcome it very much and we think it's important for India to continue down the path, he said. Earlier during a news conference here, Adrian told reporters that In India they have seen an increase in sovereign debt as the government has deployed expansionary fiscal policies during the pandemic. \"We also saw an increase of holdings of banks of this sovereign debt. However, the fiscal situation in India is sustainable. Furthermore, the level of sovereign debt on the banks that we are seeing is also leaving us at comfort, so we are not alarmed at this point, he said. \"Having said that, there are many other countries where we do worry about this interaction between sovereign risk and banking sector exposures, but India is not one of them, Adrian said. Ranjit Singh, Assistant Director of the Monetary and Capital Markets Department, said that the situation with respect to India is certainly one that is manageable. The level of bank holdings of sovereign debt in India is actually at about 29 per cent, and this is on average higher than the emerging market figure of 16 per cent. And India's public debt-to-GDP ratio is at about 87 per cent, he said. ",

In an exclusive interaction with Business Today on the occasion of the exchange's Series D funding round after which the company's valuation zoomed to $2.15 billion, Khandelwal shed light on CoinDCX's future plans and what it takes to build the most valuable crypto company in India. Earlier today, the company announced that they have closed an oversubscribed round of Series D funding raising over $135 million, making them the most valuable crypto company in India. When asked what the exchange plans on doing with the latest influx of $135 million, the co founder said education, innovation, and compliance are the top priorities of the exchange. “Educating investors to invest in crypto and educating professionals to build for Web3 is what we are looking forward to,” he said. He also said that to promote innovation, CoinDCX needs to expand their team. “By the end of the year, we plan on expanding our team. Currently, we have 400 professionals working with us. And by the end of the year, we plan on expanding our team to a thousand engineers.” Khandelwal also said that persistence has been key to building the biggest crypto company in India. “When we started CoinDCX four years ago, there were over 100 companies working in the same space. But then the lack of regulatory clarity and RBI’s policies led many to shut their shops. But we remained persistent because we were always in for the long term,” he pointed out. The Series D round of funding was led by Pantera Capital and Steadview Capital. Moreover, existing investors such as B Capital Group, Coinbase, Polychain, and Cadenza increased their investments in the cryptocurrency exchange. Interestingly, Coinbase, a cryptocurrency exchange based out in the US, announced full-scale operations in India earlier this month. When asked what strategy would CoinDCX employ with Coinbase, the co founder said:  “Collaboration not competition among crypto exchanges, not just Coinbase, in India is the key to promoting crypto and Web3 in the country because the sector is very nascent at this point in time.” Also Read: Maharashtra's Gadchiroli to issue caste certificates via blockchain platform Polygon Also Read: Crypto crime: Pune police recovers over Rs 84 cr worth of Bitcoins ",

            "content": "A fledgling class of crypto that feasts on risk is outshining a wider market paralyzed by war and inflation. Coins backed by gold are newer variants of \"stablecoins\", which are typically pegged to the dollar to tame volatility. The largest, Pax Gold or PAXG , has jumped 7.4% in 2022, while main rival Tether Gold has leapt 8.5%. By contrast, bitcoin has lost over 13% and ether is down 20%. \"One of the main concerns that a lot of people who are new to crypto have is that it's not backed by anything. It just gets on a screen,\" said Everett Millman, chief market analyst at Gainesville Coins. \"So attaching them or linking them to a real-world commodity, it does make some sense.\" The reach for gold, a traditional hedge against geopolitical upheaval and inflation, is unsurprising. The demand for gold-backed cryptocurrencies, though, is new. Stablecoins, a fast-growing breed of crypto, have emerged as a common medium of exchange, often used by traders seeking to move funds around. It is easier to swap major stablecoins for bitcoin or other crypto, for example, than it is to swap traditional money like U.S. dollars for bitcoin. Tether Gold has been buoyed by bigger investors, including \"whales\" with $1 million or more of cryptocurrency, using the token to change a portion of their holdings into gold, according to Paolo Ardoino, Tether's chief technology officer. \"Many of our investors were already involved in crypto, but were interested in not having their entire wealth in cryptos or in dollars, and were seeking more inflation-resistant assets like gold,\" he said. Yet gold-backed coins are still a niche novelty in the crypto market at present - PAXG and Tether Gold are barely over two years old - with thin liquidity and little certainty about their long-term fortunes. PAXG has seen its market value almost double to $627 million this year, while Tether Gold has risen 9% to above $209 million. By comparison the latter's eight-year-old sibling, dollar-pegged Tether - the world's largest stablecoin - has a market cap of over $83 billion. According to data from CoinMarketCap, daily PAX gold trading volumes ranged between $10 million to $520 million over the past month, compared to ether volumes which fluctuated between $8.7 billion and $25 billion in April. Dollar-pegged tether's 24-hour volumes ranged between $35 billion and $92 billion. ALL THAT GLITTERS? Sceptics argue that PAXG, developed by the company Paxos, and Tether Gold have merely risen on the coat-tails of a broad rush for gold; indeed they have tracked the price of physical gold , which is up about 8.5% this year. PAXG is up 4.5% since Feb. 23, the day before Russia invaded Ukraine, versus gold's 4%. The SPDR Gold Shares exchange-traded fund , which is managed by State Street Global Advisors, is up 7.6% in 2022. \"The (crypto gold) tokens themselves aren't immutable. They're literally just IOUs that happen to be using blockchain infrastructure,\" said Alex Thorn, head of firmwide research for Galaxy Digital in New York. He said investors would have to determine whether they should have the same level of confidence in the companies behind PAXG and the gold ETF. \"They're both basically synthetic gold exposure backed by gold holdings. Perhaps trust is part of the thing that people would consider when deciding whether we can trust Paxos the same way we trust State Street.\" Nonetheless, advocates of such coins say they offer the ease of owning gold without having to worry about storing a physical coin or bar, while eliminating the minimum margin requirements often required to trade gold on traditional markets. PAXG, for instance, requires a minimum investment of the equivalent of 0.01 ounce of gold, roughly $20, versus the $184 an investor would pay for each share of the SPDR Gold ETF. Millman at Gainesville Coins also argued that gold-backed stablecoins bolstered the credibility of cryptocurrencies. \"One of the main criticisms of cryptos is that they have been so extremely volatile. Hence, the idea to back a token with a stable commodity,\" he said. \"The marriage between those two things could actually also bolster confidence in cryptos.\" Also Read: Paytm shares zoom 4% as Citi starts coverage with 'Buy' rating; good time to invest?

            "content": "Nischal Shetty and Siddharth Menon, co-founders of Indian cryptocurrency exchange WazirX, have shifted their base to Dubai from India, multiple sources with the knowledge of the matter told Business Today. Sources said that Shetty and Menon have moved out of India with their families to Dubai although WazirX still has an office in Mumbai and Bengaluru. Sameer Mhatre, a co-founder and the Chief Technology Officer at WazirX, however, continues to operate from India, one of the sources said. Currently, the entire workforce at WazirX is working remotely.  A WazirX spokesperson responded to our query by saying in a statement that the exchange is a remote-first organisation with employees in over 70 locations.  \"We are a remote-first organisation with employees from over 70+ locations. This gives all the company employees the option to work from anywhere, subject to their comfort and convenience unless they are required to travel officially. WazirX is headquartered in Mumbai and Bengaluru, and there is no change in any of our operating procedures. It is business as usual,\" the statement said. Meanwhile, BT awaits a comment from Shetty and Menon. The story will be updated as and when they respond. The development comes amidst the Indian government imposing a 30 per cent tax on virtual digital assets in addition to a 1 per cent tax deductible at source, a move which has led to a significant drop in trading volumes in crypto exchanges. The government has clarified that no losses will be set off against profits on VDAs and crypto mining will also be liable to taxes, which has drawn severe criticism from the industry players. Shetty has been vocal on social media platforms, including Twitter, hitting out at the Indian government's stance on crypto taxation saying that the move will impact the homegrown players and lead to a wealth drain from the country. India's Enforcement Directorate had issued a show cause notice to Shetty in June last year for allegedly violating provisions of the Foreign Exchange Management Act, for cryptocurrency deals worth Rs 2,790.74 crore. Shetty had earlier said in a statement that the crypto platform is in compliance with all applicable laws. \"We go beyond our legal obligations by following Know Your Customer (KYC) and Anti Money Laundering (AML) processes and have always provided information to law enforcement authorities whenever required,\" Shetty had said and reported earlier by BT. Shetty had also announced his project Shardeum with the US-based crypto innovator Omar Sayed. Shardeum is a layer 1 blockchain project which will solve for scalability and higher transaction concerns around crypto tokens. Notably, Dubai has turned into a hotspot for cryptocurrency innovators and influencers after India imposed taxes on crypto transactions. India's crypto and web3 start-ups have flocked to UAE, especially Dubai, where there are no income tax provisions and the government has formed a regulatory body for trading in virtual digital assets.

            "content": " Indian cryptocurrency exchanges are going through a rough patch. The recently introduced 30 per cent tax on crypto gains brought down trading volumes to a steep low but the newly introduced taxation is not the only cause of concern for KYC compliant crypto exchanges in India. Here are some issues plaguing KYC compliant exchanges in India. MobiKwik suspends its services. Fintech giant and payment service provider MobiKwik suspended its services across all cryptocurrency exchanges from April 1. Many crypto investors preferred MobiKwik to deposit funds in their wallets to buy cryptos because of its relative speed as compared to bank transfers and lower threshold limits. MobiKwik declined to comment to the queries posed by Business Today. Liquidity providers back out. As previously reported by Business Today, cryptocurrency exchanges are witnessing a liquidity crunch. Liquidity providers have backed out due to low margins. High frequency traders provide liquidity to exchanges and because of the newly imposed tax regime, they have backed out.  \"High-frequency traders provide liquidity in the crypto market, enabling efficient buying and selling of assets,” Ashish Singhal, CEO of CoinSwitch Kuber told Business Today. UPI suspended across all exchanges. Coinbase recently announced full scale operations in India and promised its users the option to buy cryptocurrencies via UPI. After this, the National Payments Corporation of India (NPCI) released a statement saying that they were unaware of any Indian crypto exchange offering investors the option to buy crypto via UPI. BT reported that at least 4 exchanges operating in India had this option. And since Monday, UPI has been suspended across all Indian crypto exchanges.   Sathvik Vishwanath, the founder of Unocoin exchange, said, “We had UPI and bank transfer available till last week but we are only supporting bank transfers now.” UPI is also suspended across exchanges like CoinSwitch Kuber, CoinDCX, WazirX, etc. Banks distance themselves from crypto exchanges Banks have started distancing themselves from crypto exchanges due to the restrictive policies of the government when it comes to crypto and other virtual digital assets. Many banks have withdrawn the option buy cryptocurrencies via their channels on crypto exchanges.  Nischal Shetty, co-founder of WazirX exchange, said, “There has been reluctance from the banking industry to provide crypto exchanges with channels to deposit funds. However, we are in conversations with banking partners to iron out the issue at the earliest and help provide our users with other faster and hassle-free depositing methods.” It is noteworthy to mention that all these factors might tempt crypto investors to move towards decentralised exchanges (DEX). Akshat Shrivastava, finance influencer, is of the opinion that the government will actually lose out tax revenue if investors start migrating to such exchanges.  He said, “It is theoretically impossible for the government to track transactions on DEX and peer to peer markets (P2P), and this would actually promote crypto tax evasion.” Similar concerns were shared by Nischal Shetty. “The challenges that crypto investors are facing today can lead to an array of disadvantages for the entire system. It can also lead to traders transacting on P2P exchanges instead of the Indian exchanges that are KYC compliant. It will also result in the government losing out on tax revenues. Under such unfavorable circumstances, we will see more and more startups in crypto and Web3 move abroad. We must stop this brain drain by bringing in more conducive and concrete policies that will help us Make in India,” he added.   ",

Solana rose by 0.96 per cent. Avalanche is up by 1.82 per cent. Overall, all top tokens have recovered slightly after tanking on Monday. The events after the launch of Coinbase exchange in India have spelled trouble for all Indian exchanges. For starters, UPI has been withdrawn as an option to buy cryptocurrencies to avoid NPCI's wrath. Moreover, the other convenient mode of deposit, MobiKwik, has also suspended its services across all crypto exchanges in India. All these factors, coupled with the recently imposed 30 per cent tax on gains from virtual digital assets, which include cryptocurrencies, have caused a steep plunge in the trading volumes of cryptocurrency exchanges in India.

After this collaboration, Non-Standard Asset collectors would be able to use the tool Liquify provided by bitsCrunch to determine the value of their NSA holdings on Pawnfi. Thus, use them as collateral, and obtain loans.

Collaborating with Pawnfi helps us deliver the best-in-class solutions that address the needs of emerging NSA industry customers while transforming business landscapes.” Speaking about the partnership, Wesley Kayne, Pawnfi co-founder and CEO stated, “A significant portion of Pawnfi's business is in the NSA market. Since the metaverse is gaining momentum, liquidity and user base will be much higher than those associated with standard assets. We will continue to put forward innovative functions to ensure Pawnfi's advantage in the scale of assets it covers.

            "content": "In an interesting turn of events, the US Treasury Department has accused North Korean hacking organisation Lazarus, of stealing around $625 million in cryptocurrencies from the Axie Infinity-linked Ronin bridge, reportedly the biggest crypto heist ever. The Treasury Department added an Ethereum address to its sanctions list on Thursday. A wallet profiler had marked the wallet as “Ronin Bridge Exploiter”.  Chainalysis, a cryptocurrency analytics outfit, stated that the address \"was implicated in the Ronin hack.\" Elliptic, a tracing agency, calculated that over 14 per cent of the stolen assets had already been laundered by Friday. Chainanlysis has also released a detailed explanation for the same in a tweet thread. According to a Ronin Network blog post, the FBI has connected Lazarus to the validator breach, and the US Treasury Department has sanctioned the payments. “We are still in the process of adding additional security measures before redeploying the Ronin Bridge to mitigate future risk,” the blog stated. Last month, the sidechain Ronin, which is connected to the main Ethereum blockchain and utilized by developers of the play-to-earn game Axie Infinity, Sky Mavis, was hacked, resulting in the theft of 173,600 ETH and 25.5 million USDC, totalling a whopping $625 million at the time. It is noteworthy to mention that this is considered as the biggest crypto heist so far. Moreover, this is also the first time the US Treasury's sanctions division has banned a purported Lazarus-held cryptocurrency wallet. ",

The exchange announced that the product provides an opportunity for CrossTower’s customer base to take long and/or short positions, consistent with their portfolio and risk objectives. CrossTowers also announced in a statement that the perpetual futures trading feature is offered to qualified clients on an institutional-grade and  for regulated platforms.

            "content": "Elon Musk’s recent offer to buy the microblogging site Twitter has divided the platform again. Some are in favour of it and believe Musk would transform Twitter into a shrine of free speech. Others have opposing views and see this as a hostile takeover. One of the most interesting facets of this issue that has come out on the forefront is Twitter’s ties with Saudi Arabia. This too has divided the netizens on the microblogging site. There is one segment on Twitter which supports the theories that the site is being used as a means of espionage by the Saudi government. And, not surprising, there also tweets that try to pass these claims as conspiracy theories and hearsay. Let us dive into what the netizens on Twitter think about the Saudi-Twitter debacle in light of Elon Musk’s offer to buy the social networking site. The Twitter board’s ties with Saudi Arabia came into the spotlight on Thursday after Saudi businessman Talal Alwaleed took to Twitter to reject Elon’s offer to buy the microblogging site. Alwaleed tweeted, I don't believe that the proposed offer by @elonmusk ($54.20) comes close to the intrinsic value of @Twitter given its growth prospects.\n\nBeing one of the largest & long-term shareholders of Twitter, @Kingdom_KHC & I reject this offer.https://t.co/Jty05oJUTk pic.twitter.com/XpNHUAL6UX Michael Cernovich, an American alt-right social media personality, conspiracy theorist, and political commentator also took his views to Twitter. He questioned why Saudi Arabia was trying to stop Elon from taking over the microblogging site. Why is Saudi Arabia so obsessed with blocking the deal, and why is the regime media covering this up? It is noteworthy to mention that some of these tweets were also substantiated by proof. Alex Barredo, a tech enthusiast shared a link to a New York Times article about two former Twitter employees who were allegedly spying for Saudi Arabia. Hey Elon, don’t forget about this doozy https://t.co/IMahhIenBa Another netizen quoted a book that details how the Saudi government uses Twitter to silence dissent. In The book Blood and Oil, it goes in detail how they used Twitter to find some Saudi nationals who criticized the Saudi rule. Then there was another section of the microblogging site that considered these claims as hearsay and conspiracy theories. Some highlighted that Alwaleed was rejecting the offer only because the numbers did not add up. One user tweeted, Because $54 is a low ball non-serious offer for $TWTR.\n\nConsidering it’s 52 week high is $73, a serious bid would need to be $80-90 or more. This section of Twitter also tried to clarify that Alwaleed’s company, though it is named Kingdom Holding Company, does not have any ties with the royal family, although there were also counter claims which suggested that Alwaleed was related to the royal family. 🛑 Al-Waleed bin Talal is the owner of a holding company, not the Saudi government, and he has absolutely nothing to do with the state. However, as a response to this claim, a Twitter user from Saudi Arabia clarified that the Saudi family has over 5000 members. He clarified that Alwaleed is distantly related to the family and holds no office. Moreover, his organisation has also received a lot of heat from the Saudi government over corruption charges. He doesn't have any position in the government, His company was under investigation for corruption and he was held on for corruption. all these are facts. Saudi arabia's people and government has nothing to do with his personal and financial interests nor do we care. It is worth mentioning that Elon also participated in this lively debate. His tweets kept stirring the pot and acted as fuel to fire in the conversations. For instance, Musk had questions about journalistic freedom of speech. And asked this: Interesting. Just two questions, if I may.\n\nHow much of Twitter does the Kingdom own, directly & indirectly?\n\nWhat are the Kingdom’s views on journalistic freedom of speech? Elon also had a reply to Cernovich’s questions. Good question Well, it would be interesting to see how this situation pans out in the future.

            "header": "Bought for $2.9 mn, Jack Dorsey's first tweet NFT finds few takers",
            "content": "Crypto entrepreneur Sina Estavi made headlines in March 2021 when he paid $2.9 million for an NFT of Twitter boss Jack Dorsey's first tweet. But his efforts to re-sell it have run aground, with a top bid of just $6,800 as of Thursday. The initial purchase was at the time among the most expensive sales of a non-fungible token, or NFT, and came amid a flurry of interest in the niche crypto assets which have since generated billions of dollars in sales. Estavi put the tweet up for resale on the popular NFT marketplace OpenSea last week, initially asking for $48 million. \"My offer to sell was high and not everyone could afford it,\" Estavi, who was recently freed from jail in Iran, told Reuters via Twitter direct message, adding that he was no longer sure if he would sell the NFT. \"It's important to me who wants to buy it, I will not sell this NFT to anyone because I do not think everyone deserves this NFT,\" Estavi said. NFTs are a form of crypto asset which can record the ownership of a digital file such as an image, video or text. There is no guarantee of an NFT's value and the market is rife with scams, fraud, counterfeits and market manipulation. But Estavi was confident in the value of his purchase. \"This NFT is not just a tweet, this is the Mona Lisa of the digital world,\" he said. Victim of Crypto Estavi, who lives in Malaysia, said he had been arrested last May during a trip to Iran and held in solitary confinement until he was freed in February. Iranian state media reported in May 2021 that he was accused of \"disrupting the country's economic system\". Estavi said he had been arrested because of the growth of his crypto exchange, Bridge Oracle, and described himself as a \"victim of crypto\". Reuters was unable to independently verify these details. \"I need the support of the cryptocurrency community,\" Estavi told Reuters. While announcing the NFT sale in a tweet on April 6, he pledged to give 50% of the proceeds - which he expected to be at least $25 million - to charity. He said the rest would go to support Bridge Oracle. Also Read: Guarantee your income, no matter what the circumstances Also Read: Elon Musk offers to take over Twitter; here’s how netizens reacted ",

            "content": "Elon Musk has offered to buy the microblogging site Twitter and has been discussing various ways he plans to improve the platform.  At a TED conference held in Vancouver on Thursday, Musk informed the audience that if his bid to acquire Twitter was accepted, he would consider modifying the platform's approach to controversial and problematic content, including tweets by crypto scam bots.   “A top priority I would have is eliminating the spam and scam bots and the bot armies that are on Twitter” Musk told TED Curator Chris Anderson.  Musk explained that scam bots are extremely rampant on the microblogging site, and he used an interesting analogy to drive his point home.  “They (scam bots) make the product much worse. If I had a Dogecoin for every crypto scam I saw, we’d have 100 billion Dogecoin,\" Musk said. Musk’s mention of the meme coin caused a brief rally in the price of the token. As shown in the graph, Dogecoin briefly zoomed after Musk’s remarks.  Interestingly, Dogecoin is one of the few top tokens that is in the green today amid the bloodbath the crypto markets are witnessing.  Dogecoin also showed a brief uptrend last week when Elon suggested integrating Dogecoin as a payment option on Twitter Blue.   The token is trading at $0.1437 as of 10:30 am IST as per data from CoinMarketCap. It is noteworthy to mention that as of April 4, Elon was Twitter’s largest shareholder but was overtaken now by the Vanguard Group on Thursday.  The asset management firm increased its holdings to over 10 per cent, making them the majority shareholder in the microblogging site.

This is majorly because the 25 per cent added Bitcoin to their portfolio during the last year's all-time high or around that time. Furthermore, there has been some development in the Axie Infinity $625 million hack. The US department of treasury has said that the North Korean hackers might have a role in the theft.

It signals the latest move by crypto and incumbent financial networks to join forces as digital assets become more mainstream. Nexo said the card, available in selected European countries initially, allows users to spend without having to sell their digital assets such as bitcoin, which are used as collateral to back the credit granted. Most traditional credit cards are unsecured and have a set credit limit. The card is linked to a Nexo-provided, crypto-backed credit line and can be used at 92 million merchants worldwide where Mastercard is accepted, allowing investors to spend up to 90% of the fiat value of their crypto assets, Nexo said. \"The card requires no minimum repayments, monthly, or inactivity fees. There are no FX fees for up to 20,000 euros per month,\" Nexo said. There are no restrictions on how much a customer can spend or withdraw from the open credit line and interest is only paid on the amount of credit actually used. Interest remains at 0% for customers who maintain a loan-to-value ratio of 20% or below. \"Mastercard recognizes that digital assets are revolutionizing the financial landscape,\" said Raj Dhamodharan, Mastercard’s head of crypto and blockchain products and partnerships.

            "content": "The pilot project to upload 65,000 caste certificates of the tribal population of Etapalli subdivision, in Vidarbha's Gadchirioli district, on a blockchain-based platform was inaugurated on Wednesday by Maharashtra's minister of urban development and public works, Eknath Shinde.  Last month, assistant collector of Gadchiroli, Shubham Gupta announced via a LinkedIn post that the district administration would be issuing caste certificates which would be cryptographically anchored on the polygon blockchain via the LegitDoc platform. The bureaucrat told Business Today, “This will enable entities to instantly authenticate the certificates with the help of uncensorable, publicly auditable data stored on the public blockchain.” Neil Martis, founder of LegitDoc, the Web3 start-up through which this project is being launched told BT, “Projects like this would support the state administration to curb the menace of forgeries. It would also help in identifying the right beneficiaries for delivery of government schemes and benefits.”  He also further added, “Such an implementation sets a precedent for India to emerge as the frontier in building tech stacks on neutral web3 platforms, [which are] decentralisation-aligned, deplatformation-resistant alternatives to the censorship-prone US and Chinese dominated digital tech stacks. ” This new system would cryptographically commit selective details of every caste certificate fetched from the ‘MahaOnline’ portal on the polygon blockchain and generate a unique QR code consisting of blockchain proofs that would be embedded on each caste certificate. Furthermore, these certificates would be issued via common service centres (CSC), which are operational across all villages. The open verification system would be available on the government website and enable government departments or any other third parties to verify the authenticity of a certificate with the click of a button, making the process more streamline and tamper proof.

            "content": "Big Indian crypto exchanges CoinSwitch Kuber and WazirX have disabled rupee deposits for the purchase of cryptocurrency using a widely-used state-backed transfer system, spurring users to voice concern on social media. India has spent years on a law to ban or regulate cryptocurrencies, with its central bank backing a ban over their threat to financial stability, but a recent decision to tax income from them suggests acceptance by authorities. The decision follows a one-line statement last week by the National Payments Corporation of India saying, it was not aware of any crypto exchange using its United Payments Interface (UPI) framework, which eases bank transfers. On Wednesday, CoinSwitch's app was not allowing users to load deposits, while rival exchange WazirX said on Twitter, \"UPI is not available,\" adding that it had no estimated time to fix the issue with UPI deposits. \"You have closed the INR deposit without any information. At least let us know how long it will be closed,\" a Twitter user, Avijit Debnath, asked CoinSwitch on the social media platform. An industry source with direct knowledge of the matter said the decision by CoinSwitch to halt UPI acceptance resulted from \"regulatory uncertainty\" after the NPCI statement. The companies did not immediately respond to a Reuters request for comment.\nThe NPCI did not immediately respond. India decided in February to tax income from cryptocurrencies and other digital assets at 30%, signalling that authorities accepted digital currencies, but uncertainty over regulation has weighed on the industry. In October, CoinSwitch said it had raised more than $260 million for a valuation of $1.9 billion, underscoring the rise in popularity of crypto trading. No official data is available on the size of the Indian crypto market, but industry estimates suggest investors number from 15 million to 20 million, with total holdings of about 400 billion Indian rupees ($5.25 billion).

The funds were raised in a pre-seed funding round led by the angel investor firm Xceedance Venture Partners. Myraah is a technology startup that uses Artificial Intelligence (AI) to help SMEs, MSMEs, small businesses, and professional practitioners create a digital identity in English and several Indian languages. The startup announced in a release that the funds will help them build their Web 3 platform, which would allow users to create their Web3 digital identity and manage their digital assets such as files, pictures, music, videos, notes, documents, NFTs, domains, and websites. The firm also announced in a statement that Arun Balakrishnan, CEO, and co-founder of Gurgaon-based angel investor Xcelerator Venture Partners, and other angel investors participated in the round.  Web3 refers to the next step in the evolution of the internet. It is serverless, open, and built around users' privacy and ownership. Speaking about his investment in Myraah, Arun Balakrishnan said, “I have always taken a keen interest in start-ups working with transformational technology. I believe Myraah’s Web3 platform has the potential to alter the internet space in India by giving users control over their content.” Gaurav Kumar, co-founder, and CEO of Myraah said, “We thank our investors for showing confidence in our platform. The advent of Web3 will usher a new era for over six hundred million internet users in India and we hope to onboard 500K early adopters in the first year.” Myraah also announced in the release that currently their platform will offer a Web 3.0 Locker which would be private and secure storage for user’s files, pictures, videos, and NFTs, and a Web 3.0 Website Builder, a tool that would enable anyone to create a Web 3 website without the need of coding and any other IT skills.

The exchange announced that the first of the three instalments of the animated short film series, named \"The Degen Trilogy,\" will premiere in June at NFT.NYC, including plot contributions from both apes and non-apes in the NFT community. Moreover, owners of the Bored Apes Yacht Club NFT are welcome to submit their apes for consideration as characters in the trilogy, along with fictional character descriptions that will be examined by the casting director. Coinbase also announced that after the release, the movies would be “wallet-gated” on the Coinbase website. Which means users would have to create a Coinbase wallet before being able watch the movie. It is noteworthy to mention that Yuga Labs, the creator of the NFT collectible series, is not directly involved with the film’s production. Previously the NFT collectible was in the news when it launched its native token, ApeCoin. The token was listed on Binance, Coinbase, FTX, Huobi, OKX, and Kraken. Interestingly, the token fell over 80 per cent in value after being listed.  This is not the first time the apes from the Bored Ape Yacht Club will be featured out of the BAYC ecosystem. Universal Music Group (UMG) is assembling a band around the recently acquired Bored Ape NFT. Also, on April 9, a California-based BAYC-themed restaurant debuted, which accepts ApeCoin, the native token of the BAYC ecosystem, as a payment option. ",

            "content": "Bitbns crypto exchange announced the listing of its Alien Worlds native token, Trilium (TLM) in a release on Tuesday. Trilium is essentially an NFT metaverse token native to Alien Worlds. Alien Worlds is a decentralised metaverse that runs on multiple blockchains, namely Ethereum, WAX, and Binance Smart Chain (BSC). The exchange announced that in relation to the token, Ethereum is a useful blockchain for storing and accessing Trilium (TLM). WAX serves as a game and NFT-focused blockchain. Whereas BSC is an appealing consumer-centric chain with a rapidly growing user base and affordable transactions. The Alien Worlds metaverse is a simulated economy where players compete for the scarce resource within the ecosystem, namely Trilium (TLM) token, which is used for staking and voting in Planet Decentralised Autonomous Organisations (Planet DAOs). Planets and the players compete for TLM, which results in intense competition and collaboration between groups. The exchange clarified in the release that in the Alien Worlds metaverse, players can acquire NFTs to mine TLM, participate in battles, and complete the in-game quests.   Trilium (TLM) is the cross-chain ERC-20 / BEP-20 / WAX fungible token that connects the metaverse and allows the transfer of value and voting in Planet DAOs, the exchange said in a statement. This cross-chain mechanism seeks to enable the Alien Worlds metaverse to interact with projects on several chains, allowing explorers to choose storage for their Trilium.  Sarojini McKenna, the co-founder of AlienWorlds, said on the occasion of listing \"India comprises up to 4 per cent of Alien Worlds' game site traffic. It made perfect sense for us to penetrate the Indian market and partner with Bitbns. With Bitbns round-the-clock fiat on/off ramps, academy programs, fixed income plans, and other great products, Alien Worlds aims to provide a seamless experience to our users with their journey into the metaverse.\" Commenting on the development, Keerthan Shetty, Business Development Director of Bitbns said, \"In our constant endeavor of offering unique propositions to customers, we delighted to bring Alien Worlds (TLM) token, one of the top metaverse, to India. With rapidly growing gamers in India, Bitbns is happy to support the listing and more partnerships.\"   ",

            "content": "Fintech giant MobiKwik has suspended its UPI services for all cryptocurrency exchanges operating in India. Interestingly, many media reports suggested that this development followed NPCI's statement.  However, this does not seem to be the case. Last week, the international crypto-exchange Coinbase had announced full-scale operations in India, including options to buy cryptos via UPI. Soon after, the National Payments Corporation of India, or NPCI released a statement claiming that it was not aware of any crypto exchange operating in India which allows users to buy cryptos using UPI.\nBut BT found that despite NPCI’s statement, at least four crypto exchanges operating in India allowed users to buy cryptocurrencies via UPI. These exchanges were CoinDCX, CoinSwitch Kuber, Unocoin, and Coinbase. Also Read: Coinbase announces full scale crypto trading in India But soon after NPCI released its statement, Coinbase suspended the option to buy crypto via UPI. Moreover, MobiKwik was also down on all crypto exchanges operating in India. Several media reports suggested that the payment service provider had suspended its services because of the NPCI statement. But BT has found that MobiKwik's services across crypto exchanges have been down for more than ten days now.  Also Read: NPCI says unaware of exchanges offering UPI as an option for buying crypto but some already do Sathvik Vishwanath, founder and CEO of Unocoin, said: \"They [MobiKwik] stopped their services for all exchanges about 10-12 days ago”. The spokesperson of WazirX also confirmed to BT that MobiKwik's suspension of its payment services for crypto exchanges happened before the NPCI statement and is not related to that. MobiKwik declined to comment on our queries. ",

It is noteworthy to mention that Giottus is the only bootstrapped exchange in India to have achieved this feat. The exchange also announced in a statement that they offer their services in eight Indian languages including Hindi, Tamil, and Telugu.  Moreover, the exchange is also among the early members of the Blockchain and Crypto Assets Council (BACC) in India. BACC is an association of crypto-related service providers in India that follow self-regulatory measures such as full KYC and transaction monitoring processes.  Interestingly, Giottus has partnered with Bitgo, a custodial service provider, to secure its platform from cyberattacks. On the occasion of hitting the 1 million investors mark, Giottus Chief Executive Officer Vikram Subburaj said, “Crypto investors go through varied emotions as market movements and regulatory uncertainties necessitate a brand to communicate frequently with investors in their language of preference. Excellent customer support in multiple vernacular languages like Hindi, Tamil, & Telugu makes Giottus the preferred and trusted name in the crypto ecosystem.” Furthermore, the platform plans to offer fixed deposits on crypto assets as well as staking features in the near future. “We aim to provide a comprehensive suite of investment products to all our customers who focus on building wealth for the long term. The crypto industry is set for further growth and maturity in India over the next few years and Giottus will continue to be at the forefront with innovative features and best-in-class service,” the CEO said.

            "content": "The recently introduced taxation on crypto has impacted crypto trading on KYC compliant cryptocurrency exchanges gravely. Exchanges are witnessing a steep drop in trading volumes and liquidity providers are also backing out, thereby causing a liquidity crunch. Last week, Business Today had reported on the drop in trading volumes on KYC compliant crypto exchanges. Interestingly, this trend is being observed this week as well. The trading volumes on crypto exchanges is continuously dropping as shown in the graphs below. In the past week, the trading volumes on CoinDCX have dropped significantly. Similar trends were observed on WazirX exchange as well. Trading volumes on ZebPay also went through a steep decline. The drop in trading volume is not the only cause of concern for KYC compliant crypto exchanges across India. Exchanges are also going through a liquidity crunch caused by concerns of liquidity providers. Sathvik Vishwanath, founder and CEO of Unocoin exchange, told Business Today \"The liquidity provider margins are very thin. So, they may need to come up with a new strategy itself\". The 1 per cent TDS on crypto transactions is the main driving force behind this frenzy. It is noteworthy to mention that the provision would be applicable from July 1 but liquidity providers seem to be taking a cautionary stance. \"High-frequency traders provide liquidity in the crypto market, enabling efficient buying and selling of assets. These traders operate on extremely thin margins, and locking up their capital with high TDS will restrict their ability to operate, lowering market liquidity and eventually impacting retail investors,\" Ashish Singhal, Founder and CEO, CoinSwitch told Business Today. Minal Thukral, Vice President - Growth and Strategy at CoinDCX said \"The 1 per cent TDS provision has impacted liquidity providers and high-frequency traders, raising concerns around the viability of the business. We are seeking clarification from the government on whether losses can be mitigated inside a single VDA transaction. \" The recently introduced crypto tax provisions seem to have negatively impacted crypto trading on KYC compliant exchanges. Moreover, it seems like a bumpy road ahead. We would have to wait and watch how this pans out in the near future.   ",

            "content": "Jarindr Thitadilaka says he made as much as $2,000 a month last year from his collection of digital pets, which he would breed and send into battle to win cryptocurrencies. The 28-year-old from Bangkok was playing Axie Infinity, one of a new breed of blockchain-based online games, dubbed \"play-to-earn\", which blend entertainment with financial speculation. These games can make for lucrative businesses amid the hype around NFTs and virtual worlds, attracting millions of players plus billions of dollars from investors who see the games as a way to introduce more people to cryptocurrency. In Axie Infinity, users buy virtual blob-like creatures with varying attributes as NFTs, or non-fungible tokens - digital assets whose owner is recorded on the blockchain - for anything from tens of dollars to hundreds of thousands. read more Players can then use the pets to earn money by winning battles, as well as creating new pets, whose value depends on their rarity. The assets can be traded with other players on the platform, which says it has about 1.5 million daily users. \"It's not just a game any more. It's more like an ecosystem,\" said Thitadilaka. \"You can even call it a country, right?\" The dangers of this speculative ecosystem, and the largely unregulated crypto gaming industry, were brought into sudden focus last week when Axie Infinity was hit by a $615 million heist. Hackers targeted a part of the system used to transfer cryptocurrency in and out of the game. read more Axie Infinity's Vietnam-based owner, Sky Mavis, said it would reimburse the lost money through a combination of its own balance sheet funds and $150 million raised by investors including cryptocurrency exchange Binance and venture capital firm a16z. read more Sky Mavis' co-founder Aleksander Larsen told Reuters that if he could do things differently, he would have focused more on security when growing the game, which was launched in 2018. \"We were running 100 miles per hour, basically, to even get to this point,\" he said. \"The trade-offs we made maybe weren't the ideal ones.\" The hack, one of the biggest crypto heists ever, shone a light on play-to-earn games, a young world largely unknown outside crypto and gaming circles, that's becoming big business. Players spent $4.9 billion on NFTs in games last year, according to market tracker DappRadar, representing around 3% of the global gaming industry. Although demand has cooled since a peak last November, gaming NFTs have still racked up $484 million in sales so far in 2022. read more Investor interest in NFT-based games has also ballooned, with projects attracting $4 billion of venture capital funding last year, up from $80,000 in 2020, DappRadar said. \"There's so many users who want to interact with the tech,\" said Larsen, adding that Axie Infinity's revenues exceeded $1.3 billion last year. \"It's like you found a new continent ... like finding America all over again.\" Adding layers of complexity, unofficial financial networks have also emerged around these games, as some players leverage their coveted in-game possessions for further gain. Thitadilaka in Thailand decided last July that he wanted make more money than he could by simply playing on his own, so he and his friends decided to form what's known in gaming lingo as a \"guild\". They allowed their NFTs to be used by people who wanted to play Axie Infinity for free, without investing in an asset, and took a cut of any winnings in return. This model is commonplace across play-to-earn games. Thitadilaka said his guild, GuildFi, grew into a network with 3,000 Axie Infinity players who split their earnings with the asset-owners 50:50. Thitadilaka now runs GuildFi as a full-time job and the company has raised $146 million from investors. Southeast Asian countries such as Thailand and the Philippines have emerged as some of the hottest global gaming hubs. Teriz Pia, who is 25 and lives in Manila, quit her job as a pre-school teacher last June after her brother founded a play-to-earn gaming guild, Real Deal Guild. Now she says she makes as much as $20,000 a month through her network of more than 300 players across multiple games, plus other crypto assets. For Axie Infinity Pia lets her players keep 70%, while she takes a 30% cut. In another play-to-earn game, Pegaxy, where players buy and trade NFTs of virtual horses to compete in races to win crypto tokens, she splits it 60:40. \"I don't call them workers. I just call them my friends, or my scholars,\" she said. \"The salary in the Philippines if you're a teacher ... I'm a college graduate, I'm an educator, but it's not enough. I never imagined that I could earn this kind of money.\" But Pia cautioned that it was a dangerous business. \"There's a lot of risk. When I'm investing in a new game ... being a member of Real Deal Guild, we have a partnership team, we have researchers, but at the end of the day, it's still crypto, it's still a risk.\" One of the biggest play-to-earn networks, Yield Guild Games, said it had 10,000 Axie Infinity players as of the fourth quarter of 2021 who kept 70% of their earnings and had received $11.7 million in total. Australian-based Corey Wilton, 25, founded Pegaxy, which he says has about 160,000 daily users. He estimates that 95% of users of play-to-earn games participate as \"renters\", generating revenue without owning the assets, while 5% are asset owners. 'HOW PEOPLE GET HURT' Legal experts warn there is no safety net for players who effectively invest in risky assets, leaving them highly vulnerable should a project fail or the market for the assets dry up. As global regulators seek to get to grips with cryptocurrencies themselves, there is little oversight of NFTs or the relatively niche offshoot of play-to-earn games, which typically use in-game crypto tokens that can then be cashed out into traditional money. \"Storing any value in projects like this is risky. The earning in play to earn, blockchain-based games is often through rewards paid in the native token of the project,\" said David Lee, cryptocurrency associate at London-based law firm Fladgate. \"There are no guaranteed values of either the token or the in-game asset as their value is often determined by supply and demand in the market. This means there can be significant volatility in the price and, if the project becomes less popular or is abandoned, then there is a potential for the assets to become worthless.\" Yet advocates of these games say success is built upon a combination of factors such as skill, strategy and luck. \"There is definitely money to be made, but there is also money to be lost here,\" Pegaxy's Wilton added. \"Play to earn should not be confused with charity, that's how people get hurt.\"   Also Read: Direct tax collection in FY22 grew 49%, indirect tax collection 30%: Revenue Secy Also Read: HDFC divests 3% stake in Bandhan Bank for Rs 1,522 cr ",

            "content": "After staunchly denying rumors of accepting Bitcoin as a legal tender for the whole country, Honduras has now accepted Bitcoin as legal currency for the special economic zone \"Honduras Prospera\". Officials in charge of the special economic zone (SEZ), which is a tourist-centric island in Honduras' Caribbean, announced on Thursday that they would be adopting the cryptocurrency Bitcoin as legal tender in the area. The special economic zone Honduras Prospera was established in 2020 to help encourage investment in the area and has administrative, fiscal, and budgetary autonomy. \"Prospera's flexible regulatory framework enables crypto-innovation and the use of Bitcoin by residents, businesses, and governments,\" Honduras Prospera said in a statement. Moreover, the economic zone will also let municipalities, local governments, and international firms issue bitcoin bonds from the area's jurisdiction. Honduras Prospera covers parts of the picturesque Roatan island as well as the city of La Ceiba on Honduras' Atlantic Coast. Interestingly, the Central Bank of Honduras has time and again expressed its apprehension for cryptocurrencies. Last week a representative of the bank said that they cannot vouch for cryptocurrency transactions. \"Any transaction carried out with this type of virtual asset falls under the responsibility and risk of the person carrying it out,\" the bank said in a statement recently. It is noteworthy to mention that neighboring country El Salvador adopted bitcoin as legal tender last year in September, making it the first country in the world to adopt a cryptocurrency as a recognized means of exchange.

            "header": "Nuanced, calibrated approach essential for digital currency launch: RBI Dy Guv",
            "content": "Reserve Bank of India Deputy Governor T Rabi Sankar on Thursday said a nuanced and calibrated approach is essential for launch of India's maiden digital currency as it would have various implications for the economy and monetary policy. RBI is planning to come out with a central bank backed digital currency using blockchain technology in 2022-23. ''Given the large number of uncertainties in terms of which model works, which design works well in terms of its impact on the banking system, on data privacy on monetary policy, I think almost all central banks and we are no exception will probably go in for a very careful and calibrated nuanced manner,'' he said at an event organised by ICRIER. The essential learning does not come from global experience but basically comes from your own experience, he said. Observing that one of the principles for introduction of any technologies, especially for a central bank, is that it should ''do no harm'', he said, ''I think central banks would go about it in a very calibrated, graduated manner, assessing impact all along the line and then making those connections with what is most demanded.'' As far as India is concerned, he emphasised that RBI is looking at Central Bank Digital Currency (CBDC) as just as the digital form of paper currency and no distinction whatsoever. Highlighting that CBDC would have cost and distributional efficiency, he said, the other motivation for introduction is settlement efficiency. It will significantly bring down time taken for cross border transactions and make transaction real time, he said. About the implications of CBDCs, he said, ''while these motivations do exist, one must realise that global experience is virtually non-existent at this point in time on a few things like CBDCs might affect the banking system.'' CBDCs could affect the transactional demand for deposits in the banking system, he said. ''To the extent that happens, the deposit creation would get affected negatively and to that extent the ability to create credit by the banking system also goes down... to the extent low cost transactional deposits move away from the banking system, the average cost of deposits might go up, which generally would lead to slight upward pressure on the cost of funds in the system itself,'' he said. The other implication would be on monetary policy, he said, adding that surveys done by BIS and others seem to indicate that most central banks feel it will have an impact on monetary policy and impact on transmission. With regard to stable coin, he said, it could emerge as much bigger threat to dollarisation than a cryptocurrency. Stable coin is a kind of cryptocurrency backed by assets. Cryptocurrencies are so volatile that it cannot be used for small value transactions, he said, citing the example of Tesla where it had announced that cryptocurrencies can be used for buying its cars. Later, the company withdrew the decision considering the volatility of cryptocurrencies. Further, Shankar said that RBI and the Monetary Authority of Singapore (MAS) would soon link their respective fast payment systems. Under this initiative, India's home-grown payments system, the Unified Payments Interface (UPI), will be linked with Singapore's PayNow. The UPI-PayNow linkage will enable users of each of the two fast payment systems to make instant, low-cost fund transfers on a reciprocal basis without a need to get onboarded onto the other payment system. Speaking during the event Chief Economic Adviser V Anantha Nageswaran said even the launch of CBDC will not obviate the need to regulate cryptocurrency as they will continue to exist. Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman, in her Budget speech on February 1, had announced that digital rupee or CBDC would be issued by the RBI in the coming fiscal year. She had also announced the government will levy 30 per cent tax on gains made from any other private digital assets from April 1.

            "content": "Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen says more government regulation is needed to police the proliferation of cryptocurrency and other digital assets and to ward off fraudulent and illicit transactions. In practice, one result would be that users would get documentation of their crypto dealings for use in filing their taxes. “Taxpayers should receive the same type of tax reporting on digital asset transactions that they receive for transactions in stocks and bonds, so that they have the information they need to report their income to the IRS,” Yellen said in remarks prepared for delivery Thursday at American University. It was to be Yellen's first speech about cryptocurrency since President Joe Biden signed an executive order on digital assets in March. The administration's action follows several high-profile examples of alleged cryptocurrency laundering and fraud this year. In February, the Justice Department announced its largest-ever financial seizure — more than $3.6 billion — and the arrests of a couple accused of conspiring to launder billions of dollars in cryptocurrency stolen from the 2016 hack of a virtual currency exchange. And in March, federal regulators accused two siblings of defrauding thousands of investors out of $124 million in unregistered securities offerings involving a digital token. “To the extent there are gaps, we will make policy recommendations, including assessment of potential regulatory actions and legislative changes,” Yellen said in her remarks. Biden's executive order on government oversight of cryptocurrency urges the Federal Reserve to explore whether the central bank should create its own digital currency and directs the Treasury Department and other federal agencies to study the impact of cryptocurrency on financial stability and national security. As banks and other traditional financial firms become more involved in digital asset markets, Yellen said, “regulatory frameworks will need to appropriately reflect the risks of these new activities.” The use of cryptocurrency and other digital assets have exploded in recent years. Surveys show that roughly 16% of adult Americans — or 40 million people — have invested in cryptocurrencies. And 43% of men age 18 to 29 have put their money into cryptocurrency. “Our regulatory frameworks should be designed to support responsible innovation while managing risks – especially those that could disrupt the financial system and economy,” Yellen said. Lawmakers and administration officials have also voiced concerns that Russia may be using cryptocurrency to avoid the impact of the avalanche of sanctions imposed on banks, oligarchs and the energy industry in the past weeks due to the invasion of Ukraine. But Treasury officials and cryptocurrency experts have said crypto is not a workaround for sanctions.

            "content": "As part of its aggressive India expansion plans, Nasdaq-listed crypto exchange Coinbase plans to build a dedicated local team that will look into potential investments and acquisition opportunities in the country. “India is a very critical region for us, we want to go extremely deeper here, so it warrants having a dedicated individual who focuses on and leads mergers and acquisition (M&A) and investments in India,” Shan Aggarwal. Vice President, Head of Corporate Development & Coinbase Ventures, told Business Today.  “We will hire a lead for the country and grow from there. In going forward, there will be a dedicated team for Coinbase ventures both out of the US and locally in India. The new appointments will be part of the regional strategy. He or she will work with our US and global teams.” Coinbase Venture is the venture investment arm of the California-based company. Coinbase has invested over $150 million in Indian technology start-ups, including CoinDCX and Coinswitch Kuber, both of which are now valued over $1 billion.  Technology and talent are the primary focuses for acquisition in India while ecosystem creation drives its start-up investment thesis. “We are always looking at acquisitions and investments, across different sizes and phases. The once that we are particularly focused in India region are really technology and talent. We are busy building our own products, and there are great technologies and teams that we can acquire and integrate into our existing organization to better our end products,” Aggarwal said. Coinbase Ventures in partnership with Buidlers Tribe is hosting a startup pitch event on Friday where seven start-ups are scheduled to present. The company will invest up to $1 million in selected start-ups.  “It’s just a start. There are no limitations necessarily, nor have we set a threshold to our investments. We want to invest globally in the best entrepreneurs and projects. I am very positive and confident that a lot of those are going to come from India. I have already seen it firsthand. We are going to be hosting more such programs with local ecosystem partners,” he added.  Coinbase launched full scale crypto trading in India on Thursday. The company announced that its customers will be able to purchase cryptos through the exchange by using the Unified Payments Interface (UPI), the payment method that now accounts for 60 per cent of retail payment traffic in the India. On Monday, the company’s CEO Brian Armstrong announced on his blog that the exchange is planning to hire over 1000 people for their India office.  It already has 300 employees currently working at their Hyderabad and Bengaluru offices.   ",

Coinbase, which is the world's second-largest exchange by trade volume, said that customers will be able to purchase cryptos through the exchange by using the Unified Payments Interface (UPI), a payment method that now accounts for 60 per cent of retail payment traffic in the India. Interestingly, crypto trading in India has been hit significantly because of the new tax laws. Trading volumes on Indian crypto exchanges have dropped significantly and exchanges are also facing liquidity crunches. And CEO Brian Armstrong did acknowledge these constraints while speaking at the event. He said, \"We know it's not going to be a straight shot to bring this technology. We don't know exactly how it's going to evolve. But we're committed to working with bank partners, regulators, most importantly, the Indian people because they've shown a real spark of interest in cryptocurrency, and there's a real desire to get access to some of these services and products.\" On Monday, Armstrong had announced on his blog that the exchange is planning to hire over 1000 people for their India office. Moreover, he also spoke about the exchange’s investments in Indian crypto startups and highlighted that the exchange has plans of further expansion in the country.

            "content": "Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman, while presenting the Union Budget 2022-2023 announced that all gains on digital assets, including cryptocurrency, will be taxed at 30 per cent. And the government’s decision to tax the crypto has stirred up the debate about the rationality of the decision, mostly among crypto enthusiasts. But former member of Parliament and well-known economist Subramanian Swamy, in an exclusive conversation with Business Today, has said that the imposition of 30 per cent tax on crypto is nonsensical and absurd. “You [government] first don't recognise it but you say you will tax it, which is absurd. Either you recognise it or you don't recognise it. If you don't recognise it, then go after them, but you say no whatever earnings they make -- which means you allow them to make [those] earnings -- and if you tax the earnings how can you call that illegal anymore?” Swamy said. According to him, the government’s stance of supporting blockchain technology but being against crypto is just like being in the favour of a car but not for the steering wheel. “When civilisation began or the human beings started making progress, the first thing was he started with barter trade then over a period of time, this gold coin came, then paper currency came in, but it had a gold backing. Then now we have a paper currency altogether. Now this is going again, back to barter exchange, because the transactions are between the two of us and no money is physically changed. That's our computer age.  It is a computerised version of the old age bartar system,” Swamy pointed out. Swamy, as a matter of fact, believes that crypto is the future. He further highlighted the pitfalls of having a crypto tax at this stage. According to him, not only does the tax rate act as a disincentive, but can also lead to a flight of talent from the country. “If you will not allow [crypto] then people will do it in black. And also it will lead to a flight of talent from our country,” Swamy said. ",

            "content": "Crypto exchange Binance is leading investors' contribution to a bailout of victims of a $615 million digital coin theft, the company targeted in the heist said on Wednesday. The Vietnam-based company Sky Mavis, which runs the game Axie Infinity, said last week it had been hit by one of the largest crypto heists on record, leaving users unable to withdraw their money from the game.  Sky Mavis said it would reimburse the lost money through a combination of its own balance sheet funds and $150 million raised by investors including cryptocurrency exchange Binance and venture capital firm a16z. \"Sky Mavis is committed to reimbursing all of our users' lost funds and implementing rigorous internal security measures to prevent future attacks,\" said Trung Nguyen, CEO of Sky Mavis. The part of the network which was hacked, a blockchain \"bridge\" called Ronin, which allows users to move funds in and out of the game, will reopen after a security upgrade and audits which \"can take several weeks\", Sky Mavis said. The \"funding round\" will allow users to withdraw and deposit their money, the company said. Binance CEO Changpeng Zhao said \"we strongly believe Sky Mavis will bring a lot of value and growth for the larger industry and we believe it's necessary to support them as they work hard to resolve the recent incident.\" Binance and Sky Mavis did not put a figure on how much of the $150 million Binance would provide. Sky Mavis's game, Axie Infinity, allows its 2.2 million players to buy and trade in-game assets in the form of NFTs, which they compete against each other to earn crypto tokens. read more \"While racing for mainstream adoption, we made some trade-offs that ended up leaving us vulnerable to this sort of attack,\" a blog post on the Axie Infinity website announcing the fundraise said. \"It's a lesson that we've learned the hard way.\" Hacks have long plagued the $2.1 trillion crypto sector, which saw an influx of investment during the COVID-19 pandemic. In February, a crypto platform called Wormhole lost $320 million in what was one of the largest crypto heists on record at the time. The cryptocurrency arm of Jump Trading, which had recently acquired Wormhole's developer, provided funds to replace the stolen money.\n  Also Read: MEITY formulates advisory committee for India's semiconductor mission Also Read: COVID-19: First case of Omicron sub-variant XE reported in Mumbai ",

Moreover, the European Commission's Directorate General for Financial Stability, Financial Services, and Capital Markets Union announced on Tuesday that it will conduct an investigation into the impact of the central bank's digital currency on financial service providers, retail users, and chambers of commerce. The aforementioned panel will engage with industry experts on issues such as international payments, privacy, the influence on the banking system and financial stability, alternative payment methods to cash, and compliance with anti-money laundering and counter-terrorism financing legislation. Consultations on the digital euro will supplement those done by the European Central Bank, which recently published the conclusions of its September 2021 discussion groups. As per the feedback from the general public and retailers, the prospective deployment of a digital euro might benefit both online and offline use cases. Responses to the European Commission will be accepted until June 14. It is noteworthy to mention that the European Commission's finance chief, Mairead McGuinness, stated in February that laws establishing the digital euro will be submitted in 2023.  Interestingly, the European Central Bank has been investigating the possibility of developing a digital euro, as global interest in central bank digital currencies appears to be growing. A consultation conducted by the European Central Bank from October 2020 to January 2021 concluded that a digital euro might help lower interest rates, speed up transaction procedures, and reduce reliance on cash.

            "content": "During the Union Budget 2022, Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman introduced a flat 30 per cent tax on all gains arising from the sale of virtual digital assets, including cryptocurrencies.  Moreover, the Finance Minister also introduced 1 per cent TDS on all crypto transactions. This led to a far and wide outcry amid the Indian crypto community which called the latest provisions “regressive” and “detrimental”.  Now a section of the crypto community is pointing out that the current system has loopholes as crypto taxes can be avoided by using decentralised exchanges (DEX) such as PancakeSwap and Uniswap, or by indulging in peer-to-peer crypto transactions. So, does this work? Can one work around the existing crypto tax regulations in the country? We take a look.   In theory, yes this seems like valid reasoning. Using decentralised crypto exchanges -- which are exchanges that allow direct P2P cryptocurrency transactions without intermediaries and do not require KYC -- does seem like the way to go if you want to avoid taxes but crypto users need to realise that navigating decentralised tools are extremely complicated, and the risk is completely borne by the investor.  Moreover, the moment investors convert their crypto gains to fiat, they would have to pay taxes on them. Also, it would be utterly foolish to believe that India's tax department, and its financial intelligence and enforcement agencies, will not be aware of these developments. Some comments on the tweet also point to these factors. Crypto educator and influencer Kashif Raza told Business Today that along with the tax rules, the government should have also issued a guideline to better implement the recent taxation. When asked if using DEX and P2P methods to avoid taxes is a good idea, he said: “Not a great idea at all. If the government has proposed taxes, then one should not find ways to avoid that as it is the duty of every citizen to declare and pay taxes. I feel the government should have come up with regulations first with proper guidelines on do's and don'ts and then they should have proposed taxes.” When asked if the present crypto tax regime would promote grey markets and tax evasion, Pratik Gauri, co-founder, and CEO of 5ire blockchain told BT: “Every tax law, sooner or later, has a loophole detected in it, and India’s crypto tax law would not be an exception. [Using DEX and P2P] is similar to the idea of using just cash to avoid income taxes. The trick might work for a while, but the govt will catch up and it’ll become virtually impossible.” One of the major reasons why evading taxes via DEX and P2P markets would not work, experts argue, is because investors would have to convert their crypto gains to fiat at some point in time; because only then would they be able to buy goods or services in India as cryptocurrencies are not a legal tender in the country yet. However, there are still some places across the country which accept cryptocurrencies as a means of exchange.  Ardor2.1, a restaurant in the central part of India's capital New Delhi, accepts crypto payments for their ‘digital thali’. A tattoo parlor in Delhi's Greater Kailash, Devilz Tattooz, also accepts cryptocurrencies as a mode of payment. But such examples are rare. Trying to evade crypto taxes via DEX and P2P might seem like a tempting option, but the underlying risks, as well as consequences, are important to keep in mind.

In a release, the firm, founded by Indian entrepreneurs, announced that it will use the funds to launch its operation in the Indian and European markets, further strengthening its product development process and adding more talent to the senior management across its legal, compliance, institutional relationships, and design functions. Speaking about the fundraise, Sachin Singh, CEO, and co-founder of Kassio, said, \"This successful pre-seed funding round is a testimony to the strength of our project Kassio, its roadmap, offerings, and the innovation that brings together crypto investment and much-required crypto utility features\". Swedish investors at Aalto Capital, along with two major European investment funds, immediately saw the potential of Kassio and its team. In February of 2022, they decided to invest $1.6 million in the company's pre-seed round of funding to accelerate and globally scale the company's mission of making crypto mainstream.  Shayan Khan, Partner at Aalto Capital, added, \"While crypto is the next biggest equaliser after the Internet revolution, Kassio, with its strong offerings, is a project that changes the whole dynamics of the community. I am confident that Kassio will be instrumental in providing quality crypto offerings to end-users and bring about the change that the world has been waiting for in this ecosystem.\" The platform announced in a statement on Wednesday that while its product is set to exit private beta in mid-April in India and mid-May in the EU, the platform already has an AUM (Digital Assets under Management) worth $ 16 million and a loan playbook of $9 million.  The freshly raised round will accelerate the execution of the product and plans in the pipeline.

            "content": "As per the findings of the 2022 PwC CBDC Global Index report, more than 80 per cent of central banks across the world are considering launching a central bank digital currency (CBDC) or have already done so. The PwC CBDC Global Index analyses and ranks the leading retail and wholesale CBDC projects. The index evaluates the current stage of CBDC project development also taking into account central bank opinion and public interest. “Given the fall in cash use and the rise in cryptocurrencies, our new report gives a timely update on the progress and development of CBDCs,” said Haydn Jones, PwC. According to the report, retail CBDC projects, which are digital currencies designed for public use, have reached greater maturity levels than wholesale projects which are digital currencies used by financial institutions that have accounts with central banks. But the past year has seen progress on a number of successful wholesale pilots. The Index's retail CBDC list is led by the Central Bank of Nigeria’s eNaira which is Africa's first CBDC, and the Sand Dollar, which was issued as legal tender by the Central Bank of the Bahamas in October 2020. The report also focuses on China, which became the first major economy to pilot a CBDC with the introduction of the digital yuan in 2020, and as of March 2022, 12 cities, including Beijing and Shanghai are running pilot projects. India’s effort to launch its own retail CBDC, the 'Digital Rupee' by the Reserve Bank of India is also mentioned in the report. As per the index, flagship CBDC project on the wholesale side is a collaboration between the Hong Kong Monetary Authority (HKMA) and the Bank of Thailand (BoT) to launch the mBridge project, which is focused on developing a proof-of-concept prototype for real-time, cross-border foreign exchange payments using distributed ledger technology. The work of Singapore's Monetary Authority (MAS) is also highly regarded as per the list. “CBDCs will facilitate more effective, lower cost and 24/7/365 cross-border payments for the financial services industry,” said Gary Ng, Partner Risk Assurance, PwC Hong Kong.  The PwC research also discusses stablecoins, which are digital currencies that are collateralized by a fiat currency and can be used to build a bridge between the existing financial environment and digital technology.

The cryptocurrency exchange has donated the equivalent of $2.5 million in BUSD through Binance charity. BUSD is a stablecoin developed in a collaboration between New York-based trading and custody platform Paxos and Binance.  Stablecoins bridge the world of cryptocurrency and fiat currency together as their prices are tied to a reserve asset like the US dollar or gold.

Four million people have found safety in neighbouring countries like Poland, Moldova, Romania and Hungary, while millions more have been forced from their homes but remain inside Ukraine.    This is the latest donation following Binance's $10 million commitment to help people impacted by the crisis in Ukraine.  Through Binance Charity, more than $4.5 million has already been donated, bringing the total amount to $7 million including the funding to USA for UNHCR. The remaining $3 million donation is being finalised and will be announced shortly.   \"In addition to the $10 million commitment, Binance Charity launched a crowd-funding platform, which has raised approximately $900K USD from the crypto community. This money will also be allocated to humanitarian efforts,\" the statement added.

Meanwhile, Helen Hai, Head of Binance Charity, said, \"We are proud that we've been able to work with UNHCR to deliver its first BUSD crypto donation. UNHCR's tireless efforts and second-to-none experience in assisting refugees, makes them an obvious choice to support as part of our $10 million USD in crypto donations.\" Binance Charity's donation comes at a time when the UNHCR is working with US government authorities in Ukraine, other UN agencies, local community groups and other partners to provide humanitarian assistance.

On Tuesday, the Singapore House of Commons passed legislation that would require all virtual asset service providers situated in the city-state to operate only after receiving a license from the authorities. The new regulation is included in the Financial Services and Markets Act. The measure strengthens the authority of the regulatory body, the Monetary Authority of Singapore. Only the aforementioned regulatory body would be allowed to provide licenses to crypto service providers. In the past, Singapore seemed to have a very lenient approach towards cryptocurrencies and other virtual digital assets. The city-state aimed toward becoming a hub for web3 innovation and in turn had lenient policies to attract start-ups and other companies working in the space. But it has been observed that the city-state is changing its approach towards cryptocurrency and other virtual digital assets. This decision by the Singaporean government is not an isolated example of its caution towards the cryptocurrency industry. Recently the city-state passed a law that would effectively prohibit crypto businesses from advertising to the general public, illustrating the country's cautious stance.

The Jetking Gold collection is priced at Rs 9,000 per NFT and the Jetking Premium collection is priced at Rs 40,000. The institute announced in a release that this initiative stems from their belief to promote tech inclusion.  Interestingly, blockchain-backed digital assets like NFTs are gaining popularity in recent times. NFTs or Non-Fungible Tokens represent digital ownership of assets and they use blockchain technology to provide an ownership certificate of said assets. Harsh Bharwani, CEO & MD, Jetking Infotrain said, “COVID-19 pandemic has accelerated the technology adoption all across the world and many industries have opted for different models to engage with consumers online as well as offline. The entry of blockchain is the strong base of crypto universe and a game changer. This will not in bring in transparency but also protect tampering of information. Since we teach about blockchain, we thought it apt to put our money where our mouth is and introduce a practical experience of using NFTs.” Also Read: Maharashtra's Gadchiroli to issue caste certificates via blockchain platform Polygon Also Read: Crypto crime: Pune police recovers over Rs 84 cr worth of Bitcoins ",

            "content": "Gary Gensler, the chairman of the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), stated on Monday that his agency intends to increase regulatory control of the cryptocurrency industry in order to safeguard investors from an assault of scams. Gensler made this statement virtually at the annual conference of the Penn Law Capital Markets Association. The SEC Chairman said that the American markets regulator intends to register and regulate crypto platforms, including working to separate asset custody to minimise risk. Gensler made a comparison between cryptocurrency platforms and alternative trading methods, which are employed in the stock and fixed income markets. The crucial distinction, he explained, is that the latter is predominantly utilised by institutional investors, whereas crypto platforms have ordinary clients. He clarified that the SEC will investigate whether cryptocurrency platforms should be treated more like retail exchanges.  Gensler also discussed the SEC's authority over stablecoins and crypto tokens. He stated that the $183 billion stablecoin market raises concerns, including the possibility of illicit activities. Crypto-to-crypto transactions, he explained, enable users to circumvent the regular banking system, making money laundering, taxes, and compliance more difficult to track. In conclusion, he noted that regulators have long had successful methods for regulating financial markets, and the emergence of new technology does not change much for the regulators and they would still play by their rules. Interestingly, Gensler’s remarks come weeks after US President Joe Biden signed an executive order directing the government to conduct an examination of the dangers and benefits of cryptocurrency.

            "content": "After Dubai and Singapore, the UK is gearing up to become a \"global hub\" for the cryptocurrency industry. The government has proposed new stablecoin regulations, a Royal Mint NFT, and a plethora of other measures to promote digital asset companies. In a Monday address, UK MP John Glen declared that the government was determined to demonstrate that the country is ready to welcome crypto businesses. The minister announced that the government would examine the potential of issuing government debt via distributed ledger technology, or blockchain. He claimed that chancellor Rishi Sunak, who is the son-in-law of Infosys founder Narayan Murthy, had commissioned the Royal Mint to create a non-fungible token (NFT) prior to the summer as a mark of the forward-thinking approach the country would take on the matter of Web3 and crypto. Additionally, the UK Treasury disclosed long-awaited plans to regulate stablecoin issuers and cryptocurrencies that match the value of traditional assets such as US dollars. It is interesting to note that previously UK politicians, especially Conservative MPs have had a negative stance on cryptocurrencies and other virtual digital assets in the UK. At the start of the year, the UK government had started a crackdown on false cryptocurrency promotions, subjecting them to the same regulation as traditional financial advertising. The UK's crypto push comes as countries like Dubai, Singapore, Thailand, etc. are coming up with lenient policies to attract Web3 start-ups and companies to their locations.

The funding round also witnessed participation from Arcanum Capital, a seed-stage VC firm focused on investments in decentralized protocols and applications for the global blockchain ecosystem. The start-up announced in a statement that the funds from this round would be used to solidify underlying technologies through research and development, and for team expansion.   Speaking about this latest development, Siddharth Banerjee, CEO of Kandola said, “With immense belief in the rapidly growing Web3 community, we hope to attract aspiring talent who will help us build Kandola ground up. We are already on course for a paradigm shift. Data being controlled and monetized by the owner is obvious and yet ambitious; any company working towards making this possible will be a part of an ongoing meta revolution.” Ragul Kumar, chief technology officer of Kandola said, “Kandola is building an IoT3 Network which will perform real-time transactions and finality at unprecedented scale for all non-DeFi business domains on Web3. We provide all actors with simple tools and mechanisms to participate in this decentralized network. We will deliver this value to IoT devices, manufacturers, and consumers as proof of our vision. We plan to expand this success to all businesses where there is a trust deficit between what is produced, processed, and delivered to consumers. Once in motion, we envision a steady power shift from centralized enterprises to the true owners, the value creators” Speaking about the funding, Tushar Behl from AlphaWave Global said, \"We are extremely excited to partner with Sid and his team at Kandola. We are big believers in the power of permaweb and decentralised infrastructure. At the same time, IoT and smart devices have taken over our world. Kandola has a real shot at building a critical piece of that infrastructure for one of the largest TAMs in human history!\" James McDowall from Arcanum Capital said, “The Kandola team brings a wealth of expertise and experience from the Web 2.0 IoT world and in our opinion have chosen the right time to innovate by applying Web 3.0 technologies to IoT. With a pre-existing client base and a solid vision of where the sector is evolving, Arcanum Capital is confident Kandola will become a leader in the field.” Also Read: Maharashtra's Gadchiroli to issue caste certificates via blockchain platform Polygon Also Read: Crypto crime: Pune police recovers over Rs 84 cr worth of Bitcoins ",

            "content": "During the Parliamentary proceedings on Monday, BJP MP from Vadodra, Ranjanben Dhananjay Bhatt sought clarity on the use of cryptocurrencies in drug trafficking and arms smuggling. The BJP MP from Vadodra asked the Ministry of Finance, “Whether it is a fact that there is increasing use of cryptocurrencies/virtual currencies for drug trafficking and arms smuggling in the country; if so, whether the Government proposes to take concrete steps to check it?\" Moreover, Bhatt also asked, “If so, the details thereof along with the time by which steps are likely to be taken by the Government in this regard; and if not, the reasons therefor?” Bhatt’s queries were answered by State Finance Minister Pankaj Chaudhary. Chaudhary responded by quoting cryptocurrency busts by the Narcotics Control Bureau, Central Board of Indirect Taxes, and Customs. The minister said, “Narcotics Control Bureau and Central Board of Indirect Taxes and Customs has unearthed the payment of approx. Rs. 2.2 crore through crypto-currency in 11 cases linked to drug trafficking.” Furthermore, he also explained the approach taken by the government to curb this menace. Chaudhary said, “Training for the field officers on cyber and forensic technologies,” as well as “on collection of evidences through electronic means.” Apart from the trading sessions, “regular liasioning with technical experts and coordination with foreign drug law enforcement agencies” is also on the list of measures taken by the government to tackle this issue.

            "content": "Cryptocurrency trade volumes on Indian exchanges have dropped following the implementation of the new crypto tax law. As per the provisions of the new tax law, a flat 30 per cent tax has been levied on all gains arising via virtual digital assets, including cryptocurrencies. Moreover, no deductions, set-offs or carry forwards are allowed. As per data from Nomics, a cryptocurrency data compiler, trading volumes on Indian crypto exchanges like CoinDCX, WazirX and ZebPay have seen a steep decline after April 1. The data compiled by Nomics showed that trading volumes on CoinDCX showed high peaks in the past week in the period between April 30 and April 31 and then showed a steep decline, as shown below. In the past week, as per data compiled by Nomics, cryptocurrency exchange WazirX also peaked in terms of trading volumes on April 30 and April 31, the last two days of the old tax provisions, wherein cryptocurrency profits were taxed as capital gains. Crypto exchange ZebPay observed a steep hike in trading volumes on April 31, the trade volumes fell considerably from April 1, as shown in the data below. It is also noteworthy to mention that similar data was shared by crypto influencer Aditya Singh, who goes by @CryptooAdy on Twitter.   — Aditya Singh (@CryptooAdy) April 2, 2022 Minal Thukral, SVP, Growth and Strategy at CoinDCX told Business Today that \"The trading volume was the highest on 31st March as users/ investors squared off their positions before the start of the new financial year. Starting April 1 there has been a decline, which is a usual trend at the start of every Financial year, however, this year we are seeing a sharper decline due to the stringent tax laws.\" Nischal Shetty, co-founder of WazirX exchange thinks it is still too soon to conclude the impact of the recently imposed taxation policy. He told Business Today, \"In the last two days, there has been a dip in trading volume across Indian exchanges. However, it’s still too soon to deem it as an effect of the recent amendments. We will have some idea by the second or third week of April on whether crypto taxes will impact the industry or people will still trade and not worry too much about the changes.\" Besides the 30 per cent tax on gains, India's Finance Minister had also announced that all digital-asset transactions surpassing a certain threshold would be subject to a 1% tax deducted at source, or TDS, beginning July 1.

In a release, OWN announced that it aims to build an NFT-based play-to-earn game. The organisation also announced that they plan on gamification of Defi as well. The brand aims at evolving into ‘Metaverse of Cryptos’ or a ‘Cryptoverse.’ OWN also announced in the release that they would decentralise the project eventually. This would enable the community members to actively contribute to the project. Akhil Gupta, founder of OWN said, “We are thrilled and exhilarated to have garnered the support that we needed to build on the future of OWN. To help people become more acquainted with the crypto ecosystem, we are personifying Cryptocurrencies. Imagine if Bitcoin, Ethereum, Solana, etc. were represented by a Warrior - Cryptonite. Where each Cryptonite has a backstory, aspiration, and a reason for existence. Each one of these Cryptonites will be sold as a unique NFT. Players can own these Cryptonites, play games, and earn high rewards in Cryptos!”. Speaking about the objective behind investing in OWN, Vaibhav from Better Capital said, “Currently web 3 technology is very new, and it is like the internet of the 90s. We would like to be the catalysts of growth for this rapidly growing industry and OWN is on a futuristic path of leveraging the web 3 tech and building consumer-centric use cases around gaming for Crypto markets. We would want to invest in a tech that will be the front runner for the NFT based play to earn games.” Also Read: Maharashtra's Gadchiroli to issue caste certificates via blockchain platform Polygon Also Read: Crypto crime: Pune police recovers over Rs 84 cr worth of Bitcoins ",

According to a statement released by Binance, Wad would be responsible for engineering scalable, compliant, and fast Web3 services and solutions. He would also be responsible for ensuring the continued security, stability, and liquidity of the exchange while meeting the evolving regulatory compliance requirements across regions where the platform is available. In addition, Wad would focus on significantly expanding the engineering team to accelerate the organisation’s progress.

Less than 10 percent of the addressable internet population owns crypto assets.

I am humbled to play a small part in providing financial freedom and supporting inclusion to billions of people.”  Rohit Wad, the new CTO of Binance said, “We are working on many Web3 experiences and solutions that will be transformative to billions of people, starting with the freedom of money.

            "content": "Global head of digital assets for Goldman Sachs' private wealth management division, Mary Catherine Rich, announced in an interview with CNBC that the financial service provider is gearing up to launch crypto investment services for its high-net-worth clients. Last week, the investment bank also announced it would be rolling out over-the-counter Bitcoin options. This came as a surprise to many as the bank had previously expressed its negative stance on cryptocurrencies. In 2020, the investment bank had released a 45-page long report, “US Economic Outlook & Implications of Current Policies for Inflation, Gold and Bitcoin”. The report claimed that despite their widespread use, cryptocurrencies are “not a type of asset.\" According to Goldman analysts, cryptocurrencies \"do not generate cash flow in the same way that bonds do\" and do not profit from \"exposure to global economic development.\" Interestingly, the other leading financial service provider Morgan Stanley also had similar views about crypto but has now warmed up to crypto and Web3.  Morgan Stanley became the first bank to open its branch in Decentraland Metaverse. The adoption of cryptocurrencies and digital assets by giants like Goldman Sachs and Morgan Stanley has pushed wider adoption of cryptocurrencies and is one of the reasons that caused the recent bull run. It would be interesting to see how the interest of institutional investors in crypto and other digital assets pans out in the near future.

            "header": "Top 13 types of NFTs: Here's the complete list",
            "content": "Non-fungible tokens or NFTs have taken the world by storm. They are the newest digital-asset trend which has boomed in the year 2021 and Bollywood actors like Amitabh Bachchan and Salman Khan have also capitalised on this latest movement by launching their own NFT collections.  They might seem complex, especially because of the technical jargon involved in explaining them, but in layman's terms, they are a unique and non-interchangeable unit of data stored on the blockchain, which is a type of digital ledger, and the owner of the NFT gets a proof of ownership certificate from the digital ledger. Not so complex now, is it?  NFTs are usually associated with non-physical art but in reality, there are several different types of NFTs and are explained in this guide.  1. Artworks  As already stated, this is the most popular category of NFTs out there. These are mainly digital artworks that come with a public certificate of authenticity and ownership issued by the digital ledger on which they are stored. The most expensive NFT sold is the digital artwork 'The First 5000 Days' by artist Beeple for a whopping $69.3 million in March 2021 in a Christie's auction.  2.  Collectibles Collectibles are the first type of NFTs to be ever launched. They are the same as physical collectibles, like Pokemon cards or vintage mint condition toys but in digital form. Curio Cards were the first major NFT collectibles ever launched after which several other collectibles like Bored Ape Yacht Club, Cryptopunks, Cat Colony, Meebits, etc. have taken off. They are a collector's delight and Bored Ape Yacht Club has turned out to be the most valuable digital collectibles out there. \n \n3. Sports Memorabilia  Sports Memorabilia is one of the hottest NFT categories and the most famous NFT of this segment is the NBA Top Shot. This type of NFT usually includes a video clip of memorable sports moments. One of the most famous NFTS in this category is The LeBron James Dunk, Throwdowns (Series) which is a clip of Lakers player LeBron James dunking the ball. It sold for over $380,000 and is one of the most expensive Sports Memorabilia NFTs ever.  4. Video-Game Assets  These are NFT-based video games that players get involved in to win rewards like cryptocurrency, digital assets, or other NFTs. The very first NFT video-game asset was the game Axie Infinity after which games like CryptoKitties, Gods Unchained, Sorare, etc became very popular amongst video game players.  5. Virtual Land  This includes land in video games as well as in the Metaverse. It might seem like an extremely redundant asset with no real-world applications but it has great potential. The virtual piece of land can be used to place advertisements inside video games, create virtual assets, etc.  6. Memes  A few years ago, no one could imagine that memes could have any financial value attached to them, but amidst the NFT wave, memes have also become a valuable digital asset. The original Doge meme sold for $4 million in June 2021. Memes like Disaster Girl, Bad Luck Brian, Success Kid, NyanCat, etc have also been valued significantly and have been sold for a fortune making the meme creators wealthy and the meme market lucrative. The meme of disaster girl sold for over $470,000.  7. Domain Names  These are crypto domains minted on a blockchain, for example on Binance Smart Chain or Ethereum. They have over 500 domain extensions, the most sought-after of which is '.eth'. Crypto domains do not depend on any centralised authority and hence are a coveted asset. Moreover, they can also be used to link crypto-wallets which is not a feature in non-NFT domain names. The biggest shortcoming of Cryptodomains is the fact that a majority of browsers do not support them as of now.  8. Music  This is one of the newest phenomena in NFT mania. Artists pre-release their albums on NFT marketplaces before releasing them on traditional streaming platforms and buyers can buy a part of the album, like say a share in it, and then when the album is released via traditional channels, the buyers get to have a share in the profits of the album. This business model is not yet an established way of trading in Musical NFTs but a considerable number of transactions follow this pattern. For example, Kings of Leon's album 'When You See Yourself'  was sold as multiple NFTs in a similar manner in March 2021.  9. Ticketing  The onset of NFTs has introduced various innovations in the way day-to-day transactions take place and ticketing has not been left behind. Tickets for events can be minted now on blockchain platforms and then can be auctioned off by the organisers. NFT tickets can also be sold at a fixed price. This would significantly reduce forgeries and add a sense of memorabilia because these tickets can also be stored and resold as collectibles.  10. Real World Assets  Up till this point, you might be wondering that NFTs are only associated with digital and virtual assets. But NFTs have applications related to real world assets as well. A Real World asset NFT (rwANFt) is a token that signifies virtual ownership of a physical object. Just like digital NFTs, the token attached to a rwANFT proves ownership as well as establishes legal contracts of warranty, insurance, enforceability, etc. rwANFTs have an extra layer of security since the tokens cannot be forged and the digital ledger provides transparency to prevent frauds. \n  \n11. NFT Fashion  Sounds bonkers, right? Virtual fashion, how could that even be a thing? Well, brace yourself because it is very real and has significant market capitalisation. Virtual fashion includes clothing and accessories made for digital avatars and video game characters. Louis Vuitton and Burberry have come out with a line of NFT fashion including kimonos and sneakers for digital avatars.  12. Identity  NFTs have started gaining significant real-world traction because of their non-fungibility and the added assurance of transparency from the digital ledger. One of the real-world applications of NFTs is in providing identification certificates to individuals. Self-Sovereign Identity and Bridge Protocols are some of the examples of real-world utilisation of NFTs in individual Id-ing.  13. Miscellaneous Online Items  This category includes anything and everything which has not been covered in the former categories. This includes tweets, blogs, Instagram posts, etc. In other words, anything that has been minted on a digital ledger and has non-fungibility falls under this category. For example, Jack Dorsey's first tweet was sold for $2.9 million.  In conclusion, NFTs are broadly associated with digital as well as virtual assets but, with the recent leaps in technology, newer real-world applications of NFTs have also been created to make transactions more transparent and secure.

            "content": "Indonesia plans to charge value-added tax (VAT) on crypto asset transactions and an income tax on capital gains from such investments at 0.1% each, starting from May 1, a tax official said on Friday, amid a boom in digital asset trading. Interest in digital assets has surged in Southeast Asia's largest economy during the COVID-19 pandemic, with the number of crypto asset holders jumping to 11 million by the end of 2021. Last year's total crypto asset transactions in commodity futures markets reached 859.4 trillion rupiah ($59.8 billion), up more than 10 times from 2020's transaction value, data from the Commodity Futures Trading Regulatory Agency showed. Indonesians are allowed to trade crypto assets as a commodity but not to use them as a means of payment. \"Crypto assets will be subject to VAT because they are a commodity as defined by the trade ministry. They are not a currency,\" the official, Hestu Yoga Saksama, told a media briefing. \"So we will impose income tax and VAT.\" The government is still working on the implementing regulation for the taxes, he added. The VAT rate on crypto assets is well below the 11% levied on most Indonesian goods and services, while the income tax on capital gains, at 0.1% of gross transaction value, matches that on shares. Officials said a wide-ranging tax law passed last year was the legal basis for taxes on crypto assets. That law aimed to optimise revenue collection hit by the aftermath of the COVID-19 pandemic.

            "content": "Gita Gopinath, the Deputy Managing Director and former Chief Economist of IMF said that the sanctions placed on Russia in light of the ongoing war would reduce the dollar dominance and promote other currencies like crypto. The top IMF official, in a recent interview with Financial Times, said, “Unprecedented financial sanctions imposed on Russia after its Ukraine invasion are gradually diluting the US dollar’s dominance, which might fragment the international monetary system,” further adding “Sanctions could encourage the emergence of small currency blocs based on trade between separate groups of countries.” The deputy managing director of IMF also said that the war would also spur the adoption of digital finance, from cryptocurrencies to stablecoins and central bank digital currencies. She said that this would lead to the promotion of cryptocurrencies but mentioned that a  “comprehensive, consistent, and coordinated” plan for capitalizing on the benefits of cryptocurrencies is still the need of the hour. Gopinath further reasoned that the escalating conflict between Russia and Ukraine has cleared the path for the disintegration of the global financial system.

Here is all you need to know about the new tax regime. Flat 30 per cent tax on Gains All gains derived on sale of virtual digital assets, or VDAs, which includes cryptocurrencies, would be taxed at a rate of 30 per cent. There is no threshold under which taxes would not be levied. 1 per cent TDS A 1 per cent TDS would be deducted on all cryptocurrency transactions, irrespective of profit or loss. It is noteworthy to mention that in case of loss, the taxpayer would be provided with a refund on the TDS paid. Also, the provisions relating to TDS would be applicable from July 1. Set offs Under the new tax policy, no set offs of crypto losses would be available. Taxpayers would not be able to set off their profits incurred on cryptocurrencies with any kinds of losses, be it between two crypto assets or any other asset and crypto assets. Carry forwards Under the new tax policy, carry forward of losses is not allowed.  Tax payers would not have the option to carry forward their crypto losses to the next financial year. Deductions Under the new taxation policy, no deductions, including cost of acquisition, etc., would be allowed in the case of virtual digital assets, which would include cryptocurrencies. This also includes cost of mining cryptocurrencies. Most of these provisions kick in from today. The provision for TDS kicks in from July 1.

            "content": "Blockchain is decentralised and is designed to be immutable. The records stored in a blockchain cannot be altered, which can be of huge benefit to permanently store transactions related to property, land, stocks, among other things. This is the reason experts swear by the potential of blockchain technology when it comes to innovation.   “Blockchain will have the same profound impact emails had to the workplace when it was first introduced. It is a very impactful technology with immense potential. It is paving the way for more efficient, transparent, and less bureaucratic digital financial systems. While crypto assets have an underlying utility and benefits, we are still at a nascent stage of this revolution,” said Manhar Garegrat, Executive Director-Policy and Special Projects, at CoinDCX.  However, the recent 30 per cent crypto tax, which is applicable from today, i.e April 1, 2022, has made many people wonder about the future of blockchain technology in the country. Though the government has time and again emphasised the benefits of harnessing this new age technology, can the technology develop without crypto-friendly regulations?  Can crypto tax derail the growth of blockchain technology?  “In order to continue building and innovating in this field, crypto-friendly regulations are extremely important. Lack of it is extremely demotivating for investors as well as innovators and increases the chances of talent moving out thereby hampering India’s chances of being a leader in this revolution,” said Garegrat.  Are crypto and blockchain interconnected? Blockchain technology is the underlying technology for crypto but it has many use cases apart from crypto too, where it can be used to develop permissioned blockchains that can be used for enterprises and government in several ways.   “Definitely, the blockchain technology and the cryptocurrency are interconnected as crypto is powered by the blockchain technology itself. However, the applications of blockchain tech goes much beyond only cryptocurrencies; the same technology can be used for smart contracts, real estate, governance and voting, art monetisation and NFTs, to name a few. Blockchain technology aims to decentralise the existing financial system where the control moves from the intermediaries to the ones engaging between the information/data exchange. Maybe, that doesn’t bode well with the government, who is possibly fearing the misuse of this technology as the reason to impose stringent taxes and regulations. Ironically, the same technology has been designed to clear the clutter that has been caused within and by the existing financial system,” explains Om Malviya, President, Tezos India.  Vikram Subburaj, CEO of Giottus Cryptocurrency Exchange adds, “Crypto is a manifestation of blockchain technology in the public domain. Currently, all use cases of blockchain necessitates the exchange of an associated crypto asset. This includes transactions, governance, payment options, DeFi initiatives and well as the metaverse.” He explains that private blockchains do not necessarily need cryptos to work on blockchains as they work on the system of tokenisation. While for public blockchains one needs to have cryptos.   There are essentially two types of blockchains: public and private. Public blockchains are 100 per cent permission-less, which means that anyone can participate within the blockchain and can join the network. Experts say that the large-scale adoption of public blockchain can drive greater financial inclusion, data ownership and frictionless processes at the inter- and intra-organisational levels.   “The blockchain mechanism is focused on the consensus of a digital asset and the storage of data in a decentralised environment. When it comes to public and private blockchains, some experts believe that public blockchain requires cryptocurrency to work while private blockchains don't. Public blockchains are decentralised and distributed. Every new block needs validation across all the computers connected to the nodes or network before they can be added to the blockchain. Due to this reason, public blockchains are immutable, meaning a record added can neither be edited nor deleted. On the contrary, private blockchains are invitation-only networks managed by one entity. They don't have decentralisation. This is an essential component of blockchains. Many experts also argue that they are not blockchains but centralised databases using distributed ledger technology,” points out Pratik Gauri, co-founder and CEO, 5ire, which is a blockchain network company.  Is talent oultflow happening? There is a general perception that higher taxes would force the industry to leave the country. Some people also believe that this could prompt the industry to operate underground and move innovative ideas to foreign countries.  “Even though profits from trading crypto would be taxed at 30 per cent, losses can't be set off against other losses and cannot be carried forward. Compared with any asset or business, the crypto industry also experiences bull and bear runs. A trader could lose money in a bear market and hope to recover his investment during the bull run. Carrying forward losses will also reduce the investor's tax burden in the long run. The government does allow shares investors to carry forward their losses. The same liberty should also be provided to the crypto traders if they incur any losses,” argued Gauri.  “While many developed countries are moving towards adopting cryptocurrencies under a regulatory framework, India is still in the deliberation stage. This will hurt India’s ability to gain leadership in blockchain technology. Without a functional and thriving investor ecosystem in crypto assets, blockchain based companies will not be incentivised to set shop in India which will dampen the prospects of job creation as well as in enabling,” said Giottus' Subburaj. Crypto is a new and upcoming industry. For, Garegrat, those working in the crypto and blockchain industries are encountering new problems and coming up with new solutions every day.  “There are risks and challenges in terms of technology, safety, compliance - to name a few - but we’re certainly making progress when it comes to finding solutions. Every new technology comes with its fair share of risks and challenges. But shutting out isn’t the solution. Building compliant and safe solutions is what we must focus on. Adopting these new technologies is important and will prove to be good for the economy.”  ",

Multinational fintech firm, FIS said in a statement that under the prevailing laws, crypto as an asset class has become less attractive in India. The company said that many small investors would have offloaded their portfolios by March 31, however some big investors may still continue trading. “Crypto as an asset class has definitely become less attractive and there is a broad consensus that current holders and investors would sell, given the tax regime announced for virtual digital assets. However, HNW investors who are already in the 30 per cent tax bracket may look at this scenario a little differently especially if they are betting on windfall gains on the back of how large crypto markets recognize and regulate crypto during FY22,” Harish Prasad, Head of Banking at FIS said in a statement. Prasad added that there is a growing segment of holders who acquire crypto by virtue of participating in the Web3 digital economy, and they need to device strategies for the long term on how they manage their crypto holdings. “India’s movement in the crypto market have largely been factored by global markets in my view, and the moves of the global market will now depend on global dynamics around demand and how large global markets regulate crypto,” he noted. The crypto industry stakeholders had raised concerns that the new tax rules will be a big blow to the sector and may impact the trading activity on homegrown platforms with the small investors preferring overseas exchanges where 1 per cent TDS will not be implemented. The new rules include 30 per cent tax on the transfer of virtual digital assets, in addition to 1 percent TDS for every transaction. Besides, the government has not allowed offsetting the losses against the profits on other VDAs and no tax deducted for crypto mining.   ",

            "content": "Ariel India has announced their foray into the NFT space on Thursday. To amplify the conversation around equality in the division of household chores and pave the way for more authentic, accurate, and equal representation in pop-culture imagery, the brand has partnered with five women contemporary artists to develop Non Fungible Tokens(NFTs). This initiative is under the #ShareTheLoad and #SeeEqual campaigns by the organization to promote household equality. Artists Vanora Vaz, Yashika Kalra, Rachna Ravi, Amoolya Bhat, and Virti Jain have come together to create digital artworks that can be positive reaffirmations to inspire change and equality. It is interesting to note that these NFTs would not be sold but would be available as prizes. The contest for the same would be announced soon on the brand’s social media pages.  Sharat Verma, Chief Marketing Officer, P&G India and Vice President, Fabric Care, P&G India said the following about the campaign in a release, “The launch of these limited-edition NFT artworks is yet another attempt in the same direction. Our partnership with like-minded artists to launch this NFT collection can promote imagery that can help us #SeeEqual, both in the real and virtual worlds.” Ariel has been advocating for equality for the last seven years with the #ShareTheLaod movement. This year, the conversation is being carried forward by going deeper to understand what is coming in the way of equality and highlighting the impact of unconscious biases. ",

            "content": "The Pune Police Department has recovered 237 Bitcoins taken by two cyber specialists who were arrested in 2018 for stealing cryptocurrency while assisting authorities in the GainBitcoin scam.  Earlier this month, the Pune police's cybercrime division detained two specialists, Pankaj Ghode and Ravindranath Patil as well as an ex-IPS officer from the Jammu and Kashmir cadre, following an exhaustive investigation that began in April 2021. In 2018, Ghode and Patil aided a Pune police Special Investigations squad in uncovering the GainBitcoin crypto scam. Ghode and Patil had transferred a substantial amount of cryptocurrency assets to their own cryptocurrency wallets. The two are charged with faking screenshots of cryptocurrency wallets in order to launder money. With the cooperation of Ghode and Patil, the Pune police seized 241.46 Bitcoins, 452 Bitcoin cash units, and 94 Ethereum units from the 17 suspects arrested in the 2018 case. The 237 Bitcoins were discovered in crypto wallets linked to Ravindranath Patil. GainBitcoin was a multi-level marketing scheme that took Bitcoin deposits and promised 10 per cent returns, in Bitcoin. But the investors were not paid back in Bitcoin but in a token called MCAP, which was created by the promoters of the fraud. Currently, Bitcoin is trading at 35,76,630 as of 14:00 IST as per CoinMarketCap data, which means the recovered bitcoins are worth 84,88,88,259.00 as per recent exchange rates.

            "content": "The new financial year is set to bring a slew of changes in income tax rules. It is better to be prepared in advance so that you can plan your savings as well as spending, accordingly. Here are the key tax provisions that become applicable from April 1,2022. Crypto Tax The Finance Bill 2022, as passed by the Lok Sabha, has inserted a new section 115BBH to provide the method of computation and the tax rate for the income arising from the transfer of Virtual Digital Asset (VDA). Now, according to the new rules, gains from all virtual digital assets including cryptos will be taxable at 30 per cent, and it will apply even if your taxable income is below Rs 2,50,000.   “From April 1, 2022, income from transfer of virtual digital assets is taxable at 30 per cent. Such income will be taxable even the taxpayers' total income is below the threshold limit of Rs 2,50,000. Further, no deduction other than cost of acquisition is allowed while computing the taxable amount,” said Neeraj Agarwala, Partner, Nangia Andersen LLP.  Moreover, there will be no provision for setting off and carrying forward of unclaimed losses. This means that losses made from Dogecoin cannot be set off against profits earned from Bitcoin or any other VDA. The high tax provisions are likely wane off the interest in the crypto market which otherwise have given very high return over the last few years.  Updated ITR Taxpayers will now be able to file updated income tax return within two years from the end of the relevant assessment year. “In the event, a taxpayer has omitted to report certain income, such persons will now have an opportunity to voluntarily disclose such income by filing an updated tax return with additional tax calculated based on the delay,” said Agarwala.  Relief on long term capital gains  Earlier income from long term capital gains arising in the hands of individuals from the transfer of assets other than listed securities was subject to a surcharge at 37 per cent of income tax. “From April 1, 2022, surcharge on such gains has been brought at par with the surcharge applicable in case of other capital gains at 15 per cent and accordingly, marginal relief will be available in their hands,” said Agarwala.  No additional deduction u/s 80EEA The deduction under Section 80EEA is available only for houses purchased before March 31, 2022. So, if you are planning to buy a house in the next financial year do remember that the additional deduction of Rs. 1.5 lakh against the payment of interest on home loan will not be provided. Section 80EEA is available for first time home buyers where stamp duty value of the property does not exceed Rs 45 lakhs.   The EMI on home loan comprises of principal and interest. You can avail tax benefit for both. Firstly, the principal component of EMI paid in the year can be claimed as deduction under section 80C of the Income Tax Act. The maximum limit is Rs 1.5 lakh. Secondly, you can avail interest deduction under section 24B of income tax act to the extent of Rs 2 lakh. This limit of Rs 2 lakh is for self-occupied property.   Two EPF accounts Now from April 1 your provident fund (PF) accounts will be divided into two parts taxable and non-taxable account. This is because in the Budget 2021 the finance minister said that contributions made in excess of Rs 2.5 lakh annually will be taxable.   The income earned in the current year gets taxed in the hands of the employee next year. So, the interest earned in your EPF account will get taxed in 2022-23, only if the contribution is above Rs 2.5 lakh. Moreover, tax will be levied only on the interest earned on the amount exceeding Rs 2.5 lakh. The contribution amount does not become taxable.   TDS on property TDS of 1 per cent is applicable on transfer of immovable property above Rs 50 lakh. The TDS was deducted on consideration paid. “From April 1, 2022, TDS of 1 per cent shall be deducted on consideration or stamp duty value, whichever is higher. The said amendment is undertaken in line with the provisions of section 43CA and 50C which state that the consideration should not be less than the stamp duty value,” said Agarwala.  80DD for differently-abled children  Conditions for availing tax benefits on the insurance policy for differently-abled children have been relaxed. Previously, expenses incurred on premium payments could be claimed as deductions, under section 80DD of the Income Tax Act, only if the payout is made to a differently-abled child after the death of a parent or caregiver. Now, from April 1 this has been relaxed to extend the deduction even if the sum is received while the parent is still alive or when they attain 60 years of age.

Pharmaceutical firm OctaPharma Plasma, based out of the US, has announced that it has teamed up with Swan Bitcoin and Spade Payment Solutions to enable Bitcoin reimbursement for plasma donations. According to a release, the firm announced that they would pay plasma donors $100 in Bitcoin for donating plasma. The pilot has been launched at 32 locations.  Donors can donate plasma as frequently as 2 times in 7 days, with at least 48 hours between donations under the pilot program. The firm announced that users can earn over $10,000 by donating twice each week. Donors need to be at least 18 years of age. People with chronic diseases and co morbidities are advised against participating in the program. Experts believe that this would help increasing plasma donations and will also incentivise people to be donors. Rare, chronic, and inherited illnesses are treated with plasma donations, and immunocompromised patients rely on monthly plasma transfusions despite dwindling supplies. Swan Bitcoin, a collaborator on this project, allows customers to instantly receive and acquire Bitcoin. On the other hand, Spade Payment Solutions, the third collaborator on this project, specialises in Bitcoin integration for non-profits.

Fans of the KGF movie series starring actor Yash would be able to explore the ‘KGFverse” with distinct avatars. The sale of the KGFVerse avatars would go live on April 7. KGFverse would be a digital avatar-based metaverse and would be dedicated to the fans of the KGF film series. The broader aim of this project would be to let the fans of the series build a slew of games and virtual environments to facilitate the movement of KGF in the Web3 powered metaverse.  KGF fans would gain access to the KGFverse chapter by owning the token of the El-Dorado book. It is noteworthy to mention that the KGF film series is based on the aforementioned book. The token would grant memberships of the KGF club to the owners of the token. The club membership would grant the users access to various avatars, props, and land parcels of the movie in the form of NFTs. Vijay Kiragandur, founder of Hombale Films said the following about this new initiative “Metaverse is the new frontier of the Internet and an innovative way to engage with audiences and movie fans. It is the future of virtual hangouts and a new way of consuming content, and therefore, we are exploring this space to enable our fans to interact with elements of both chapters of KGF in the metaverse.\" Releasing nationwide on April 14, in Kannada, Telugu, Hindi, Tamil, and Malayalam, ‘KGF: Chapter 2’ is written and directed by Prashanth Neel, one of the most sought-after directors, and produced by Vijay Kiragandur under the Hombale Films banner.  It is interesting to note that this is not the first time a movie has taken to the metaverse for promotion. Earlier this month, Radhe Shyam, starring actor Prabhas and Pooja Hegde, had its trailer launch in the metaverse.

            "content": "UniFarm, a group staking platform, announced on Monday the acquisition of asset-backed NFT platform ‘OpenDeFi’ to access a wider audience catering to both NFT and the crypto ecosystem. UniFarm is a platform that allows users to stake different tokens and provides various DeFi projects in a single space. The platform has a native token, $UFARM.   OpenDeFi is a platform that encourages tokenisation of real-world assets, providing financial services in a decentralized mechanism, and also enables community-based development of early-stage DeFi projects through DAO ecosystem. The native token of the platform is $ORO. In a release, the platform announced that via this acquisition, it aims at creating a wider ecosystem that caters to the strengths of both platforms all in one place. UniFarm intends to introduce asset-backed group NFTs.   They further clarified in a statement that the utility tokens of both the platforms would merge into one with $UFARM being the sole utility token. $ORO holders would be able to claim $UFARM token at UniFarm’s website.   Commenting on the acquisition, Mohit Madan, CEO and Founder of UniFarm said, “Both UniFarm and OpenDeFi have a common objective of wealth creation but into different spheres. Reminiscing our journey and how far we have come from launching our first cohort in 2021 to successfully launching 36 cohorts across BSC, Polygon, ETH and AVAX with $100 Million + staked so far. Not just that, we have also come up with our own launchpad ‘UNIFARM Launch for the upcoming and most promising IDO launches.”    Adding further, Tarusha Mittal, COO and co-founder of UniFarm said, “This merger will absorb $ORO into $UFARM creating a larger utility for our users and improved capture of value. We wish to make UniFarm a one-stop solution for all things Crypto, NFT and metaverse.” Also Read: US GDP accelerates in fourth quarter; corporate profits slow Also Read: Adani Wilmar stock zooms 133% in 2 months; is it still a good buy?

            "content": "In keeping with the times, Etapalli, a subdivision of district Gadchiroli in Maharashtra, will issue caste certificates to its 65,000 residents via LegitDoc — a polygon public blockchain-based platform. Assistant collector Shubham Gupta announced via a Linkedin post on Monday that the Gadchiroli administration would be issuing caste certificates which will be cryptographically anchored on polygon blockchain via the LegitDoc platform.  This will enable entities to instantly authenticate the certificates with the help of uncensorable, publicly auditable data stored on the public blockchain. The bureaucrat also wrote a post on this initiative on LinkedIn in which he highlighted the fact that the Etapalli sub-division comprises villages from Etapalli and Bhamragad. These villages have a large tribal population and frequently require caste certificates to avail of government-funded benefits and subsidies. He also wrote that the majority of the population in the area hold their caste certificates in paper printouts for convenience but, as it turns out, these documents are challenging to authenticate and verify. Gupta clarified that the proposed blockchain system would cryptographically commit selective details of every caste certificate fetched from the ‘MahaOnline’ portal on the polygon blockchain and generates a unique QR code consisting of blockchain proofs that will be embedded on each caste certificate. Furthermore, these certificates will be issued via common service centres (CSC), which are currently operational across all villages. Subsequently, the open verification system would be available on the government website and enable government departments or any other third parties to verify the authenticity of a certificate with the click of a button. Gupta also said that “In addition to supporting the state administration to curb the menace of forgeries, and along with identifying the right beneficiaries for delivery of government schemes/benefits, such an implementation sets a precedent for India to emerge as the frontier in building tech stacks on neutral web3 platforms- decentralization-aligned, deplatformation-resistant alternatives to the censorship-prone US and Chinese dominated digital tech stacks. ” Also Read: Dubai looks to become the crypto capital of the world Also Read: BJP MP suggests increasing tax rate on crypto during parliament session ",

            "content": "Ronin Network, Axie Infinity’s crypto gaming platform, announced on Tuesday in a blog post published by the Ronin Network's official Substack, that more than $625 million in USDC and ether (ETH) had been hacked from their network last week, making it the largest reported crypto hack till date. Ronin Network, a blockchain network, is an Ethereum sidechain built specifically for Axie Infinity. Axie Infinity is a popular crypto game that rewards its players with crypto tokens. The blog clarified that the hack exploited the Ronin Network validator nodes for Sky Mavis, the producers of the popular Axie Infinity game, and the Axie DAO. The losses totaled 173,600 ether and 25.5 million USDC, which is valued at over $625 million, as per the blog. The blog stated that the hacker used hacked private keys in order to forge fake withdrawals. As per data from Etherscan, the Ethereum address used by the Ronin attacker is a new one and was created one week ago after receiving ETH from the Binance exchange. The attacker's address retains the majority of the funds. After the attack, both the Ronin Bridge and the Katana automated market maker (AMM) have been suspended pending the outcome of the investigation. The price of RON, the Ronin network's native token, has fallen by 21 per cent as of 13:00 IST, CoinMarketCap data showed. Experts blamed the fact that only five validator nodes had to be commandeered out of the nine validator nodes to complete the hack. On this subject, Flora Li, Head of Huobi Research Institute, commented, “This hack reflects the continuing challenges that blockchains and operators face in balancing user experience and security. Axie Infinity exploded in popularity and saw a rapid influx in users on the Ronin blockchain. They took shortcuts to relieve network bottlenecks, cutting down the number of nodes that needed to be validated for transactions to just five of nine nodes, making it easier for hackers to exploit,”  “While Sky Mavis has pledged to raise the number of required nodes to eight, it still doesn’t solve the fundamental problem of how proof-of-stake blockchains can keep transactions fast, user-friendly, and energy-efficient without compromising security,” she further added. In response to the hack, the Ronin blockchain network has increased the validator threshold from five to eight.

Chaturvedi started her address by pointing out the fact that the government has not provided any clarity on the legal status of cryptocurrencies in India, yet they have introduced a flat 30 per cent tax and TDS on cryptocurrencies.  The Shivsena MP went on to say that the government does not understand cryptocurrency and Web3 and hence has taken an antagonistic stance on it. She further added that this happened in the past too when the Internet was booming. The government of India was unable to provide an enabling ecosystem for Indian talent, and hence missed out on innovation. The member of Parliament concluded her speech by saying “We are living in the world of web 3.0, either we choose to bite the bullet or we dodge the bullet.” The crypto community appreciated the MP’s address and commended her for taking a stance against the regressive approach the Government of India has opted for. Sumit Gupta, CEO of CoinDCX expressed his appreciation in a tweet. Kashif Raza, crypto educator and influencer also commended the MP for her stance in a Tweet. Nischal Shetty, co-founder of WazirX also took to Twitter to show his support.

            "content": "Cryptocurrency exchange Giottus announced on Tuesday that they would be introducing a zero-fee window from March 30 to April 2, 2022, to reduce the burden on investors ahead of the new crypto tax regime that kicks in from April 1, 2022. The crypto exchange announced in a release that investors would be able to make unlimited trades with INR pairs without paying any fees during the four-day window. It is noteworthy to mention that the fees of crypto-crypto trades would continue to be at the prevailing rates. A flat 30 per cent tax on crypto gains and 1 per cent TDS has been imposed on Indian crypto investors, starting from April 1, 2022. Many industry insiders and experts believe that the new tax regime is expected to present crypto investors with a disadvantage. Apart from the blanket tax rate and TDS, crypto investors would not be able to set off or carry forward their losses. Moreover, investors would not be able to claim deductions of any sort to reduce their tax burden. Many have called the new tax regime “regressive ” and “detrimental”. Concerns have been raised about the fact that the tax regime and strict regulations would promote peer to peer markets more and give rise to a crypto grey market. The excessively harsh regulations would drive away customers from KYC compliant crypto exchanges. Furthermore, concerns are also being raised that the regulations might cause 'brain drain', with promising talent moving to other countries to promote the Web3 innovation there.

            "content": "Lionel Messi has signed an agreement worth more than $20 million to promote digital fan token company Socios.com, a source close to the deal told Reuters on Tuesday. Messi becomes the latest global sports personality to enter the crypto world following NFL quarterback Tom Brady and NBA star LeBron James and the deal is part of a growing wave of tie-ups between crypto firms and soccer. Socios said in a news release that Paris St Germain and Argentina forward Messi, whose move from Barcelona in August included a cryptocurrency payment, will be involved in a publicity and promotion campaign for Socios in the build-up to the Qatar World Cup, which starts in November. The 'ambassador' deal for Messi does not include crypto payments and is a three-year agreement, the source said. Socios have signed deals, including creating tokens, for over 130 sports organisations including a number of top soccer clubs such as PSG, Barcelona, Juventus and Manchester City. Fan tokens are a type of cryptocurrency that allow holders to vote on mostly minor decisions related to their clubs. \"Fans deserve to be recognised for their support. They deserve opportunities to influence the teams they love,\" Messi said in the statement. “Socios.com exists to enhance the fan experience, to enable fans to ‘be more’. I’m proud to join Socios.com’s mission to create a more connected and rewarding future for fans around the world.” The tokens are increasingly seen by clubs as a source of new revenue but have been criticised by some supporters groups who see their introduction as superficial participation that adds to the already growing costs of following their teams. Brady last year took an undisclosed equity stake in crypto exchange platform FTX Trading Ltd and became an ambassador for the company. In January, James announced a multi-year partnership with Crypto.com, a company who recently signed a sponsorship deal with world soccer's governing body FIFA. ",

Previously, global crypto exchanges like FTX and Binance had received licenses to operate in the city, as reported by Business Today. Dubai's ruler, Sheikh Mohammed Bin Rashid announced earlier this month that the emirate had enacted its first law governing virtual assets and had also formed an independent regulator to regulate the cryptocurrency sector. The Dubai Virtual Asset Regulation Law was introduced to develop Dubai and the UAE as regional and global destinations for the crypto market players. The Dubai Virtual Assets Regulatory Authority (VARA), a regulatory body, will oversee the development of the virtual asset business environment in terms of regulation, licensing, and governance. As regional economic competition heats up, Dubai has been encouraging the growth of the crypto sector by creating a regulatory environment to attract crypto businesses and talent to the city.

            "content": "Sushil Kumar Modi, BJP MP from Bihar, suggested during parliamentary proceedings on Monday that the government should plan on raising the proposed tax rate on cryptocurrency earnings from 30 per cent, claiming that cryptocurrency trading is similar to gambling.  As per Modi’s speech in the parliament, cryptocurrencies have no intrinsic value and cannot be categorised as a commodity, or asset, or good, or service. He further said that cryptocurrencies are like gambling because of a lack of central authority that would regulate cryptocurrencies. The MP went on to say that the 18 per cent goods and services tax (GST) should be extended to crypto service providers such as exchanges Modi went on to give instances of countries that have higher cryptocurrency taxes than India. He said, “Japan taxes cryptocurrencies at a rate of 55 per cent, while Germany, France, and Australia tax at up to 45 per cent. The USA has 37 per cent taxes on crypto.” He further suggested to the Finance Minister that cryptocurrencies should be taxed at higher rates in the future. It is noteworthy to mention that in Japan the 55 per cent taxation on crypto is not a blanket rate for all profits on crypto, but is only for certain tax brackets. Moreover, in Germany, the 45 per cent tax on crypto is on short-term crypto gains beyond 600 euros annually, that too only for certain tax brackets.  In France, the 45 per cent tax on crypto is for professional traders and miners, that too on gains above 305 euros annually. Furthermore, in Australia, crypto-assets acquired for less than $10,000 are exempted from taxes, and the rates are different for different tax brackets. Finally, the 37 per cent taxes on crypto in USA are only applicable for short term capital gains, that too only on the highest tax bracket. Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman put forth flat 30 per cent taxes on gains and one per cent TDS on cryptocurrencies in India during the Union Budget 2022.  ",

            "content": "As a bleak first quarter draws to a close, crypto seems to have the wind in its sails. It has pushed through the $2 trillion barrier and is proving surprisingly resilient amid global chaos. At Monday's high of $47,765, market leader bitcoin broke above the narrow $34,000-$44,000 range it's traded in for most of 2022. Through a steady grind higher from a low just above $40,000 on March 21, it has gained 18%. Its comparative steadiness, versus previous performance at least, contrasts with stock markets, traditional currencies and even safe-haven gold, which have been shaken by the Russian invasion of Ukraine as well as the Federal Reserve's tightening. Bitcoin's jumpiness has waned of late. Its 30-day volatility is around 4%, about two-thirds the level it was in June 2021, according to futures trading platform Coinglass. The highest this year was 4.56% on March 16. This measures its deviation from its own standard levels, and bitcoin has still had wild swings, such as a 17% jump on March 1. But it's distinctly tamer than in 2021 when it could move as much as 40% in a day. By comparison, the tech-heavy Nasdaq has whipsawed 5-6% on numerous days in 2022, and was down 20% for the year as of March 14, before it rallied to cut half that loss. \"The largest conflict we've seen in Europe since World War Two has really rocked global markets,\" said Pierce Crosby, General Manager at charting platform TradingView in New York. \"What we have seen across other major assets is a huge fallout - from both the U.S. equity markets as well as global markets,\" he added. \"Bitcoin has more or less stayed in a pretty tight range ... but actually, in terms of the relative strength, it's very bullish.\" $2 TRILLION CRYPTO The total value of the cryptocurrency market rose above $2 trillion on Friday, according to analytics platform CoinMarketCap. To put that in context, the market briefly hit $3 trillion on Nov. 10, when bitcoin reached $69,000. The meandering climb back above $2 trillion has been slow and has also been helped by a mushrooming in coins and tokens - the number CoinMarketCap counts has risen by almost 5,000 since November to stand at 18,511 cryptoc .. Bitcoin's market capitalisation has reached $902 billion, but it still has a ways to go to reclaim the $1 trillion it commanded in November. While still the dominant crypto, its market share has also fallen gradually from as much as 70% of the total capitalisation in early 2021 to 42% now. WHAT LIES AHEAD? Many a crypto investor has thought they could divine bitcoin's direction before the fickle cryptocurrency left them sprawled in the financial dust. \"Although bitcoin is remaining strong in the short term, rising oil prices increase the likelihood of a recession over the coming year or so,\" said Marcus Sotiriou, analyst at UK-based digital asset broker GlobalBlock. \"Oil has increased by around 25% in the past six days alone, and bitcoin bulls will want to see this tail off for continued strength.\" That said, certain other technical factors are pointing to bitcoin bullishness. Funding rates, which measure the cost of holding bitcoin via futures, have turned marginally positive after being negative for most of this year, indicating investors are prepared to pay to be long. It stands at 0.003% on analytics platform CryptoQuant, though still below a peak of 0.06% hit in October. Coinglass's longs-to-shorts ratio has also climbed from 0.95 on March 20 to 1.1, the highest level in at least four weeks. Blockchain data provider Chainalysis said an increasing proportion of bitcoin - nearly 60% of total supply - was being held for longer than 52 weeks, up from 54.72% in the last 25 weeks. Blockchain data provider Chainalysis said an increasing proportion of bitcoin - nearly 60% of total supply - was being held for longer than 52 weeks, up from 54.72% in the last 25 weeks. Yet Ashwath Balakrishnan, vice president of research at Delphi Digital in Bengaluru, cautioned that it was difficult to identify a lasting market direction. \"Everyone's a little cautious,\" he said. \"If (bitcoin) rejects off of $46k and goes back down then it probably means we're stuck with range-bound conditions for at least another month or so.\" ",

Since then, the India Crypto Relief Fund has financed several healthcare initiatives, including backing UNICEF with $15 million to provide India with 160 million syringes.   In a release, Sandeep Nailwal said, “These NFTs will serve a special purpose as the proceeds will be utilised for projects that aim to create a significant healthcare impact in Indian communities. The Crypto Relief prides itself for being transparent and responsible with the funds received through various efforts similar to this. The Fund selects novel ideas and innovative projects that provide real-world solutions to existing problems.” In addition to designing the NFTs, EYBlockchain professionals supported the project in an advisory capacity to leverage blockchain-based solutions on blockchain.ey.com to mint the NFTs and use the EY OpsChain Public Finance Manager solution to track the distribution and use of the funds.  “EY Blockchain professionals are very honored to be able to contribute to this amazing program by the Crypto Relief Fund,” said Paul Brody, EY Global Blockchain Leader.  “EY people are proud to donate their time, artistic skills, and expertise for this worthy cause.” ",

Non-fungible tokens (NFTs) represent digital art, music, and gaming collectibles, backed by blockchain technology, the tech that enables the existence of cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin. With economies turning increasingly virtual, NFTs are also expected to enable metaverse. In 2021 alone, the global marketplace for NFTs reached $41 billion, as per data from Chainalysis.  In a release, the platform announced that it would provide a diverse set of NFT collection drops across various segments. It would allow users to trade in NFT drops of Hollywood movies’ IP rights and other niche art collections, in fiat as well as in cryptocurrency holdings. The exchange also aims to tap into the sports NFTs and celebrities’ personal collectibles.  On the occasion of the launch, Kapil Rathi, CEO, and co-founder of CrossTower said, “In 2022, the global market for NFTs reached billions of dollars. The market is expected to grow to over USD 80 billion by 2025. CrossTower not only provides best-in-class tech infrastructure but also offers an all-encompassing financial ecosystem with its listing, trading, and financing capabilities. CrossTower is well-positioned to grow alongside the NFT sector as it expands worldwide.” In addition to the increased crypto adoption rate worldwide, the NFT sector is undergoing a significant change and is booming. It has opened doors of opportunity for the creative ecosystem. Rohit Tandon, Head of Product for Blockchain and Emerging Technology at CrossTower said, “NFT's uniqueness and rapid adoption have created an extraordinary buzz among artists, creators, and their fans. Therefore, we believe, there is a need for a credible NFT marketplace to reach a larger audience as movie actors, cricketers and other artists enter the market. Our collaboration with credible brands is another positive step in the right direction, that will enhance the possibilities for creators and collectors alike.” Also Read: Crypto markets continue rally; Bitcoin close to $47,000 Also Read: ED arrests Kerala man allegedly involved in Morris Coin scam ",

            "header": "Crypto tax: Book gains before April 1 to reduce tax liability, says Taxmann's Naveen Wadhwa",
            "content": "While the Lok Sabha has passed the Finance Bill 2022 that introduced a new scheme to tax crypto gains at a flat rate of 30 per cent from April 1, 2022, questions abound on the tax treatment of past profits earned from cryptocurrencies. So, what happens if one books gains from cryptos on or before March 31, 2022? Do new income tax rules say one still has to pay tax at 30 per cent? Tax experts say that if one is sitting on profits and doesn’t want to be invested for a long tenure, then selling before March 31 might be a good idea. This is because gains will be taxable like normal provisions before April 1, 2022 and treated as capital gains (if you are not doing trading in cryptocurrencies). Hence, if one sells cryptos after 36 months, the profit shall be taxable as Long Term Capital Gains (LTCG) at 20 per cent post indexation. If sold before 36 months, then short term capital gain (STCG) tax should be levied as per the income tax slab which can be anywhere ranging from 0-30 per cent.   “It is advisable to sell crypto before April 1, 2022, as the gains will be taxed as per normal provisions like in the case of sale of gold. The long term capital gains will be taxable at the lower rate of 20 per cent with indexation. The short term will be taxable according to the tax slab one falls into. Moreover, if there are losses, they can be carried forward,” says Naveen Wadhwa, Deputy General Manager at Taxmann, a leading online resource for everything on Indian taxation laws. The Finance Bill 2022, as passed by the Lok Sabha, inserted a new section 115BBH to provide the method of computation and the tax rate for the income arising from the transfer of Virtual Digital Asset (VDA). Now, according to the new rules, gains from cryptos will be taxable at 30 per cent, and there will be no provision for setting off and carrying forward of unclaimed losses. Losses incurred on or before March 31, 2022 It is clear that the Finance Bill has stated that any loss arising from the transfer of VDA would be a dead loss. It will not be allowed to be adjusted even against income arising from the transfer of another VDA. But would such provision impact the losses incurred on or before the assessment year 2022-23, that is, from the sale of crypto assets or NFTs on or before 31-03-2022?   “The assessee should have an absolute right to carry forward and set-off the losses incurred on or before 31-03-2022. However, such losses shall not be allowed to be set off against income taxable under Section 115BBH. Such rights can be exercised within the four corners of the law dealing with intra-head, inter-head and carry forward of losses” says Wadhwa. If there are several sources of income falling under the same head of income, the loss from one source of income may be set-off against the income from another source falling under the same head of income. This is called as intra-head adjustment of losses.   If after setting-off the loss from one source against the income of another source falling under the same head, the net result is still a loss, the loss under one head of income may be set-off against the income under another head in the same previous year. This is called as inter-head adjustment of losses.   If a loss cannot be completely set-off against income under the same head (intra-head adjustment) and against income under another head (inter-head adjustment), then the losses remaining shall be carried forward to next year. Income Tax Act contains certain provisions which do not allow to set-off certain losses, but allow some of them in a particular manner and thus make the aggregation a legal concept. Wadhwa supports the case of carrying forward of losses and cites a similar issue that was dealt with by the Supreme Court in the case of CIT v. Shah Sadiq & Sons [1987] 31 Taxman 498 (SC).   In that case, the apex court held that under the 1922 Act, the assessee was entitled to carry forward the losses of the speculation business and set-off such losses against profits made from that business in future years. The right to carry forward and set-off accrued to the assessee under the 1922 Act. A right that had accrued and had become vested continued to be capable of being enforced notwithstanding the repeal of the statute under which that right accrued unless the repealing statute took away such right expressly. Hence, rights that have accrued are saved unless they are taken away expressly. In the circumstances, the assesse was entitled to the set-off in the assessment year 1963-64. ",

            "content": "The Supreme Court Monday asked a crypto-currency scam accused to disclose the username and password of his Bitcoin wallet to the Enforcement Directorate and cooperate with the investigation in the money laundering case against him.  A bench of Justices D Y Chandrachud and Surya Kant said that subject to Ajay Bhardwaj, accused of running “multi-level marketing scheme” of Bitcoin making full disclosure, his interim protection granted by the court will continue. The apex court asked the ED to file an updated status report in the case. The bench noted in its order, “An application for cancellation of bail has been filed by the respondents. Additional Solicitor General Aishwarya Bhati appearing for ED has filed a status report. ED has submitted that the brother of the petitioner has died and Petitioner (Bhardwaj) is in possession of the username and password of crypto wallets which must be disclosed to the investigating officer”. It also noted the submission of senior advocate P C Sen, appearing for Bhardwaj, that all the records, e-mails and evidence is in custody of Pune Police and he has disclosed all the relevant details. “The petitioner will file a reply on the application for cancellation of bail within two weeks. In the meantime, the petitioner shall cooperate fully with the investigation. Since senior counsel for petitioner states that disclosure has been of the username and password of the wallet, there would be no difficulty for the petitioner to make full disclosure conditional on which the ad interim protection to continue. ED shall file an updated status report”, the bench said. At the outset, Sen said that his client has been asked to join the investigation and he has joined it as and where he was called and has been interrogated for 65 hours. Bhati said that investment in Bitcoin is not through normal banking channels and Bharwdwaj should be asked to disclose the username and password of the crypto-currency wallet he has. She said that although the brother of Bhardwaj has died there are other members of the family who were involved in this case. Bhati said that legality of crypto currency does not arise in this matter as it is all related to a ponzi scheme, where people were duped. “These are all writ petitions with different prayers including transfer of case to CBI and challenging the guidelines of 2016 but nothing has actually come out. It is a Ponzi scheme. All the writ petitions on the same cause and same FIR should be listed together. Advocate Shoeb Alam, appearing for one of the investors Vipin Kohli, said that an application for cancellation of bail has been filed by him as Bhardwaj has not made full disclosure of facts to the court. On February 25, the top court had asked the Centre to make its stand clear on whether crypto currency trade involving Bitcoin or any other such currencies is legal in India or not. The top court was dealing with a case related to the quashing of multiple FIRs registered against Bhardwaj and others for allegedly duping investors across India by inducing them to trade in Bitcoin and assuring them high returns. ED has submitted that they would file an affidavit on the legality of the crypto currency trade and added that the accused, who is seeking quashing of proceedings, has not been cooperating with the investigating agency after being granted bail by the court in 2019. Bhati has said that 47 FIRs have been registered against the accused for duping people across the country and the issue involves a trade of 87,000 Bitcoin worth Rs 20,000 crore. The top court had directed Bhardwaj to appear before the investigating officer of ED within two days and thereafter cooperate with the investigation as and when called upon to do so. The bench said the ad-interim order restraining the arrest of Bhardwaj shall continue till the next date of listing of the matter. Alam had said that Bhardwaj has deliberately suppressed the fact that Chief Metropolitan Magistrate (CMM), Patiala House Court through court notice had issued a proclamation requiring the appearance of the accused under Section 82 of Criminal Procedure Code. The allegation against Bhardwaj is that he along with other co-accused, who are mostly his family members, had induced investors to invest in Bitcoin through a “multi-level marketing scheme” on false promises of securing to the investors a 10 per cent assured monthly returns for 18 months that is total of 180 percent profit. It was alleged that due to the dishonest inducement, the customers invested their Bitcoins in the said business, but after making investment they did not get the assured returns. The FIRs also said that to escape from inevitable punishment under the law, Bhardwaj and other co-accused persons collectively, in a dishonest manner and with the deliberate intention of destroying all the evidence shut down the fake 'gainbitcoin' website through which investors made the investment.

            "content": "Jupiter Meta, a fully curated NFT marketplace, has announced the launch of music NFTs. The music NFTs would be offered during a metaverse concert featuring South Indian singer and composer Karthik. The metaverse concert would take place on April 14. The tickets of the concert would be stored as NFTs in the buyer’s wallet and would also possess future tradeable value. Ticket holders would be credited with the new tracks as music NFTs. The owners could then use those NFTs any way they want.  Manasa Rajan, CEO of Jupiter Meta said, “The metaverse isn’t just a buzzword anymore. It has real implications and brings actual value to the way we interact with one another and with intangibles such as culture and the sense of community.” She further added, “Music NFTs will give users a specific value and sense of ownership that cannot be replicated, while the concert will bridge the physical divide between artist and fan in a sense and open the doors for more personalised and meaningful conversations outside our reality.” The performer, Karthik also expressed delight at being able to connect with his fanbase in this unique manner. In a release, he said, “Doing something like this in the metaverse is beyond imagination! I’m really happy fans get to experience this special moment and own my new songs! It is going to be rocking.” Interested buyers can buy the ticket to the concert by paying via Internet banking, debit, and credit card, as well as by UPI. The interested buyers need not have a crypto wallet and crypto assets to buy the tickets.

            "content": "Diginoor, an NFT platform, has minted a 30-minute track of late singer S.P. Balasubramanyam and they plan on auctioning it on April 9. Apart from the audio NFT, the buyer will also be transferred 51 per cent of the copyright, giving the NFT holder the right to make the song available to the larger public, adapt or reproduce it in any manner. The track is the last piece recorded by S.P. Balasubramanyam before he passed away in 2020 because of complications caused by COVID-19.   S.P. Balasubramanyam is a six-time national award winner and Padma Vibhushan awardee. He has recorded over 40,000 songs in 16 languages during his musical career. Speaking about the NFT drop, S. P. Charan, filmmaker, playback singer, and the late singer's son said, \"It gives us great joy to announce the NFT drop of my father's last unreleased song. We are thankful to Diginoor for creating this NFT, and carrying on the legacy of Shri S.P. Balasubrahmanyam. I hope that his fans will enjoy this limited edition NFT.” The track, a Tamil devotional song, recorded by the late singer is titled Vishwaroopa Darisanam and was recorded in collaboration with the music label Symphony Records.  Sri Hari, CEO of Symphony Records said, “The inimitable singing style of legendary S.P. Balasubrahmanyam sir makes even the most classical compositions so touching and emotional. We are proud to conceptualise and produce this rare album which is a tribute to his melodious voice that will stay with us forever. Symphony is glad to partner with Diginoor to launch SPB’s last song as an NFT, giving a chance to his fans and music lovers to have co-ownership of sir’s Magnum Opus and its copyrights.\" It is interesting to note that Diginoor was founded by 18-year-old Chennai-based entrepreneurs Shaamil Karim and Yash Rathod. Shaamil Karim, founder, and CEO, of Diginoor said, “As a Tamilian, it brings me great pride to release S. P. Balasubrahmanyam sir’s magnum opus on Diginoor exclusively for his legacy to live on the blockchain forever. This is also the first time in the industry that the NFT will facilitate the transfer of 51 percent of the copyright to this musical masterpiece to the winning bid.”  NFTs are non-transferable units of data that are stored on a blockchain, which is a type of digital ledger. Numerous different types of NFT data units can be used to store digital items such as images, movies, and audio.  ",

The accused was asked to cooperate with the investigation by giving the username and password to his cryptocurrency wallet and making full disclosures to the investigating agency by a Bench led by Justice DY Chandrachud. Additionally, the complainant's counsel, Advocate Shoeb Alam, was requested to give a list of all current charges brought against the defendants in connection with the scheme. The Court was considering Bhardwaj's petition for the charges against him to be withdrawn. He is charged alongside his brother Amit Bhardwaj, who was the face of the GainBitcoin scam. Amit Bhardwaj passed away in January this year due to health complications. What is the GainBitcoin scam? Gainbitcoin was a multi-level marketing scheme run by Amit Bhardwaj. They guaranteed a 10 per cent monthly return in Bitcoin-on-Bitcoin deposits for 18 months via multi-level marketing (MLM) programs. Investors were enticed to lend the corporation Bitcoins on the promise that their investments will be increased during the aforementioned period. However, since there are only a limited number of Bitcoins, the logic of this MLM seemed deeply flawed, but many investors had already put their money in it without realising the error in their decisions. Investors never received the principal amount and interest in Bitcoin. Both the principal and the interest were repaid in a currency called MCAP, which was created by the promoters of GainBitcoin. MCAP did not have the intrinsic value that Bitcoin had, and all the investors lost their money. ",

            "content": "Malaysian Deputy Finance Minister clarified on Thursday in the parliament that Malaysia has no plans of accepting Bitcoin as a legal tender in the country. Mohd Shahar Abdullah, the Deputy Finance Minister, blamed the price volatility and Bitcoin’s susceptibility to cyber-attacks as the main reasons behind its unsuitability as a legal tender.  \"Cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin are not suitable for use as a payment instrument due to various limitations,” the deputy minister further explained. The deputy minister's remarks are in response to Malaysian Deputy Minister of Communications, Zahidi Zainul’s proposal to make Bitcoin legal tender in Malaysia, which was put forward in the Malaysian parliament last week, as reported by Business Today. Malaysia is already examining the idea of a central bank digital currency, or popularly known as CBDC. The Central Bank of Malaysia has joined a trial with the Bank for International Settlements to develop a proof of concept for their CBDC. \"The evolving technical and payment landscape has motivated Bank Negara Malaysia to conduct an in-depth examination of the prospects for central bank digital currencies, also known as central bank digital currency,\" Mohd Shahar added. Central bank digital currencies are essentially electronic representations of national currencies. Unlike cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin, they can be regulated and are not decentralised. Malaysia ranks 23rd on Chainalysis' 2021 Global Crypto Adoption Index. The general population of the country is already comfortable with transacting using cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin.

The proceeds from the sale would go to Liliesleaf Museum Heritage Site. In 2004, the original arrest warrant was given to the Liliesleaf Museum Heritage Site. The museum minted the arrest warrant as an NFT to raise proceeds for the upkeep of the museum. Mandela was a prominent leader in the Anti-Apartheid movement in South Africa. He was jailed from 1962 to 1990, for 27 years, for trying to overthrow the White minority government in the country. He later became South Africa's first black president. Liliesleaf museum, which was previously a farm, was used as the African National Congress's secret headquarters from 1961. Mandela and other party leaders hid in the Lilieseaf farms from the police and the government authorities and, hence, Lilieseaf holds a lot of significance in the Anti-Apartheid history.  NFTs are non-transferable units of data that are stored on a blockchain, which is a type of digital ledger. Numerous different types of NFT data units can be used to store digital items such as images, movies, and audio. NFTs differ from blockchain-based cryptocurrencies such as Bitcoin in that each NFT unit is uniquely identifiable.

            "content": "Ukraine started auctioning off a collection of non-fungible tokens (NFTs) on Friday in an expansion of a cryptocurrency fundraising push that Kyiv says has already collected more than $65 million for its war effort.  The 'Meta History: Museum of War' collection is a series of digital images - including silhouettes of warplanes, screengrabs of news reports and a cartoon-style image of an explosion - each one marking a different day in the conflict.  Ukraine's Ministry of Digital Transformation started appealing for donations in digital tokens such as bitcoin and ether three days after Russia launched its invasion, which Moscow calls a \"special military operation\".  Also Read: Russia-Ukraine war shines a spotlight on cryptocurrency The new NFT series was meant \"to spread truthful information among the digital community in the world and to collect donations for the support of Ukraine,\" according to a message on the collection's website.  Non-fungible tokens (NFTs) are a type of crypto asset that exploded in popularity last year. They use the technology behind bitcoin to record who owns a digital file from an image to a video or piece of text.  Ukraine has so far bought supplies for its military with its crypto donations including bulletproof vests, helmets, lunches and medicines, Ukraine's deputy minister of digital transformation, Alex Bornyakov, said on Twitter this month.  Also Read: Ukraine receives around $100 mn in crypto donations NFTs are usually bought with cryptocurrencies such as ether. Ukraine's NFTs will initially cost 0.15 ether, or just over $475. The funds will go directly to Kyiv's digital crypto wallets, according to the website.  The explosive rise in NFT sales left many observers baffled as to why so much money is spent on items that don't physically exist.  Still, they have become a popular fundraising tool in recent months, with groups of people pooling their crypto funds to buy NFTs to raise awareness of a particular cause. ",

The screening will allow users to create virtual avatars and attend the event. According to the company's statement, this event has been conceptualised by Wavemaker India for Perfetti Van Melle India in partnership with Viacom18. Nina Elavia Jaipuria, Head - Hindi Mass Entertainment and Kids TV Network, Viacom18, said, “Nickelodeon Kids’ Choice Awards reiterates our commitment towards empowering and encouraging young audiences to voice their choice.

Always ahead of the curve, Nickelodeon has created new benchmarks for innovation in the category and KCA 2021 is all set to provide a seamless unified experience to consumers on a platform of their choice including the first ever metaverse screening in the category.” This comes in the backdrop of the Indian entertainment industry getting increasingly involved in Web3.

Popstar Daler Mehendi performed in the PartyNite metaverse on the occasion of India’s Republic Day in January, and he even bought a piece of land in the metaverse. Also, the Bollywood movie Radhe Shyam too had its trailer launched in the metaverse recently. The integration of Web3 and the entertainment industry has led to many more immersive experiences for the audiences to enjoy. ",

            "content": "Crypto exchange platform CoinDCX announced on Thursday the launch of its crypto investment plan (CIP). This would allow investors to invest a fixed amount in crypto at regular intervals.  The new program rolled out by CoinDCX is designed to provide a disciplined approach to users when it comes to investing. CIP offers investment installments on a weekly basis where investors can invest a fixed amount every week.  It is interesting to note that small investments in fixed intervals of time give investors the benefits of rupee cost averaging, lowering market volatility risks over time, and countering the volatile nature of any asset class. Customers benefit from compounded returns, enabling them to build their wealth on a long-term basis.  Commenting on the rollout of the new feature, CoinDCX CEO and co-Founder Sumit Gupta said, “ Retail investors often find themselves at the crossroads as to which asset to invest in, and at what price to invest at. CoinDCX is actively working to develop products with a clear objective of providing our customers the most value when they invest with us. CIP is one such product through which we are helping investors to stop worrying about timing investments with the market, addressing the dynamic nature of crypto and building greater confidence by minimising risks in crypto investing.” Recently, CoinDCX launched a blockchain literacy program in partnership with BITS Pilani. The crypto exchange has been launching several initiatives to bring crypto and Web3 to the mainstream. ",

Coinbase Ventures has also announced that the 5 shortlisted start-ups will win from a prize pool of up to $1 million in addition to $25,000 in grants along with mentorship support from DAO Belief. DAO is a grants program that provides grant amounts of $5,000 - $25,000 with a quick disbursement period to help push founders, developers, and start-ups to meet their short-term goals. This marks a strategic focus of Coinbase in India’s Web3 start-up ecosystem apart from the investment in cryptocurrency exchange, CoinSwitch Kuber last year. The Web3 start-up ecosystem has expanded considerably in recent years and has garnered significant interest. The space saw a record $17 billion in funding last year and has already crossed $3 billion this year. Being the third-largest start-up ecosystem globally, India has been recognised as a technology hub with several global names hoping to tap into developer talent, as per a company handout. “At Coinbase, we are extremely excited about Web3 innovation happening in India and look forward to continuing our ongoing support of the Indian crypto/Web3 ecosystem.  The Web3 community in India is quickly becoming a global force, and with our initiative with Builders Tribe, we are demonstrating our commitment to fostering this talent,” Shan Aggarwal, VP, Coinbase Ventures said. A select twenty-five innovative start-ups with sustainable ideas will be granted the opportunity to submit video pitches for review by the Coinbase Ventures team, and a shortlist of the top entries will be invited to pitch live on April 8. “Builders Tribe’s aim has always been to support Web3 innovation in all its forms and give the innovators the right platform. This partnership with Coinbase Ventures is a step in this direction. We are glad that Coinbase Ventures has made a commitment the Indian Web3 ecosystem and to support and foster innovation among these start-ups. India has been at the forefront of the Web3 boom globally and has been bullish on the potential of this technology. We see a huge influx of global Web3 players recognizing this potential of the Indian developer ecosystem and are incredibly proud to stand with our fellow Web3 pioneers. We look forward to interesting projects that are building a sustainable decentralised space for all,\" said Pareen Lathia, co-founder, Builders Tribe.

This would mean that loss from the transfer of virtual digital assets (VDA) will not be allowed to be set off against the income arising from the transfer of another VDA. According to the Finance Bill, 2022, a VDA could be a code or number or token which can be transferred, stored or traded electronically. The VDAs will include prevailing cryptocurrencies and non-fungible tokens (NFTs) which has gained fad over the past couple of years. The 2022-23 Budget has brought in clarity concerning the levy of income tax on crypto assets. From April 1, a 30 per cent I-T plus cess and surcharges, will be levied on such transactions in the same manner as it treats winnings from horse races or other speculative transactions. Also, while computing the income from transfer of VDA, no deduction in respect of any expenditure (other than the cost of acquisition) or allowance will be allowed. The Budget 2022-23 also proposed a 1 per cent TDS on payments towards virtual currencies beyond Rs 10,000 in a year and taxation of such gifts in the hands of the recipient. The threshold limit for TDS would be Rs 50,000 a year for specified persons, which include individuals/HUFs who are required to get their accounts audited under the I-T Act. The provisions related to 1 per cent TDS will come into effect from July 1, 2022, while the gains will be taxed effective April 1. Separately, the government is working on legislation to regulate cryptocurrencies, but no draft has yet been released publicly. The amendments to the Finance Bill also propose to dilute the penalty provision relating to publication of export-import data. The Finance Bill had proposed to insert a new Section 135AA in the Customs Act which stated: “if a person publishes any information relating to the value or classification or quantity of goods entered for export from India, or import into India, or the details of the exporter or importer of such goods under this Act, unless required so to do under any law for the time being in force, he shall be punishable with imprisonment for a term which may extend to six months, or with fine which may extend to fifty thousand rupees, or with both”. The amendments seeks to do away with six-month imprisonment and the Rs 50,000 penalty. The amendment now reads: ''if a person publishes any information, that is furnished to Customs by an exporter or importer under this Act, relating to the value or classification or quantity of goods entered for export from India, or import into India, along with the identity of the persons involved or in a manner that leads to disclosure of such identity unless required so to do under any law for the time being in force, or by specific authorisation of such exporter or importer, he shall be punishable with imprisonment''.

            "content": "Crypto industry body Blockchain and Crypto Assets Council (BACC) has said that the government's decision to not allow offsetting losses arising from investing in virtual digital assets (or VDAs) can have a negative impact on investor behaviour and tax collection. This comes against the backdrop of the criticisms that the new crypto tax laws have drawn from leading stakeholders in the cryptocurrency industry. The new tax proposals, as delineated by finance minister Nirmala Sitharaman during her 2022 Budget speech and clarified recently by the finance ministry in the Lok Sabha, include a 30 per cent capital gains tax, a 1 per cent tax deducted at the source, and disallowing offsetting of losses from investing in cryptos. “The lack of an opportunity to offset expenses and carry forward losses will act as a deterrent for small businesses and will hamper wider adoption. While the government has allowed carrying forward losses in the shares trading business, crypto trading should have been given the same treatment,” said Sumit Gupta, co-chair of BACC and founder-CEO of the crypto exchange CoinDCX. “We fear the lack of provision to offset losses will drive away users from KYC-compliant exchanges and platforms to the peer-to-peer grey market, which would defeat the purpose of the new tax. The Budget recognised virtual digital assets (VDAs) as an emerging asset class. Therefore, a natural course of action would have been to progressively bring the regulations at par with other asset classes. Instead, yesterday, with this clarification in Parliament, we have taken a step backwards. If a regressive provision such as this would have been applicable in equities, it would have discouraged retail investors from participating,” added Ashish Singhal, co-chair of BACC and founder-CEO of another crypto exchange, CoinSwitch Kuber.

Furthermore, the country's central bank has reaffirmed its jurisdiction under Honduras' constitution as the country's sole authorised “issuer of banknotes and coins” which would be deemed legal currency in the nation. “BCH does not supervise or guarantee operations carried out with cryptocurrencies as means of payment,” it in a statement. “Any transaction carried out with these types of virtual assets is the responsibility and risk of those who do it,” it further explained. Despite not being open to accepting Bitcoin as legal tender, for the time being, the Central Bank of Honduras did announce that they were continuing to investigate the viability of launching a central bank digital currency, or CBDC. Moreover, the Central Bank announced that the CBDC would be treated as legal tender in the country and would be regulated appropriately. It is worth noting that the Central Bank of Honduras had to come out with this statement because, in the past few days, multiple news outlets claimed that Honduran President Xiomara Castro was considering accepting Bitcoin as legal tender.

            "content": "Tezos India announced a strategic collaboration with Indira Gandhi Delhi Technical University for Women (IGDTUW), New Delhi on Thursday to focus on blockchain literacy amongst female students. Tezos India, the organisation supporting the Tezos decentralised open-source blockchain ecosystem in India, has partnered with IGDTUW to kickstart the Tezos IGDTUW Student Chapter in order to train and raise awareness related to blockchain amongst the female students of the institute pursuing engineering in various streams. It is worth noting that blockchain literacy and Web3 skills are gaining popularity and demand amongst employers. As discussed in the Business Today Crypto Conclave held on Tuesday, these skills are going to be fundamental in building the tech of the future. The Tezos IGDTUW Student Chapter would organize a series of workshops, hackathons, and mentorship sessions on the campus.  It is also interesting to note that women are severely underrepresented in technology, and more so in Web3. The same points were raised by Poorvi Sachar, Head of Operations, Tezos India “With blockchain technology already revolutionising the existing world order, it is essential to impart first-hand knowledge to women who are utterly underrepresented in the technical community. It is a no-brainer that for blockchain to become mainstream in India, women’s adoption and participation as builders and users of the technology are imperative, and with collaborations with renowned women-only institutions like IGDTUW, we at Tezos India are attempting to achieve the same.” Tezos India has plans to bring more women developers and professionals into the Web3 mainstream. According to a release, they are planning to collaborate with more women's colleges, universities, and institutions to popularise blockchain literacy. Furthermore, Tezos India also has an initiative titled ‘SheCrypt’ to encourage the participation of women in the crypto and blockchain ecosystem. Under this initiative, they host masterclasses, workshops, and training programs to promote women’s participation in the crypto and blockchain arena.

The platform claims to provide Predict-to-Earn opportunities to its audience various sporting events. The platform claims to allow users opportunities to earn crypto rewards for correct predictions on major sporting events.  The platform announced in a release that the native token of the platform is BetU token and the token holders get to access the EarnU platform for free. Moreover, the rewards for correct predictions would also be received in BetU tokens. Users would be able to allow their rewards in BetU tokens or swap them for Ether, Binance Token or USDT Tether. Paul Rogash, CEO and Founder of EarnU said on the occasion of the launch “Indian audience is passionate about a lot of sports and esports, also in the recent times the acceptance towards crypto has increased multi-fold. Therefore, it makes complete sense for us to offer a new age predict-to-earn platform in the market that is a combination of the two rising interests among users.” Web3 has opened up several opportunities for fans to engage with their favorite sports personalities and P2E games are just one medium. Non-Fungible Tokens or NFTs are another such way through which sportspersons and their audience connect via Web3 and blockchain technology. ",

            "content": "In a decision that would bolster crypto adoption across the world, Florida Governor Ron DeSantis confirmed that the US state of Florida is open to accepting taxes in cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin from businesses operating in the state. DeSantis is expected to be a strong contender for the Republican presidential nomination in 2024 if former president Donald Trump drops out of the race and this announcement in favor of cryptocurrencies might be a move to pander to the crypto communities. DeSantis said on Tuesday, “We will accept Bitcoin, we're working on doing that, for payments in the state of Florida.” He also clarified that this would mainly be for businesses operating in the state.  \"I've told the state agencies to figure out ways where if a business wants to pay tax in cryptocurrency to Florida, we should be willing to accept that,\" he clarified. Florida has been very supportive of the crypto movement. Francis Suarez, the mayor of Miami, a popular city in Miami, accepts a part of his salary in Bitcoin as a hedge against inflation. Other US states are also warming up to crypto in order to facilitate its adoption across the country. In 2018, the Seminole County Tax Office in Orlando began accepting cryptocurrency payments via BitPay. The states of Wyoming and Colorado have both passed pro-crypto legislation to promote the states as hubs for crypto innovation. Apart from some cities in the US, other countries and cities, like Dubai, Singapore, Thailand, South Korea, etc, are warming up to crypto and Web3 with lenient legislation to promote the locations as hubs for Web3 innovation and development.

On being a pioneer in the Metaverse, Daler Mehndi said, “I went with an open mind on PartyNite Metaverse and it was a very rewarding experience. Audiences have moved online and I believe it is going to stay. The physical world has its own charm but with Metaverse, sky’s the limit. I really enjoyed performing on PartyNite and I wanted a permanent presence & hence created Balle Balle Land.”  Mehendi plans on using the Balle Balle Land as a platform to promote Punjabi and Sufi music across the world. He further added, “This platform will also help me nurture talent and help the music community of Punjab, Sufi, Pop music & Bollywood grow”. Rajat Ojha, creator of PartyNite  Metaverse had similar views. He said, “We want to grow a community of musicians and integrate as much as possible with the physical world. It is an ever-expanding space and there is a huge scope for innovation. Daler Mehndi will be remembered as the frontrunner in this space in India. We welcome him wholeheartedly to the PartyNite family”. Also Read: Crypto markets continue upward movement; Bitcoin over $42,000 Also Read: How to buy an NFT and not get duped, experts explain ",

            "content": "Non-Fungible Tokens or NFTs are the latest Web3 feature that is taking the world by a storm. Digital artworks and collectibles are being sold for millions of dollars, celebrities are minting their NFTs, movie studios are getting in for promotion and merchandising, NFT Play to Earn games are becoming a big industry, but how can people like you and ride the NFT bandwagon? Experts at the Business Today Crypto Conclave have sorted it out for us! Kashif Raza, founder of Bitinning explains how to choose an NFT before investing. He compares NFT projects to start-ups saying most projects would fail. He also advises the new investors about the two types of NFTs that are available in the NFT marketplaces. He said “There are two kinds of NFTs, licensed NFTs and unlicensed NFTs. Licensed NFTs are NFTs which are authorised by creators like Yuvraj Singh or Prithvi Shaw, and they are listed on NFT marketplaces.” He further explains how users can invest in other kinds of NFTs and what steps they need to keep in mind while doing so. “Join the Discord channels of NFT projects and try to get into the Whitelist where you can actually contribute to the ecosystem and you get NFTs for free by the way.” Whitelists in the context of NFTs are sort of like VIP lists of members of the community who can mint the NFTs of the project in their name before the sale goes live for the public. They can also contribute to the ecosystem by giving suggestions to the core team of the project. Raza further highlighted that choosing an NFT is as difficult as choosing another financial product. “It takes a lot of pain and patience to choose an NFT. Do not just go on a website without research and put your money because you will most likely lose your money that way.” He further added, “The process is just like buying mutual funds or stocks or other financial assets. You need to do your research, consult with your family, your financial consultants before making an investment.” Well, now that the process has been clarified, let us hope we make smart investments and not lose our money in scam NFT projects.

            "content": "Cricket is that glue that unites India across its length and breadth. Cricketers from the past and present have created an enviably massive follower base in India. Taking the enthusiasm for cricket into the annals of the latest technology, GuardianLink, an NFT marketplace, has launched the world’s first NFT cricket game on Wednesday.  The game has been launched on the Jump.trade platform. It would be available on Android, iOS, and also on PC. GuardianLink claims that it is the first-of-its-kind game that is community-driven and enables the players to monetise their time and efforts playing while playing the game.  On the occasion of the launch, Ramkumar Subramaniam, co-Founder, and CEO of GuardianLink said, “Watching cricket in India has always been a treat for every buff, especially nowadays, with the new formats. We consider this the best time to announce the launch of India’s pioneering NFT cricket game, which will serve as a unique product for every cricket enthusiast. We also aim to create India’s first metaverse for cricket. The users can play both free and play-to-earn mode, subject to the end-goal which could be pure entertainment or earning a passive income.” The players can leverage the NFTs (in-game assets) to earn rewards, drive value, and trade. In the long-term, the NFT marketplace plans on introducing features that would focus on player ownership, such as NFT real-estate, customisable avatars, a playable metaverse, etc. which would appeal to the cricket fans in India. In addition, GuardianLink is also working towards creating a marketplace where users can participate in drops and trades of international and gaming NFTs. It is noteworthy to mention that with the boom in Web3, NFT Play to Earn games are taking center stage. Axie Infinity, DeFi Kings, Crypto Mines, etc. are some popular Play to Earn NFT games. ",

The president of the institute also clarified that the decision to work on this research paper is a result of several requests by the members of ICAI who were confused with this new asset class. He also informed that the paper would be prepared and released in April. \"Auditing crypto is complex, given the nature of its transaction,\" Mitra said. \"So, even when the taxation part is somewhat clear, auditing it is tricky. That is why we felt the need to work on the paper on it which will bring better clarity on the matter.\" It is noteworthy to mention that the Union Budget 2022-23 has proposed a 30 per cent flat income tax on crypto assets from April 1. Moreover, a 1 per cent TDS has also been introduced. And during recent proceedings at the Parliament, Pankaj Chaudhary, Minister of State, Ministry of Finance clarified that there would be no set off or deductions when it comes to taxation of cryptocurrencies.

            "content": "Thailand will prohibit the use of cryptos to pay for products and services, claiming that broad use would jeopardise the country's financial system and economy. The Thai regulator stated in an announcement on Wednesday that businesses, including cryptocurrency exchanges, are prohibited from accepting payments in cryptocurrencies to pay for goods and services. The announcement further clarified that the prohibition on the use of cryptos for payments would be effective from April 1. The new regulations prohibit crypto asset service providers from advertising, soliciting, or building systems for paying for goods and services using cryptocureencies and if customers persist, their accounts would be deleted in retaliation. The regulator justifies this move by stating that any price unit other than the Thai baht increases the cost of economic activity and impairs the transmission of monetary policy. The Bank of Thailand has declared that in the event of a liquidity crisis, it will be unable to support various financial institutions in currencies other than the Thai baht. Despite the new negative stance of crypto payments, Thailand has been trying to amp up the country's position as a hub for Web3. Earlier this month the country eased its taxation laws on crypto to promote the use of crypto assets and attract businesses to set shops in Thailand. ",

            "content": "Christine Lagarde, Managing Director of European Central Bank (ECB) said cryptocurrencies are a cause of concern and said that they “remain a threat”. While speaking at the Bank for International Settlements’ Innovation Summit on Tuesday, Lagarde also called out cryptocurrency service providers. She said they have been acting as an \"accomplice\" to Russia in avoiding sanctions imposed on the country by nations across the world in solidarity with Ukraine. Lagarde highlighted that the amount of Russian rubles invested in Bitcoin and stablecoins has been increasing. It is noteworthy to mention that Business Today has previously reported that trading volumes between the Russian ruble and Bitcoin have increased to a nine-month high, despite the fact that the country's fiat currency has fallen to record lows against the dollar in the aftermath of Russia’s invasion of Ukraine in late February. Regulators from across the world have imposed severe sanctions on Russia in an attempt to isolate their economy. Moreover, Lagarde's also implied that crypto assets are often involved with financial criminality. \"So is it a threat? Yes. Has it … been a threat in the past? Yes, because when you look at a lot of the dubious transactions that are taking place, a lot of the criminal activities payments that are taking place, very often you find some crypto assets,” she said. Also important to mention that the EU's complex legislative framework for crypto, Markets in Crypto Assets (or better known as MiCA), is being debated in the EU Parliament. ",

            "content": "Restating the importance of Prime Minister Narendra Modi's vision of making India a self-reliant nation, Union Minister of State for Electronics and Information Technology Rajeev Chandrasekhar on Tuesday said India should minimise its dependence on international internet networks. Speaking at Business Today Crypto Conclave in New Delhi, the minister said that the current conflict between Ukraine and Russia has highlighted the importance of self-reliance when it comes to internet. \"One of the things that we've learned after looking at the Ukraine-Russia incident is that the internet can also become a tool of war. And the weaponisation of the internet has become something that is, at least to me...personally I'm a little disturbed that the internet can be seen to be taking sides and blockades of the internet can be imposed on one nation versus the other nation, and that in my opinion is extremely disturbing,\" Chandrasekhar said. The current situation of the world shows that India needs to build more champions and have a much more resilient internet topology that depends less on the international players. \"We need to minimise our dependence on international internet networks if you want to call it that. We need to be very careful about data localisation and cross-border data flows,\" he said. Also Read: BT Crypto Conclave: India needs a new digital law, says Rajeev Chandrasekhar Another area that he talked about was building capabilities against cybercrimes. \"And one big area for me is the fact that intermediaries, especially big tech, who have gained so much from the internet, and who have constantly rallied against the government, whether it's Indian government or any other government, have done so little on the issue of safety on the internet, and cyber hacking or cyber incidents. So I think that area is a very important focus area. We are building upon capacities and tools. Of course, we have significant capacities and tools within the government,\" Chandrasekhar said. The government is also exploring the need for global rulemaking as the criminal, crime and the victim are almost always or very often in three different jurisdictions on the internet. There is no one law that can capture the entire chain of the event of the incident, he said.  \"So having more and more global rulemaking, more and more global protocols which allow countries to interact, work together...sort of let us say Singapore and India, or India and Australia, India and US-- all collaborating within a cyber incident. I think that is an additional feature of the model that we are hoping to develop,\" he added. Also Read: No ban on owning crypto assets in India: Rajeev Chandrasekhar\n  ",

            "content": "The over two-decade-old IT Act that regulates India's cyberspace and internet needs to be revised with a new IT law, Union Minister of State for Electronics and Information Technology Rajeev Chandrasekhar said on Tuesday and pitched for a new digital law. \"The basic law that today regulates the cyberspace and the Indian internet is called the IT Act. And the IT Act was enacted in 2000. So it is 22 years old. 22 years in the internet age is like three centuries, five centuries. I think it is clear in our minds, and I think to any observer's mind, that we need a new digital law,\" Chandrasekhar said at Business Today Crypto Conclave 2022.  The minister said that the new digital law should address not just all the opportunities and rules around those opportunities but also user harm issues and other areas around the internet for which currently there are no rules.  \"For example, the openness, how do we ensure that the App store duopoly is addressed? How do we make sure that these search engine monopolies are addressed? How do we make sure that these new invasive devices like, you know, the glasses are dealt with? There is on the device side...and then there is this whole new emerging phenomenon of AI and algorithms and ethical use of that, Iris...use of that? So all of these areas that we believe are areas that directly impact the consumer, and need to be in a sense, if not regulated, but at least need to have proper global standard rules for how intermediaries conduct themselves around these areas or manufacturers, as the case may be, need to be framed,\" he said. Also Read: No ban on owning crypto assets in India: Rajeev Chandrasekhar Chandrasekhar said that India's IT Act is a vintage Act that does not even have the word 'internet' in it. \"We have an IT act which is 22 years old. We have done some intermediary rules, we will do some cybersecurity roles, we will do some privacy rules...it's all stop gap bandage type of approach. And if anybody has read the IT Act, you know that the word internet does not even exist in the IT Act. And so, you know, that is how vintage the Act is.\" Emphasising the need to have a new digital law, the minister said that India should establish a data governance framework because India is an extremely data-intensive country.   \"Now with over a billion Indians who are going to go online and be connected to the internet very shortly, the intensity of the public cloud, the expansion of the public cloud is going to be very, very fast in the next two-three years. So we are going to be sitting on huge amounts of data. A data governance framework, a data management, institutional framework, new digital law, data protection law -- these are to be seen as pieces of an overall overarching sort of jurisprudence that will allow both start-ups and innovation to continue to grow and prosper, as well as protect the user and the citizen from all of the risks and ills of the internet,\" he added. While he didn't share the precise details and date for announcing the new structure, Chandrasekhar clarified that the government is fairly far along in the process of thinking. The objective of policymaking is that the internet should always be open and will be safe, trusted and accountable towards users and consumers, he said.

            "content": "Putting aside the confusion about owning cryptocurrency, Union Minister of State for Electronics and Information Technology Rajeev Chandrasekhar, while speaking at Business Today’s Crypto Conclave 2022 in New Delhi on Tuesday, in very clear words stated that there is no ban on owing cypto assets in India. “There is no ban on owning crypto assets. There's clearly a recognition that the digital virtual asset is a category of assets going forward, whether it's an NFT (non-fungible token) or crypto, or even something else in the future, these are things that people will start accumulating through the liberalized remittance scheme (LRS) or any other way,” said Chandrasekhar. He further clarified that “the rupee obviously, is not a fully convertible currency and therefore, there are restrictions on how you can use the rupee to buy assets that are non-rupee assets. And, the RBI has laid down many ways of doing that. The LRS is the easiest way for an individual to invest in any asset he or she wants, and there is no disqualification from anybody owning a crypto asset as part of his portfolio of assets.” On whether the tax rate on cryptocurrencies is high, the minister added, \"These are things that evolve over time and as you know, in anything that is unknown or less understood, usually the instinct is to tax it at a higher rate. And then as people become comfortable with it, those tax rates obviously moderate” Further, commenting on the regulatory structures (which are not very clear), Chandrasekhar added there is clarity after the Budget that if one is looking for domestic crypto assets there will be only one and that would be the RBI issued CBDC, and that will be the digital Rupee. “And as that rolls out, the way the issuance of that, the mining of that, the minting of that, the buying of that will become clear from the issue of the RBI. So, frankly, from my point of view, I think the landscape is very clear. There are some questions around existing crypto exchanges, crypto brokers, p2p types of trades on cryptos. What happens, who regulates them? And I think that will evolve.” He also clarified that the government’s approach to policymaking is not slow as it is measured with a lot of public consultations and making the right moves with the right amount of knowledge and consultation and an engagement with the principal stakeholders of the industry, and the ecosystem.

            "content": "It is a matter of debate whether a cryptocurrency will replace US dollar for international transactions in the coming years. However, Rajnish Kumar, chairman, BharatPe and former chairman SBI believes crypto is the buzzword of the new age economy and it is not defined by national boundaries. He thinks that everybody including judicial systems, governments and central banks are still trying to understand and figure out what it is. While sharing his views at Business Today Crypto Conclave, he said, “I would not be surprised to see crypto as a currency for international transaction over the next 10 years.” Kumar further added that the US dollar is not always a reserve currency. It was after World War II, the US dollar became reserve currency. On the other hand, former finance secretary Subhash Chandra Garg added that the moment e-dollar or the digital dollar will come in, the global currency will retain the primacy it has today in the international payment system. “Digital rupee, whenever it will come, will have a very small role to play because the rupee is not an international currency,” Garg said. Commenting on the regulations, Garg added that the crypto world has three kinds of phenomenon which includes currency, services and assets like NFT. “These things require different ways to regulate,” he said, adding all these crypto platforms today recognise as decentralised autonomous organisations (DAO). Experts also believe that there is a need to understand the technology. “We are over-possessive and over-focussed on the currency. Still, a lot is not understood,” Garg said. Cyril Shroff, managing partner, Cyril Amarchand Mangaldas, seconds Garg and said nobody still understands this yet. “It is a bit like six blind men and elephant. The whole world is trying to figure out what this technology and new system mean. So, there is a need to increase in awareness.” NS Nappinai, advocate, Supreme Court and founder, Cyber Saathi, also said crypto assets may be at some level could be utilised as a payment mechanism. “However, how do you regulate them will be an issue,” she added.

            "header": "Government stance on crypto taxation surprising, say tax experts",
            "content": "Tax experts are a surprised lot after the government announced that while gains from crypto transactions will be taxed at 30 per cent, any losses arising from one crypto asset will not be allowed to be set-off against profits in another.  \"We have a situation of losses and gains being sort of treated as separate pots. In substance really, if you are taxing something at 30 per cent, why would you not allow losses under other heads also to be set off within the same year also beats us,\" said Dinesh Kanabar, CEO of Dhruva Advisors, while speaking at the Business Today Crypto Conclave.  In a similar context, Mukesh Butani, founder and managing partner of BMR Legal, said that while it is right for the government to tax an income that has been untaxed till now, the approach seems to be creating a perception that cryptos lead to unaccounted income.  \"My problem with the basis on which you are implementing it is that there seems to be an element of perception associated with crypto, something that stinks,\" said Butani in a session titled, 'Taxing Cryptos: Need for Clarity'.  \"I don't think that is the correct approach. It's one thing to say that the government has a stated public policy that it would discourage unaccounted income. And somewhere, there seems to be a perception that a crypto transaction results in unaccounted money,\" he added.  The perception element was highlighted by L Badri Narayanan, executive partner at Laxmikumaran & Sridharan, as well when he said that the statement from the government hints that it treats this as speculative income.  Also Read: Crypto tax may lead to brain drain, impact trading: CoinDCX CEO Sumit Gupta \"I think we can't run away from the fact that the government at least perceives this to be speculative income and the way they're trying to tax it is very much what you put in place for a speculative regime of tax,\" said Badri.  \"So that taint of cryptocurrency being associated with issues which can have an impact on national security, which does not have any basis and therefore is purely based on demand and supply, which can be manipulated, and that the large number of retail customers could potentially have issues in the event that these markets are manipulated. I think that is definitely (a perception),\" he added.  On Monday, Minister of State in Finance Ministry, Pankaj Chaudhary, clarified during the Lok Sabha session that no deductions and set-offs are available for crypto taxes.  Further, losses from transfer of one virtual digital asset (VDA) will not be allowed to be offset against income from transfer of another VDA, and the infrastructure costs incurred in mining of VDA will not be treated as cost of acquisition and, hence, will not be liable to the tax deductions.  This assumes significance as India has taken a stance which is vastly different from other countries where cryptos have gained popularity.  International tax attorney Selva Ozelli, during the panel discussion, highlighted the fact that countries like Singapore and Portugal do not impose any capital gains tax on crypto transactions, while the US treats them like investments.  \"Crypto is not any different from any other investment in that way. And India, of course, will find the right balance. They are progressive, they're going to be adopting a central bank issued digital currency. They have a flourishing crypto industry and a lot of tech brain power in India. So every country will find the best way,\" she said.

            "content": "Member of Parliament and the current Chairperson for Standing Committee on Finance, Jayant Sinha, while speaking at Business Today's Crypto Conclave today, said that the government's approach towards crypto is measured and is absolutely legal. Sinha also highlighted that globally the crypto picture is evolving at a rapid pace. In the panel along with Jayant Sinha were other legislators, such as Priyanka Chaturvedi from Shiv Sena, Pinaki Misra from BJD, and Rajeev Gowda, a former MP from Congress. All the panelists threw light on some crucial themes pertaining to the crypto industry. Talking about India's policy stance, Shiv Sena's Priyanka Chaturvedi, said, \"India is missing on the economy benefits of the crypto industry due to govt's cautious approach.\" She also added that the government has imposed taxation and brought taxation regime without disclosing its legal status. Most legislators on the panel said in unison that the government's overcautious approach is leading to a flight of talent. \"We are seeing a lot of crypto exchanges moving out of India, this should be a cause of concern for the government,\" Chaturvedi said. Concurring with Chaturvedi, Rajeev Gowda also added that the government has added a lot of confusion and he cautioned the government that this could lead to talent and institutional flight. Gowda went ahead and said that the government needs urgently a much nuanced position but, instead, it is seen talking at cross purposes. Pinaki Misra, an MP from Biju Janta Dal ,said that banning crypto now will be counterproductive and could be similar to banning the Internet. Misra said that the government sees crypto trading as a 'sinful activity', clubbing it with gambling and alcohol. Suggesting the way forward, Misra said that we have to take the best practices of all other countries and there is no denying fact that regulation is the need of the hour. Misra also suggested that the government should make a task force to decide on the future of crypto.  At last, Misra focused on the importance of industry participation in deciding the future. He said, \"Industry leaders should provide a guiding light for regulation of crypto industry and also help in creating a framework for the same.\" Gowda, highlighting the way forward, also argued that government needs to be swifter and more consultative in it's approach. He also added that we are far behind US, EU and the approach is too measured, and too slow. \"We need change in attitude. They should see it as an opportunity and not as threat, and hence bring transparency,\" he highlighted. ",

            "content": "Despite the huge tech talent pool India offers, there is a serious demand-supply gap when it comes to blockchain technologies and the country will have to find a way to address it or be swept away by the new technology, said the panelists at the Business Today Crypto Conclave 2022 in New Delhi on Tuesday.  “Out of the 2 million-odd IT skilled professionals, only 5,000 of them are blockchain professionals,” said Jagdish Mitra, Chief Growth & Strategy Officer, Tech Mahindra. We have to build our own talent pool with the help of academia because there is no ready pool outside to dip into, he added.  Highlighting the disconnect further, Rajan pointed out that the global blockchain industry is estimated to touch $3 trillion in five years. “But only one out of 400 software developers have advanced knowledge of blockchain, two out of 400 probably have rudimentary knowledge.”  ALSO READ: Crypto tax may lead to brain drain, impact trading: CoinDCX CEO Sumit Gupta Crypto advisor Ajeet Khurana added that, unlike the IT services revolution in India, crypto offers scope for a lot of non-tech jobs as well. “If you look at the crypto workforce today, 5-30 per cent is in tech (engineering and product) roles. Almost 70-90 per cent are outside. That’s the big difference.”  The panelists were unanimous that creating awareness about the field and skilling the workforce, both current and emerging, in this new technology was paramount because they expected it to play a big role as the regulations and applications around it became clearer.  ALSO READ: Govt not against blockchain, consultation on for crypto: Ravi Shankar Prasad  “Awareness is an issue. Crypto is not blockchain. A lot of clarifications are required within the industry, faculty, students and also on how careers can grow. People are reluctant sometimes to get into this space,” said Rajkumar Nehru, Shri Vishwakarma Skill Development University and Former Director, HR, Schneider Electric India.  Agreeing that a lack of awareness holds back people from getting into this field, Rajan gave the example of how well a much smaller country like Estonia uses blockchain capacities. “We are sitting on a goldmine and we just have to find a way to leverage it.”  But skilling cannot be theoretical as the industry requirements will vary depending upon on the sector in which blockchain is being applied in. “That’s where institutions need to come in and understand the needs and bake them into course modules so that students are able to crack those problems,” said Nehru, adding that outside India, most of the innovation happens in campuses.   But, he said, there is a positive trend of youngsters tying up with small-time enterprises to understand what they can do in this area as well as web and app developers cross-skilling themselves in blockchain technologies. There’s also a great opportunity in it for freelancers and gig workers, he added.   Rajan also highlighted that the biggest challenge for academia is not teaching blockchain but to meet the industry’s needs. “So, when you look at skilling, you need a combination of four things – technical skills, functional connects, sectoral knowledge and behavioural skills. This is what makes the entire dynamic that much more complex and difficult.”   Tech Mahindra’s Mitra rounded it off by saying that blockchain is a tsunami bound to happen and that roles have to be played by all and not just the government. “We have to decide whether to be a part of it. It is better to ride it than to get swept away by it.” ",

            "content": "The various provisions under the new cryptocurrency tax law, which was introduced by the government during the Budget 2022, could lead to brain drain from the country and move the trading activity from the homegrown exchanges to global platforms,  Sumit Gupta, the CEO and co-founder of cryptocurrency exchange, CoinDCX, said on Tuesday.  \nGupta, while speaking at the fireside chat themed “Cryptos: Asset or Liability?” at the Business Today Crypto Conclave, said that the “onerous tax provisions will not be good for the industry and can have serious consequences including turning away both the investors and developers away to other countries.\"\n \nWhile responding to a question from Business Today Editor, Sourav Majmudar, Gupta argued that provisions including 1 per cent tax deductible at the source (TDS), and even the recent clarifications from the government, could be disastrous for this nascent sector and prevent further innovations from developing within the country. “If you look at the countries like Dubai, Thailand, they are in the process of becoming the crypto hubs because of the positive regulations and attracting a lot of investments as well as talent from the world over. India, on the other hand, is a technology powerhouse and we should be able to harness this potential to build applications on blockchain technology if we have a favourable regulatory environment. Under the current tax provisions, the trading volumes ae expected to dry up ,” Gupta added.\n \nNeeraj Khandelwal, co-founder, CoinDCX, while drawing an analogy of the cryptocurrency development with the evolution of the Internet, said that the technology development is happening with advancement in decentralisation as was the case when world moved from wired telecommunications to the Internet age.\n \n“There are side-effects to every technology disruption, but we must focus on the positives and shouldn’t shut the technology as a whole which would put the country’s economy behind.The crypto exchanges are working on various concerns like for instance, illegal transactions which is now limited to 0.15 per cent from more than 3 per cent in 2019 as a result of more compliances and tracing tools exchanges have in place now,” Khandelwal said.\n \nOn the question of the volatility of crypto assets, Gupta said that with increasing participation of large institutional investors in the industry, and increasing market capitalisation, the volaitilty of the digital assets will go down and these will become more predictable in nature.

Subramanian was speaking on ‘Crypto Assets and Global: The Macroeconomic View' at the Business Today Crypto Conclave. \"The fear of losing monetary policy independence has to be seen in this context\" he said.  Subramanian, who was CEA between December 2018 to December 2021,  explained that the CBDC will be part of the narrow money ( existing physical currency ) and not part of the broad money (bank money or deposits ).  \"I think we have to be very careful because when you are talking about monetary policy, we are actually talking about the broad money. Broad money is created when bank give out loans,\" said Subramanian, who teaches at the Indian School of Business. ALSO READ: Are NFTs just a fad or will they shape the future? Industry insiders debate On the question of central bank giving interest on CBDC, Subramanian said that CBDC , whenever it comes , will be part of narrow money. \"This is what is my understanding. Therefore, it should be similar to existing currency. You don't earn interest on the currency today,\" he reasoned.  He also said the success or failure of the CBDC will critically depend on how secure or robust it is created. \"The temptation will certainly be there to play around with it,\" the ex-CEA cautioned.

            "content": "Non-Fungible Tokens or NFTs have a lot of hype around them lately, thanks to their exponentially growing valuations.  Digital artworks are being sold for millions of dollars, celebrities are minting NFTs to engage with their fans, movie studios are using them as a means of promotion and merchandising, but is that all there is to NFTs? Experts at the Business Today Crypto Conclave argue this is just the tip of the iceberg. “In India, 25 per cent of the Supreme Court cases and 66 per cent of all civil cases are of land disputes. Imagine if all the land records would be minted as NFTs, a lot of the court's time would be saved” said Kashif Raza, founder Bitnning and a crypto influencer.  It is noteworthy to mention that NFTs are unique tokens that are minted on the blockchain, which cannot be interchanged or tampered with. Raza also threw light on how NFTs could help the government create a source of income. “The government can buy land on Decentraland and showcase the NFTs of our monuments and artifacts for the world to see”. Ankit Wadhwa, CEO of Rario, a cricket-centric NFT marketplace, further highlighted the other use cases of NFTs. He pointed out how the very notion of NFTs are ever evolving, and with this, also evolve its use cases. “The complete ecosystem is evolving and with it the use cases are also evolving. Goods as well as their ownership has become digital. Investors can get royalties from the NFTs they own. People can play games using NFTs or use them as digital avatars,” he said.  Toshendra Sharma, CEO of NFTICALLY further added to this thread by mentioning that NFTs can also be used for ticketing. It is worth mentioning that NFTs and ticketing is already being experimented around the world by sports leagues like NBA and NFL. The NFT markets have corrected over 70 per cent as per data from Nonfungible.com. Some believe that this is a bubble set to burst but Sharma has a different opinion. He said, “This is actually good for the industry because now real innovation will take place. Now people are focussing on buying NFTs which have certain use cases, purposes, and underlying value rather than putting their money in random NFTs.” Talking about acceptance by investors, Ramkumar Subramanium, CEO of GuardianLink, another NFT marketplace, is of the opinion that just like it happened with the Internet, NFTs too will take time to be fully embraced by people, and investors. “As it happened with the Internet, as it happened with crypto, NFTs would also take some time to be fully accepted and understood by the investors,” he said. NFTs certainly are a fascinating concept of the Web3. It would be interesting to see how they pan out in the future and what their use cases might be. ",

            "content": "Former Union Minister of Law, Communication and IT, Ravi Shankar Prasad, while speaking at Business Today’s Crypto Conclave today, sounded a note of caution by saying that crypto is a disruptive technology and maximum care should be taken when walking on this ground. He also emphasised on the fundamental difference between crypto and the blockchain technology on which the former is based.  “We have never been against blockchain, in fact we encouraged blockchain technology, I think it will be and should be encouraged. I must say that blockchain is a technology and the cryptocurrency is just a part of it,” Prasad said at the conclave.  Prasad also added that the government has adopted a cautious approach and is closely monitoring the crypto space in India. “There is no big country which has made it a legal tender, India, as far as cryptocurrency is concerned, is treading with caution, and the final decision on crypto should be taken depending on if it is good or bad for the country” he added.  When asked on when the much-awaited crypto bill will see the light of day, Prasad argued that the government is still in the process of consulting and speaking to various stakeholders as far as crypto is concerned, and a decision will be made when the process reaches its logical conclusion.  “Let this stakeholder consultation happen and I think this momentum is going to pick up very soon,” he said.  The ex-minister also added that the crypto is at the same stage right now as the Internet was during the 1990s. On being asked about his stand on taxing income from digital assets, Prasad said that there is nothing wrong with the decision.  “While announcing the Budget, FM Sitharaman said we are going to encourage digital currency and the RBI also announced the whole ecosystem for it. She also said till the time we will review the cryptocurrency, we will tax the income from cryptocurrency, I don’t find anything wrong in it,” he said.  Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman, while presenting the Union Budget 2022-2023, announced a 30 per cent tax on income generated from the transfer of any digital asset. She went on to clarify that the Government of India is yet to recognise cryptocurrency. She also clarified and said: “Will come out with crypto regulations and laws only after the consultation process is completed; cannot give any timeline for the completion of the consultation on cryptos.”  Paving the way forward, Prasad highlighted the fact that there has to be a proper convergence of the best of the minds of the world on what should be a good regulation for crypto in India.

It is noteworthy to mention that El Salvador became the first country in the world to accept Bitcoin as legal tender in September 2021. The minister said during parliamentary proceedings, \"We hope the government can allow this,\" when putting forth a proposal to accept Bitcoin as legal tender. Malaysia ranks 23rd on Chainalysis' 2021 Global Crypto Adoption Index. The general population of the country is already comfortable with transacting using cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin. Malaysia is already examining the idea of a central bank digital currency. The Central Bank of Malaysia has joined a trial with the Bank for International Settlements to develop a proof of concept for their CBDC. Central bank digital currencies are essentially electronic representations of national currencies. Unlike cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin, they can be regulated and are not decentralised.

The minister of state, finance ministry, Pankaj Chaudhary clarified on Monday during the Lok Sabha session that investors will not be able to offset losses from one crypto trading pair by gains from another type. Moreover, he also mentioned that the mining infrastructure costs will not be included in the cost of acquisition to be claimed as a deduction.    Taking to Twitter on Monday, crypto exchange CoinDCX's co-founder and CEO Sumit Gupta pointed out that countries across the globe are adopting a pro-crypto approach so they can become crypto hubs and can enjoy the advantage. “India has immense potential to become a leader in the #crypto space but 30 per cent taxation may affect our chances by discouraging adoption and innovation,” he tweeted. Congress MP Karti P Chidambaram had asked the minister questions on the status of cryptocurrencies in India, in particular its legal status.

Also Read: Regressive: India's crypto sector hits out at govt's crypto tax clarifications Rohinton Sidhwa, Partner, Deloitte India, said, \"It's a continued effort to isolate and disincentivise crypto currency related activities in India. The mining expense disallowance is unlikely to impact the majority of traders, however, the prevention of offset between different cryptos will probably negatively impact many traders.\"  Similarly, WazirX's CEO Nischal Shetty argued that the recent tax clarification can discourage participation in crypto.  \"Treating profits and losses of each market pair separately will discourage crypto participation and throttle the industry's growth. It's very unfortunate, and we urge the government to reconsider this,\" he said. Ashish Singhal, co-founder and CEO, CoinSwitch, said, \"This is detrimental for India's crypto industry and the millions who have invested in this emerging asset class. We fear the lack of provision to offset losses will drive away users from KYC-compliant exchanges and platforms to the underground peer-to-peer grey market, which would defeat the purpose of the tax.\"  Singhal added, \"The Budget recognised virtual digital assets (VDAs) as an emerging asset class. Therefore, a natural course of action would have been to progressively bring the regulations at par with other asset classes. Instead, today, with this clarification, we have taken a step backwards. If a regressive provision such as this would have been applicable in equities, it would have discouraged retail investors from participating.\"  Also Read: Zomato to soon launch 'Zomato Instant' for 10-min food delivery\n  ",

As per the written reply in response to a question in Lok Sabha, the finance ministry has stated that the loss from the transfer of one VDA will not be offset (deduced) against the income from the transfer of another VDA. In addition, under the new provisions to the Income Tax Act, the infrastructure costs incurred in mining of VDA will not be treated as cost of acquisition and, hence, will not be liable to the tax deductions. The new crypto tax rules will come into effect on April 1, 2022. Meanwhile , the cryptocurrency industry has unequivocally criticised the new clarifications terming them as unfair which will impact the industry badly.

Furthermore, he quoted the Finance Bill 2022 to say that no deductions or set-offs would be allowed in any case when it comes to taxes on cryptocurrencies. It is important to point out that India has taken a somewhat tough stance when it comes to cryptocurrencies and virtual digital assets. Moreover, the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) has time and again expressed their apprehensions about crypto assets.  ",

Start-ups include Employee Stock Option Plans or (ESOPs) in their employees' compensation at the time of hiring them or during performance assessments.

When the vesting term expires, the corporation has the option of facilitating a buyback,ie buy the shares from the employees,  at which point employees may sell their shares. CoinSwitch is a global aggregator of crypto exchanges and is backed by investors like Andreessen Horowitz (a16z), Tiger Global, Sequoia Capital, Ribbit Capital, Paradigm, and Coinbase Ventures. They raised $260 million in Series C funding in September 2021 and became the country’s highest valued crypto unicorn at a valuation of $1.9 billion. Other investors include Tiger Global, Sequoia Capital, Ribbit Capital, Paradigm. It is noteworthy to mention that CoinSwitch is a16z's first investment in an Indian start-up. a16z is a venture capital founded by Marc Anderssen and Ben Horowitz.  The crypto unicorn is also Tiger Global's first investment in an Indian crypto company. The organisation has grown from 20 to 500 employees in the last two years. \"The Equity Buyback program is a small effort to acknowledge our employees' contribution to the phenomenal growth of CoinSwitch.

            "content": "   The PolygonLEAP 2021 Accelerator has announced its first cohort of 31 start-ups on Monday. The accelarator programme, which is launched by Web3 firm Polygon  in association with the innovation management firm Lumos Labs, aims at supporting and mentoring start-ups working in the Web3 space.   Web3 is often considered the next big thing when it comes to Internet and technology. It is the iteration of the Internet based on blockchain technology, which incorporates concepts such as decentralisation and token-based economics. Since the space is in its nascent stage, start-ups and companies that get a head start now would get the early movers advantage.   The Accelerator’s Incubation partner is Buidlers Tribe and investment partners include CoinDCX, Digital Finance Group, Elevation Capital,  Hashed, Jsquare, Jump Capital, Lightspeed,  Picus Capital, Sino Global Capital, and Woodstock Fund.    Sandeep Nailwal, co-founder, Polygon said, “At Polygon, we envision an open and borderless world and strive to empower budding developers to build this new world. We look forward to working with the selected startups and continue this journey of building a brighter future for Web3.”    Polygon is an Ethereum scaling solution aiming at providing cheaper transaction fees in the Ethereum blockchain.  Lumos Labs is a Singapore-based innovation management firm that specialises in running technology open innovation programs. Kaavya Prasad, co-founder, Lumos Labs said, “India ranks third in the global list of countries with the largest start-up ecosystems, right after the U.S. and U.K., and it seems like there is no stopping this growth. With this, it becomes important for the new start-ups to enter the ecosystem with all the prerequisites in order to survive. This initiative is focussed on overcoming this barrier.”    The Web3 industry has been expanding rapidly. The NFT markets have surpassed $40 billion valuation in 2021. The addressable market for metaverse is estimated at $8 trillion, and blockchain adoption in capital markets is projected to reach $27 trillion as early as 2027. Asia has been at the forefront of this emerging technology consistently. As the field of applications for blockchain grows, start-ups are continuously contributing to customising and tailoring the technology to fit multiple use cases. ",

            "content": "Australia has joined the growing list of countries considering cryptocurrency regulation, with the government ready to unveil plans for a comprehensive revamp of payment system improvements that would include digital currencies. The Australian government is going to release three crucial documents on Monday aimed at reforming the crypto industry. They would include suggestions for a new taxation structure for cryptocurrencies, rules to ensure investor protections against unscrupulous sellers, and regulations for regulating digital banks, crypto exchanges, and brokers. The government would also start consultations with industry insiders for the preparation and implementation of many of the reforms by the end of the year. It is noteworthy to mention that Australia aims at being a key player in the Web3 space and aims at incentivising innovation in the sector. Speculations are being made that the new suggested reforms would be pro crypto. Crypto taxation would also be eased in Australia to promote the country’s position as a crypto friendly nation. It's worth noting that as the Web3 wave has transformed finance and people are finding new ways to profit from crypto assets, governments across the world are taking two approaches to these new developments. On one hand, some countries are lowering taxation on crypto asset gains. South Korea's newly elected President campaigned on a vow to drastically increase the tax threshold on crypto assets. Thailand's cryptocurrency taxation policy has also recently been relaxed. Dubai has also introduced regulations to bolster the city’s stance in the Web3 revolution. On the other hand, some countries a severely taxing crypto gains and imposing strict regulations on the industry. India recently slapped a 30 per cent tax and 1 per cent TDS on crypto gains. China has also cracked down on the crypto industry by outrightly banning private mining of cryptocurrencies. Morroco, Oman, Algeria, etc. are countries with strict regulations on cryptocurrencies.

            "content": "As per a latest job opening posted by Spotify, the platform is hiring a team to integrate various features of Web3 like NFTs on its platform. Spotify is a media and music streaming service founded in Sweden. As of December 2021, it had over 406 million monthly active users, including 180 million premium clients, making it one of the largest music streaming platforms. NFTs or non-fungible tokens are non-transferable units of data that is created and stored on a blockchain. NFTs are also sold and traded on the blockchain, which is a type of digital ledger. NFT data units of various types can be associated with digital assets such as images, movies, and audio.  The music streaming platform would not be the first to integrate features of Web3 like NFTs on its platform. Microblogging website, Twitter, launched a feature to showcase NFT display pictures in January this year. Moreover, Mark Zuckerberg, CEO of Meta announced last week that Instagram, a photo and video sharing social media site, is also planning on integrating NFTs on its platform. Twitter had introduced NFTs in the form of images on its platform. Instagram would also most likely do the same and integrate NFTs as images on its platform. Since Spotify is a music streaming platform, it is most likely that Spotify might integrate NFTs in audio format on its site. This would not be the first time NFTs and music have come together. Justin Blau, Kings of Leon, Don Diablo, Jacques Greene, etc have all minted their music in the form of NFTs to ride the Web3 bandwagon. Whatever way Spotify chooses to integrate NFTs on its platform, it would be interesting to note how the users react to this new feature. Twitter had a rather successful attempt at integrating NFTs on its platform. This could be accounted by the strong NFT community on the platform. Despite decent adoption, some people did criticise Twitter's move to integrate NFTs on its platform. Elon Musk was one of the most vocal critics of this decision. ",

            "header": "Govt working on classification of cryptocurrency under GST law",
            "content": "The government is working on classification of cryptocurrency as goods or services under the GST law, so that tax can be levied on the entire value of transactions. Currently, 18% Goods and Services Tax (GST) is levied only on service provided by crypto exchanges and is categorised as financial services. GST officers are of the view that cryptos, by nature, are similar to lottery, casinos, betting, gambling, horse racing, which have 28 per cent of GST on the entire value. Besides, GST at 3 per cent is levied on the entire transaction value in case of gold. \"There is a clarity needed in regard to levy of GST on cryptocurrencies and whether it has to be levied on the entire value, We are seeing whether cryptocurrencies can be classified as goods or services and also removing any doubt on whether it can be called an actionable claim,\" an official said. Another official said that if the GST is levied on the entire transaction of cryptocurrencies then the rate could be in the range of 0.1 to 1 per cent. \"Discussions are in a nascent stage on the rate of tax, whether it would be 0.1 per cent or 1 per cent. First a decision on classification will have to be finalised and then rate will be discussed,\" the official told PTI. The Goods and Services Tax (GST) law does not clearly state about classification of cryptocurrency and in the absence of a law on regulating such virtual digital currencies, the classification has to take into account whether the legal framework classifies it as actionable claim. An actionable claim is a claim which can be made by a creditor, for any type of debt other than a debt secured by mortgage of immovable property. The 2022-23 Budget has brought in clarity with regard to levy of income tax on crypto assets. From April 1, a 30 per cent I-T plus cess and surcharges, will be levied on such transactions in the same manner as it treats winnings from horse races or other speculative transactions. The Budget 2022-23 also proposed a 1 per cent TDS on payments towards virtual currencies beyond ?10,000 in a year and taxation of such gifts in the hands of the recipient. The threshold limit for TDS would be ?50,000 a year for specified persons, which include individuals/HUFs who are required to get their accounts audited under the I-T Act. The provisions related to 1 per cent TDS will come into effect from July 1, 2022, while the gains will be taxed effective April 1. Separately, the government is working on legislation to regulate cryptocurrencies, but no draft has yet been released publicly. AMRG & Associates Senior Partner Rajat Mohan said actionable claims, other than lottery, betting and gambling are not exigible to GST. \"Private cryptocurrency can neither be termed 'money' nor be categorized as 'securities' for taxation, thereby, what remains to be checked is whether the legal framework would categorize the same as 'actionable claim' or not,\" Mohan added.

            "content": "Bored Ape Yacht Club NFT, the most valuable Non-Fungible Token collectible to date, has launched its native crypto token, ApeCoin on Thursday. The token also got listed on major exchanges like Binance, Coinbase, FTX, Huobi, OKX, and Kraken. It is noteworthy to mention that though the token is native to the BAYC universe, Yuga Labs, the creator of BAYC, has kept its distance from the launch of the token. The Securities and Exchange Council of the United States has largely been keeping its distance from NFT projects but has been diligently targetting crypto start-ups. Many experts believe that this is the reason why the new token was created by ApeCoinDAO, a decentralised autonomous organisation which is distinct from Yuga Labs. One billion ApeCoin tokens would be in circulation. 62 per cent of the total supply will go into the ecosystem fund, 14 per cent would be used for new launches. 9.75 per cent of the tokens will go to BAYC Yuga Labs, 8 per cent will go to Yuga Labs founders, and 6.25 per cent will go to the Jane Goodall Foundation, a charity dedicated to protecting chimpanzee habitats. The ApeCoin team announced that the token will be the “primary token for any future products and services” that Yuga Labs develops. This includes a play-to-earn (P2E) blockchain game that Yuga Labs hopes to release later this year with game developer nWay. ApeCoin will also be utilised in Animoca Brands' new play-to-earn game Benji Bananas, which also owns nWay. Since its debut in April last year, Bored Ape Yacht Club has become one of the most sought-after NFT collections. Last week, Yuga Labs bought two more major NFT projects, CryptoPunks and Meebits, further consolidating its market domination. BAYC is one of the most expensive NFT collectibles, ranging anything from $200,000 to $3 million. This collection features still images of Apes and it exists on the Ethereum blockchain.

Bitbns Academy would be an online education platform offering tutorials, resources and educational content on cryptocurrency and blockchain.  The exchange also announced in the release that Bitbns Academy would offer globally accredited certified courses. The courses would have three difficulty stages: beginner, intermediate and advanced and users would be able to access them for free after registering with the Bitbns platform. Crypto and Web3 education has become the need of the hour for India because India is one of the fastest-growing markets for cryptocurrency trading. It is important for retail investors in India to fathom the risk and volatility of crypto markets. Gaurav Dahake, CEO, Bitbns, said, “Bitbns Academy offers a robust curriculum that has been tailored to decrypt several technical concepts while offering an in-depth understanding of cryptocurrency and blockchain technology.” On this new partnership with Bitbns, Nitesh Khandelwal, CEO, QuantInsti, said, “In lines with our mission to up-skill investors and traders, we are excited to partner with Bitbns to empower crypto enthusiasts with the essential knowledge required to make smart trading decisions” This is not the first time crypto exchanges have launched initiatives to educate the community. Binance launched the Binance Academy in 2018 to educate and certify amateur traders. Coinbase has also launched a similar initiative called Coinbase Learn. Moreover, recently, CoinDCX launched an initiative to promote blockchain literacy in partnership with BITS Pilani. ",

Zhao made this announcement at EthereumRio, a community gathering for Ethereum hosted in Brazil's Rio de Janeiro. He announced that the business is planning to expand its 100-person staff in Brazil. Binance is the largest cryptocurrency exchange in the world in terms of trading volume. The exchange also announced on Monday that it had signed a Memorandum of Understanding (MoU) to acquire Brazilian securities brokerage Simpaul Investimentos. According to Zhao, the exchange intends to collaborate closely with regulators and government organisations to determine how to foster the growth of the cryptocurrency industry \"in a healthy and collaborative way.\" Zhao has also met Brazillian politicians on his recent trip to Brazil. Brazil introduced a framework to legalise cryptocurrencies in the country in late February this year. Brazil's new legislation would compel crypto exchanges to obtain legal authorisation, which may be accomplished by the establishment of a local office or the acquisition of an existing operator. Changpeng Zhao, CEO of Binance, announced last week that the company intends to also acquire additional companies in non-crypto industries in order to broaden the appeal of digital assets. It is also noteworthy to mention that Binance received a license to operate in Bahrain earlier this week.  Recently, Binance became the second crypto exchange to receive a license to operate in Dubai. FTX exchange was the first to receive the license from Dubai's new crypto regulatory authority. ",

It marks a ratcheting up of direct warnings to consumers about crypto assets by EU authorities, spelling out that consumers have no protections or recourse to compensation under existing EU financial services law. Regulators are increasingly worried that more consumers are buying 17,000 different crypto assets, including bitcoin and ether, which account for 60% of the market, without being fully aware of the risks, the regulators said. \"Consumers should be alert to the risks of misleading advertisements, including via social media and influencers. Consumers should be particularly wary of promised fast or high returns, especially those that look too good to be true,\" the statement said. Consumers should also be aware of that energy consumption for producing some crypto assets is high and the environmental impact this has, the statement said. ",

            "content": "Ukraine's President Volodymyr Zelenskyy has signed a bill legalising cryptocurrency into law amid a flurry of digital asset donations to fund Ukraine's struggle against the Russian invasion. Ukraine has received over $100 million in crypto donations so far. According to a statement released by the Ministry of Digital Transformation of Ukraine on Wednesday, the law outlines the legal status, classification, ownership, and regulators of virtual assets, as well as registration requirements for crypto service providers. The statement clarified that the crypto assets market would be supervised by Ukraine's National Commission on Securities and the Stock Market. Moreover, confirming the news in a tweet, the Ministry of Digital Transformation of Ukraine stated that exchanges will be permitted to operate legally and banks will issue accounts for them.   It is noteworthy to mention that the country has been trying to legalise cryptocurrencies since September 2021. President Zelenskky rejected the September 2021 version of the bill. The Parliament then passed a different version of the bill in February this year which he approved on Wednesday. Ukraine has received over $100 million in crypto donations over the previous three weeks to support its struggle against the Russian invasion. The country's finance ministry is reportedly working on adjustments to the country's tax and civil legislation in order to completely open the market for virtual assets.  ",

Bitcoin is up by 3.58 per cent and is trading at $41,063, while Ethereum is also up by 4.73 per cent and is trading at $2,770. However, the stablecoins showed a slight downtrend. The USDT Tether stable coin fell by 0.01 per cent in the last 24 hours. The USDC stable coin is also down by 0.01 per cent.  The BNB token has also risen with all the tokens and is currently up by 2.61 per cent. XRP Ripple showed upward movement and is now up by 3.42 per cent. Terra LUNA tanked by 0.80 per cent in the last 24 hours.  The ADA token is up by 4.26 per cent. Solana and Avalanche are also up by 6.69 per cent and 9.86 per cent respectively. It is noteworthy to mention that the US Federal Reserve raised interest rates for the first time since 2018, from 0.25 per cent to 0.5 per cent to combat the rising inflation rate.  “In most cases, the rise of interest rates tends to signal uncertainty for the crypto market as investors have greater access to yield from low-risk avenues of the market. Yet, in contrast, the past 24 hours have witnessed the crypto market responding atypically, trending further upwards to continue its bullish trend in the greens,\" the CoinDCX research team said. ",

In that regard, we're very excited to partner with MAD Influence to make this future a reality.
