            "content": "UK MPs have invited Elon Musk to parliament so they can quiz him about his planned purchase of Twitter. The Commons Digital, Culture, Media and Sport Committee said it wanted to hear more about the billionaire's plans to balance \"free speech\" with \"obligations to protect Twitter's users\". There are concerns Mr Musk has plans to relax content rules, which critics say could increase hate speech on the site. But others have welcome his commitment to protect freedom of expression. In a letter to the Tesla boss, committee chair Julian Knight said the MPs supported Mr Musk's commitments to remove all spam accounts and automated bots from Twitter. \"In particular, your intention to roll out verification for all users echoes our calls on the UK government as part of proposed legislation, which we hope will restore the UK public's trust in digital platforms,\" the Conservative MP wrote. \"I therefore wish to take this opportunity to invite you to speak before our committee and discuss your proposals in more depth,\" he added. \"I know you have expressed your wish that critics remain on Twitter and this may present an opportunity to address any critiques in public.\" The BBC is not responsible for the content of external sites.\nView original tweet on Twitter In a further statement, Mr Knight said the committee was keen \"learn more about how Mr Musk will balance his clear commitment to free speech with new obligations to protect Twitter's users from online harms\". \"Appearing before the committee will give Mr Musk an ideal opportunity to set out his proposals for Twitter in more depth and we would look forward to welcoming him,\" he said. Mr Musk agreed a $44bn (£34.5bn) takeover deal with the Twitter board last month, and said at the time that as well as improving the free speech principles of the site, he was looking forward to \"enhancing the product with new features\". As well as improving verification, the SpaceX boss has suggested cutting the price of the Twitter Blue subscription service and wants to bring in a tool to edit already posted tweets. On Monday at the annual Met Gala in New York, he also said he would make Twitter transparent about how tweets are promoted or demoted and wanted its software to be available for public scrutiny. But critics, largely on the political left, have warned that the billionaire's support of absolute free speech could allow hate speech to flourish. They also fear that suspended accounts, such as that of former US President Donald Trump, could be reinstated. The BBC is not responsible for the content of external sites.\nView original tweet on Twitter Separately, Mr Musk said on Tuesday that business and government users of Twitter may need to pay a \"slight\" fee to stay on the social media platform in future. However, he said the site would always be free for \"casual users\". Earlier, the billionaire had tweeted a link to a CNN story which called for top brands to boycott Twitter if Mr Musk rolls back content moderation policies limiting hate speech. Twitter did not immediately respond to a BBC request for comment. Elon Musk sells $8.5bn worth of Tesla shares\nTwitter adds users as it gears up for Musk takeover\nWho is Elon Musk? Meanwhile, Mr Musk has reportedly told potential investors that he may return the social media firm to the stock market in just a few years. Mr Musk plans to sell Twitter shares again as little as three years after buying it, according to the Wall Street Journal, which cited people familiar with the matter. His takeover of the company is expected to be completed later this year, subject to conditions including the approval of Twitter's shareholders and regulators. Under the deal he will buy all the shares in the company that are currently available on the stock market, taking it from being a publicly-owned company to a private one. Mr Musk is the world's richest person, with an estimated net worth of around $250bn, mostly due to his Tesla stake. He also has a controlling stake in the rocket company SpaceX, which is estimated to be worth $100bn. ",

            "header": "Ukraine conflict: What is Swift and why is banning Russia so significant?",
            "content": "The European Commission has proposed excluding three more Russian banks from Swift, an international payment system used by thousands of financial institutions. It comes after the EU and its allies suspended seven institutions from the system in March. The move aims to hit the country's banking network and its access to funds via Swift, which is pivotal for the smooth transaction of money worldwide. Swift is the global financial artery that allows the smooth and rapid transfer of money across borders. It stands for Society for Worldwide Interbank Financial Telecommunication. Created in 1973 and based in Belgium, Swift links 11,000 banks and institutions in more than 200 countries. But Swift is not your traditional High Street bank. It is a sort of instant messaging system that informs users when payments have been sent and arrived. What sanctions are being imposed on Russia? It sends more than 40 million messages a day, as trillions of dollars change hands between companies and governments. More than 1% of those messages were thought to involve Russian payments. In March, seven Russian banks were removed from Swift including Bank Otkritie, Novikombank, Promsvyazbank, Bank Rossiya, Sovcombank, Vnesheconombank (VEB) and VTB Bank. The European Commission now wants to exclude a further three including the country's biggest lender, Sberbank, which accounts for more than a third of Russia's banking sector. The package still has to be approved by EU ambassadors and is set to be signed off in the next few days. The EU, US, UK and others have said that cutting banks out of Swift will ensure they \"are disconnected from the international financial system and harm their ability to operate globally\". The aim is for Russian companies to lose access to the normal smooth and instant transactions provided by Swift, disrupting payments for its valuable energy and agricultural exports. Banks now have to deal directly with one another, adding delays and extra costs, and ultimately cutting off revenues for the Russian government. Russia was threatened with a Swift expulsion before - in 2014 when it annexed Crimea. Russia said the move would be tantamount to a declaration of war. Western allies did not go ahead, but the threat did prompt Russia to develop its own, very fledgling, cross-border transfer system called the System for Transfer of Financial Messages (SPFS) as an alternative to Swift. Few foreign countries currently use SPFS, but India is reportedly considering a Russian proposal to use it for payments in roubles. Separately, Moscow is working with Beijing to connect to China's Cross-Border Interbank Payment System (CIPS) - another alternative to Swift which processes payments in Chinese yuan. Some nations - such as Germany, France and Italy - were initially reluctant to take action against Russia's use of Swift. There were concerns that companies owed money by Russia would have to find alternative ways to get paid. There were also fears it could impact the global banking system, although there is no evidence of this yet. Alexei Kudrin, Russia's former finance minister, has suggested being cut off from Swift could shrink Russia's economy by 5%. However, there are doubts about the lasting impact on Russia's economy, particularly if banks find sustainable ways to reroute payments via countries that have not imposed sanctions. Swift was created by American and European banks, which did not want a single institution developing their own system and having a monopoly. The network is now jointly-owned by more than 2,000 banks and financial institutions. It is overseen by the National Bank of Belgium, in partnership with major central banks around the world - including the US Federal Reserve and the Bank of England. Swift helps make secure international trade possible for its members, and is not supposed to take sides in disputes. However, Iran was banned from Swift in 2012, as part of sanctions over its nuclear programme. It lost almost half of its oil export revenues and 30% of foreign trade. Swift says it has no influence over sanctions and any decision to impose them rests with governments. ",

            "content": "The PM yesterday said that fears of an \"inflationary spiral\" had held back the amount of support the government could offer in the cost of living crisis. This is a tricky concept to explain to millions of people seeing the energy bill direct debits more than double, and take home pay fall after national insurance rises. Indeed the more basic direction of causation would be the other way - lower energy price rises mean lower rates of inflation. The logic is not new. The Treasury made the same point in a letter in December underpinning its approach to pay for public sector workers, saying rises could \"contribute to higher wage demands across the country\". What has changed is that long term interest rates are starting to rise now, not just for the government, but also for businesses and home owners with a mortgage. People face biggest living standards drop since 1956\nSunak accused of not doing enough for poorest\nWhy are prices rising so quickly? The fear of an \"inflationary spiral\" is that these rises will start to accelerate. Short term interest rates set by the Bank of England are now expected to hit 2.5-3%, continuing tomorrow, as the Bank tries to grapple with inflation exceeding 8 or 9%. And yet at this very same moment, economists are starting to forecast the same cost of living crisis beginning to send the economy into reverse. There is no rocket science here. What could reach £40 billion worth of consumer energy cost hikes, the equivalent of an 8p rise on the basic rate of tax, has been only fractionally mitigated by government support. This money is coming straight out of household disposable income at the same time as tax rises. This puts real consumer spending power on course to fall by the most seen since the 1940s - in just one year. The confidence of UK consumers in the economy and their finances is suffering. The five-decade old market research firm GfK's survey found customer confidence to have fallen to one of its lowest levels since 1974. In the current three month period of April to the end of June, some economists fear zero growth in the size of the economy, or even a fall, after taking into account the extra Jubilee Bank Holiday. Recession risks are rising, even as rates are rising too. This is the \"narrow path\" the Governor of the Bank of England says his institution has to tread in the coming months, as both growth and inflation are sent in the wrong direction, at precisely the same time. But it is a path that could force British households even further away from their normal course. ",

            "content": "Brewdog boss James Watt has set out plans to give away nearly a fifth of his equity stake to the firm's staff. Mr Watt owns a quarter of the fast-growing Aberdeenshire-based beer maker. Brewery and pub workers have criticised him over his behaviour and pressure on them to grow the firm rapidly. At least partly in response, Mr Watt has set out an incentive plan which also means half of its pub profits will go to those who work on hourly rates in its 111 bars worldwide. Based on last year's figures, that could mean an annual bonus of between £3,000 and £5,000 each, in cash payouts made twice a year. Brewdog chief accused of inappropriate behaviour\nBrewdog flouted US laws over beer imports\nBrewdog boss sorry for staff 'pain' as vows review The chief executive claimed the giveaway of shares could be worth £120,000 for each Brewdog salaried staffer, comprising four annual tranches starting this June. However, the shares are not yet tradeable, and plans to float shares on the stock exchange have been delayed. A funding round in 2017 brought in an investment fund, TSG, with a £213m injection of capital, but on terms that financial analysts said stood to undermine the value of other shareholders. James Watt currently holds 24.2% of the company, and the plan unveiled on Monday - to mark 15 years since it started brewing - is for him to give away 5% to an Employee Benefit Trust, reducing his stake to 19.2%. That trust will distribute equally across salaried staff, at around 1.25% of the company each year. Anyone who leaves the company ahead of shares being floated on the stock exchange will have to give up the option to buy shares, which will then revert to the trust. At current rates of turnover, the 5% stake will take up to eight years for the trust to distribute. Between staff and the 'Equity Punks' who took part in several successful rounds of crowdfunding, a quarter of the company should be owned by small-scale shareholders once this process is complete. The rewards package, unusually, extends to former members of staff, including some who were particularly outspoken about Mr Watt's behaviour and the pressures they were under. Ex-employees will get discounts on Brewdog products and in its bars, and will be able to join an alumni club. Management was accused by former workers last summer of having a \"culture of fear\" within the business, with \"toxic attitudes\" towards junior staff. A group of 60 employees published an open letter alleging the business was built upon a \"cult of personality\" around its founders, James Watt and Martin Dickie, with \"growth at all costs\" the overarching focus of the company. Further revelations came to light in an investigation by BBC Scotland journalists. Mr Watt said the group had already made changes after the open letter was published, stressing the employee reward scheme was not about mending relationships with employees, but \"building the best company we possibly can\". \"Everything we're doing today is about looking forward with a fantastic team,\" he said. He said Brewdog wanted to be a \"new type of business\", and that shared ownership would help with recruitment, retention and team engagement. \"We want our team members to act as business owners and incentivise them as if they are business owners,\" he added. Mr Watt said the group was unlikely to float in the next 12 months given the market uncertainty, but said a listing was \"very much part\" part of the plan in the medium term. Brewdog was founded in Fraserburgh by James Watt and his friend and fellow beer-lover Martin Dickie, as a challenger to conventional beer. It expanded rapidly with a move to a new brewery in Ellon, where it is currently expanding its capacity. Other Brewdog breweries have been built in Ohio, Brisbane and Berlin. It operates 111 bars around the world, with three hotels, and in Ellon it is expanding into spirits distillation. ",

            "content": "Some energy suppliers have been given a three-week deadline to explain accusations they have increased customers' direct debit payments by \"more than is necessary\". Jonathan Brearley, boss of the energy regulator Ofgem, recently said there were \"troubling signs\" of the tactic. He also expressed concern over customers being directed to inappropriate deals. Official reviews have now been launched. Mr Brearley had said in April that reviews were imminent, but the development emerged from an update published on Twitter by Business Secretary Kwasi Kwarteng. The BBC is not responsible for the content of external sites.\nView original tweet on Twitter Mr Kwarteng said that some energy companies had been increasing direct debits beyond what was required. \"I can confirm Ofgem has today issued compliance reviews,\" Mr Kwarteng's tweet went on. \"The regulator will not hesitate to swiftly enforce compliance, including issuing substantial fines.\" However, by reviewing the issue, Ofgem has yet to draw a firm conclusion on whether any rules have been broken. An Ofgem spokesperson said: \"Our top priority is to protect consumers and we recently wrote to suppliers to alert them that we are commissioning a series of market compliance reviews to ensure, amongst other things, that they are handling direct debits fairly, and that overall, they are held to higher standards for performance on customer service and protecting vulnerable customers.\" A spokesman for Energy UK, which represents energy companies, said: \"Suppliers are required to set [direct debits] at a fair and reasonable level based on the customer's individual circumstances, taking into account factors like previous energy use or record with previous payments. \"It is right that the regulator is looking to ensure that suppliers are complying with those requirements. Customers who do have concerns with the level of their direct debit payments should contact their supplier.\" Prime Minister Boris Johnson had earlier acknowledged \"there is more that we can do\" to help families struggling with rising fuel and energy bills. Opposition parties have called for a windfall tax on energy company profits, with Labour accusing him of offering \"no answers\" to a \"cost of living crisis\". On 1 April, yearly bills increased by an average of £693 for about 18 million households on standard tariffs. And some 4.5 million prepayment customers saw an average increase of £708 - from £1,309 to £2,017. Mr Brearley, chief executive of Ofgem, wrote in a blog on Ofgem's website in April that the regulator had received information from consumer groups and the public about \"bad practices\" by some suppliers. \"We are also seeing troubling signs that some companies are reacting to these changes by allowing levels of customer service to deteriorate,\" he wrote. He added that they were also concerned about \"the way some vulnerable customers are being treated when they fall into difficulties\". The regulator has powers to issue \"substantial fines\" of up to 10% of turnover to firms found failing to comply. ",

The ferry operator says it is operating a reduced timetable on Tuesday, with a normal timetable resuming on Wednesday. The Spirit of Britain is the only ferry in service on the route so tickets are limited. It comes after P&O sacked almost 800 seafarers in March to replace them with cheaper agency workers. Tuesday marks the first time that drive-on passengers and tourists will have been able to use the service in almost six weeks. The Spirit of Britain will leave Dover for Calais at 16:05. It has been crossing the English channel for just under a week, carrying freight-only traffic. It is the only ship the company can currently use for its cross-Channel operations and was cleared to sail on 22 April after being detained 11 days earlier, when 23 failures were found by Maritime and Coastguard Agency (MCA) inspectors. Dover to Calais P&O ferry cleared to sail\nP&O Ferries hits back at new staff pay cut claim The MCA has confirmed that the Pride of Kent, which also operates on the Dover-Calais route, has failed its reinspection. After reinspection, the MCA said not all of the previously identified issues around safety and crew documentation had been put right, so it will remain under detention. It will reinspect the vessel when next requested to do so by P&O Ferries. The company used to have four ferries in operation on this route, so it is still below its normal operating capacity. The other two ferries, the Pride of Canterbury and the Spirit of France, are still out of action. P&O Ferries was widely condemned by politicians, trade unions and the public after replacing nearly 800 crew members with cheaper agency staff on 17 March. It suspended most of its operations following the decision, with delays and increased traffic seen around the Port of Dover as a result around the Easter holidays. When P&O Ferries sacked its staff, the company said the move was to ensure the future of the business. Passenger services have already resumed on its three other UK routes, which are between Liverpool and Dublin, Ireland; between Cairnryan, Scotland and Larne, Northern Ireland; and between Hull and Rotterdam, the Netherlands. Last week, another P&O Ferries ship spent hours adrift without power in the Irish Sea. P&O said the incident was caused by a \"temporary mechanical issue\" that had been resolved. The European Causeway ferry was ordered to remain at Larne Port until it passes another inspection. ",

            "header": "BP profits soar as calls for windfall tax grow",
            "content": "BP's profits for the first three months of this year have more than doubled after oil and gas prices soared. The energy giant reported an underlying profit of $6.2bn (£4.9bn) compared to $2.6bn in the same period last year - ahead of expectations. BP said the increase was due in part to \"exceptional oil and gas trading\". Rising profits have prompted calls for a one-off windfall tax on energy companies to help UK households grappling with rising bills. This type of charge targets firms that are lucky enough to benefit from something they were not responsible for - in other words, a windfall. BP's profits have been driven by a sharp rise in oil prices, initially led by increased demand as economies reopened following Covid lockdowns. Last November, BP chief Bernard Looney described the energy market as \"a cash machine\". Oil prices rose further after war broke out in Ukraine and western countries imposed sanctions on Russia following its invasion. Russia is the second biggest exporter of crude oil, and is also the world's largest natural gas exporter. UK inflation is currently at its highest rate for 30 years, lifted by the rising cost of oil and gas which has inflated fuel prices as well as the cost of household energy. Energy prices: What is a windfall tax and how would it work? Labour leader Sir Keir Starmer told the BBC that BP's profits - which beat analysts' expectations of $4.5bn - \"reinforce the case that we've been making which is that, with so many people struggling to pay their energy bills, we should have a windfall tax on oil and gas companies in the North Sea who have made more profit than they were expecting\". Italy has said it will increase its tax on energy companies' windfall profits from 10% to 25%, but the UK government is not in favour of such a charge. Prime Minister Boris Johnson said a windfall tax would hamper investment and keep oil prices higher over the long term. He told ITV: \"If you put a windfall tax on the energy companies, what that means is that you discourage them from making the investments that we want to see that will, in the end, keep energy prices lower for everybody.\" Liberal Democrat leader Ed Davey said energy companies should \"pay a little more to help the most vulnerable\". \"The Conservative government's refusal to introduce a windfall tax on the super profits of oil companies is becoming impossible to justify,\" he said. \"BP is raking in eye-watering profits while millions of people struggle to pay the bills.\" Chancellor Rishi Sunak has previously said he would explore a windfall tax policy if companies did not invest enough in the UK's energy supply. On Tuesday, BP announced plans to invest £18bn in green and fossil fuel operations in the UK by the end of the decade. But it also said it would buy back another $2.5bn of its shares and keep dividends - payments to shareholders - at 5.46 cents a share. BP says it expects to pay £1bn in taxes for its 2022 North Sea profits, on top of around £250m that it has paid annually in other taxes in the UK in recent years. Mr Looney said: \"We're backing Britain. It's been our home for over 110 years, and we've been investing in North Sea oil and gas for more than 50 years. \"We're fully committed to the UK's energy transition - providing reliable home-grown energy and, at the same time, focusing on the drive to net zero.\" BP's promise to invest £18bn in UK over the remainder of this decade and its estimate it will pay about a billion pounds in UK tax this year seems to have headed off the threat of being hit by a windfall tax. While the £18bn figure is just totting up investments already planned, it is a larger proportion of their global investment than in previous years. While the final decision on tax is the chancellor's, the investment was welcomed by the business secretary and the prime minister again played down talk of a swoop on oil and gas profits. Opposition parties are not convinced and pointed to BP's target of using 60% of excess profits to buy back shares and the rest to pay down debt. With Shell expected to post even higher profit numbers later this week, the debate is sure to continue. Russ Mould from investment platform AJ Bell said it was \"no surprise\" to hear BP pledging billions of pounds worth of investment in projects to boost domestic energy security. \"Whether this will be enough to stave off a new levy remains to be seen. The political pressure to do so is only likely to escalate as the cost of living continues to surge in the UK,\" he said. Nick Butler, a former vice president at BP, told the BBC's Today programme it was possible the government would impose a greater tax burden on the energy giant. The visiting professor at Kings College London said: \"I think the company can answer that by showing that they are actually contributing to energy security.\" BP said it had taken a $24.4bn hit on its decision to exit its shareholding in Russian energy giant Rosneft following the Kremlin's assault on Ukraine. Including the cost of exiting its 19.75% shareholding in Rosneft, BP reported a loss of $20.3bn for the first quarter. \"In a quarter dominated by the tragic events in Ukraine and volatility in energy markets, BP's focus has been on supplying the reliable energy our customers need,\" said Mr Looney. He added that the oil market would continue to be volatile and he did not expect \"any let off on prices any time soon\". Rival energy giant Shell is scheduled to report its results for the first quarter of the year on Thursday. ",

            "header": "The perfect storm increasing the cost of a crucial metal",
            "content": "In the next few years, millions of people will buy electric vehicles (EVs). All those cars and trucks will run on batteries containing metals such as cobalt, lithium and nickel. But shortages of metals could potentially hobble the EV boom. \"Not a lot of people realise, we simply do not have enough of these critical materials at the moment mined around the world,\" says Megan O'Connor, chief executive and co-founder of battery materials mining and recycling firm, Nth Cycle. Her company has designed a means of extracting nickel and other metals from minced-up old batteries - so that these materials can be used again. It's called electro-extraction and it works by using an electrical current to separate metals out from crushed up battery waste known as \"black mass\". The separated metals are isolated and trapped in a special filter. Nth Cycle's technology extracts nickel, not just from pulverised old batteries, but also from the clumps of rock and metals dug out of mines. It's potentially a more sustainable method of recovering nickel than traditional techniques such as pyrometallurgy, which Dr O'Connor says is not an environmentally-friendly process. \"Think of it like a big furnace, they melt everything at very high temperatures - you can imagine the carbon footprint,\" she explains. In the coming years, industry will need all the supplies of nickel it can get as its integral to so many of the products we use daily. Lithium ion batteries, which power many devices, including your phone, rely on a mix of nickel, manganese and cobalt. But in some batteries, nickel is by far the largest component, representing 80% of the mix. The problem is that sourcing nickel, like many materials at the moment, is subject to supply chain headaches caused in part by the war in Ukraine, as Russia is one of the world's biggest nickel suppliers. Countries such as Indonesia and the Philippines, will likely boost their nickel output as buyers search for non-Russian sources of the metal. Although there are questions over how sustainable this new production will be. Dr O'Connor argues that new mines will not be able to open quickly enough to satisfy rising demand for nickel, which is also used to make stainless steel and wind turbine components. Instead, recycling old batteries will help to \"patch\" that supply problem, she suggests. Other companies are also taking this approach, with Redwood Materials in the US already acquiring batteries from the equivalent of between 60-80,000 electric vehicles every year. \"We recover, on average, 95% of the elements from batteries, like nickel, cobalt, lithium and copper,\" says vice president for communications and government relations, Alexis Georgeson. But general confidence in the nickel market is yet to return after a difficult episode in March, when nickel's price on the London Metal Exchange (LME) spiked by 250% before falling again. That prompted the LME's operators to suspend trading of nickel for about a week - a more or less unprecedented move. \"It was a disaster,\" says Keith Wildie, head of trading at metals recycling firm Romco Group, who notes that the price of nickel remains volatile. Although it has fallen again, the price is still around 60% higher than it was at the beginning of the year. The price shock happened partly because a Chinese firm, Tsingshan Holding Group, had built up a large \"short position\" in the market - in other words, arranging contracts that bet the price of nickel would fall. When it didn't, the firm was forced to buy back those contracts, or commit to supplying the nickel. Taking either option would result in a huge loss. The company did not respond to a BBC request for comment. Disruption and panic on the market has subsequently knocked nickel traders' confidence, adds Mr Wildie: \"The volumes have absolutely collapsed.\" Both the Financial Conduct Authority and the Bank of England have announced reviews into the incident. In a statement, the LME said, \"The LME is committed to ensuring that the actions of all participants… are fully reviewed, and appropriate actions taken to both restore confidence and support the long-term health and efficiency of the market.\" However, there were concerns about future supplies of nickel, even before this episode unfolded. EV maker Tesla, for example, had already moved to secure access to the metal by becoming a technical partner in a new nickel mine on the Pacific island of New Caledonia. More technology of business: Scooter recall hits India's 'Tesla of two-wheelers'\nWill Taiwan's banks stay stuck in the '1980s'?\nWhy Argentina is embracing cryptocurrency\nWhat are people doing to cut heating bills?\nWhy these are boom times for Indian actors Not all firms can take this option. More than two-thirds of the world's nickel production goes to the stainless steel industry, where it ultimately ends up in everything from cutlery to bathroom taps and washing machines. Some stainless steel factories in Europe have already cut production, thanks to nickel pricing and supply concerns. Although Lisa Reisman, founder and executive editor of trade publication MetalMiner, predicts that short term demand for the metal in some industries could fall. High interest rates might lead to a slowdown of the housing market, which would likely mean fewer people may purchasing new appliances containing stainless steel in the coming months, she explains. Electric cars will almost certainly require a steady supply of nickel, though. Earlier this year, market research firm S&P Global Platts forecasted that light duty EV sales worldwide would reach 26.8 million by 2030. The firm noted that EV sales more than doubled between 2020 and 2021. Jason Sappor, senior analyst at S&P Global Platts, says the elevated price of nickel probably won't have a major impact on EV sales. But he does say that EV batteries are becoming an increasingly important driver of the nickel market. Could recycling old batteries help fill the gap, as Dr O'Connor suggests? Maybe, says Mr Sappor - but it requires getting access to enough old batteries to make extracting the small amounts of nickel inside them worthwhile. \"The one issue with that is that there needs to be the existing stock to recycle from,\" he says. This approach does make sense, he adds, \"in the long run\". Dr O'Connor stresses that recycling alone won't be enough to satisfy our nickel needs in the foreseeable future: \"We need to start mining more of these materials - and mining them more sustainably.\" ",

            "header": "Law firm says staff can work from home - for 20% less pay",
            "content": "A London law firm has offered staff the option to work from home permanently, but the convenience comes at a price. The firm, Stephenson Harwood, said it would allow staff to work remotely but pay them 20% less than their current salary. Since the start of the pandemic a debate has raged over who gains and who loses when staff work from home. Employees save time and money, but employers can save too, on office space and costs. Some argue workers are less productive when unsupervised at home. Others say without the commute they work longer hours, often spilling over into evenings and weekends and face fewer distractions. Most recently cabinet office minister Jacob Rees-Mogg sparked controversy when he said all civil servants must stop working from home. and left notes on empty desks saying \"I look forward to seeing you in the office very soon.\" Academic studies suggest remote working can boost productivity. And many private sector firms have found that hybrid working, allowing a combination of home and office work, frees up space and improves staff satisfaction. Hybrid working is here to stay, say managers\n'We get more done in the office'\nRees-Mogg empty desk note insulting, says union Stephenson Harwood told the BBC that it had recruited some remote workers from outside London during the pandemic, on a lower pay package, reflecting the lower cost of not commuting into the capital. But if they do need to go to the office remote workers could claim travel expenses, he said. The firm is now extending the remote working option to existing staff, but also applying the salary difference between the two packages, the firm said. The choice of full-time remote working is available to all employees but not to partners in the firm. Stephenson Harwood said it didn't expect many people to take up the offer to work remotely full-time. A newly qualified lawyer, for example, starts on a salary of £90,000, at the law firm. But the chance of them choosing to take £72,000 instead to work from home were \"very slim\" as their role required experience of the office environment, he said. The spokesman said the firm's current policy, where people can choose to work from home for up to two days a week, suited many of its 1,100 employees across offices in London, Paris, Greece, Hong Kong, Singapore and South Korea. \"For the vast majority of our people, our hybrid working policy works well,\" he told law firm news website RollOnFriday which first reported the story. Stanford University academic Nicholas Bloom estimates that post-pandemic about 10% of employees will work fully remotely. He argues that homeworking could boost productivity, narrow regional inequalities and help blue-collar workers win more flexibility. However, some firms are encountering resistance to a return to the office, even on a hybrid basis. A handful of Apple staff have reportedly told boss Tim Cook his plan for them to work from the office three days a week will make the company \"younger, whiter and more male-dominated\". In an open letter they said a compulsory return to the office \"will change the makeup of our workforce\" and \"lead to privileges deciding who can work for Apple, not who'd be the best fit.\" It said the office would be made up of staff who lived nearby, young people without family commitments and parents who had a stay-at-home partner. The letter has around 200 signatures, just 0.1% of the firm's 165,000 staff. It came in response to an email from Mr Cook which said returning to the office was \"a positive sign that we can engage more fully with the colleagues who play such an important role in our lives\". Mr Cook said he was \"deeply committed\" to giving his staff support and flexibility. ",

            "content": "The European Commission has accused Apple of abusing its market position for contactless smartphone payments. In a preliminary finding, it said the US company may have broken competition law by preventing rivals from accessing its \"tap and go\" technology. Apple denies the charge and has promised to engage with the Commission. If the charges are upheld, it could be fined up to 10% of its global turnover of $36.6bn (£29.2bn) based on its revenue last year. \"We have indications that Apple restricted third-party access to key technology necessary to develop rival mobile wallet solutions on Apple's devices,\" EU Vice-President Margrethe Vestager said in a statement. \"We preliminarily found that Apple may have restricted competition, to the benefit of its own solution Apple Pay,\" the EU official who is in charge of competition policy said. According to the Commission, this behaviour from Apple has an \"exclusionary effect\" on competitors and \"leads to less innovation and less choice for consumers for mobile wallets on iPhones\". In response, the tech giant said its payment system was only one of many options available to European consumers. It added that it had \"ensured equal access\" to mobile payment technology, while \"setting industry-leading standards\" for privacy and security.

The Commission also accused Apple anti-competitive practices dating back to 2015 when it launched Apple Pay. More than 2,500 banks in Europe use Apple Pay and Apple smartphones represent around a third of the market across Europe. Next year, the EU plans to implement new rules for technology firms, detailed in its Digital Markets Act.

            "content": "Qantas has announced it will begin operating non-stop flights from Sydney to London and New York from 2025. Australia's national carrier said it had purchased a new fleet of Airbus A350-1000 jets capable of direct flights to any city in the world. The first Sydney-London flights will depart in late 2025 and take about 20 hours, making them the world's longest passenger flights. The route, launched in 1947, once took 58 hours and seven stops. \"It's the last frontier and the final fix for the tyranny of distance,\" chief executive Alan Joyce said in a statement. Qantas has been working on the plan - dubbed Project Sunrise - for about five years, but implementation has been delayed by the Covid-19 pandemic. In 2018 it began offering direct 17-hour direct flights between London and Perth in Western Australia, and in 2019 it conducted a series of test flights from the east coast to the UK and New York. How UK-Australia travel evolved to one flight\nCan long-haul air travel also be low cost? The new fleet of 12 planes will begin arriving in 2025, with the order to be completed by 2028. The airline did not say how much it would charge for seats in its four classes: first, business, premium economy and economy. Each plane will be able to carry 238 passengers with 40% of the cabin dedicated to premium seating. Seats will be roomier than usual, Qantas says. Travellers will also be able to access a \"wellbeing zone\" in the centre of the plane - with a self-service snack bar and space for stretching and movement - to combat the effects of spending 20 hours in the air. Paul Charles, a former Virgin Atlantic communications director, told BBC News the success of the route relied on a cheaper price to attract travellers - who would otherwise break their journey with a stop in the Middle East. Mr Charles, who now runs a travel consultancy, said: \"It's fine if you're in business class and at the front of the plane with more space, but if you're flying economy most people will want to break their journey and it would be a very tough 20-hour flight. He predicted a price war over fares between Europe and Australia - as Middle East airlines operating out of hubs like Dubai and Doha face down the threat from Qantas and its direct service. Qantas could also have a challenge on its hands to make the flight comfortable and entertaining for passengers, Mr Charles added, as well as ensuring their wellbeing. Asked whether other airlines could follow Qantas' lead in launching ultra-long haul flights, he said: \"The question is in 2025 when this is due to launch, what will the world look like?\" \"Will we want to fly such long-haul routes or will consumers want to fly short-haul on more environmentally friendly flights that are shorter in duration?\" The experience of ultra-long haul flying can be \"brutal on the body\", according to travel YouTuber Noel Philips. Mr Philips has flown 18 hours on a non-stop Qatar Airways flight from Auckland to Doha, and 16 hours on a non-stop Qantas flight from London to Perth. \"The problem is you're sort of stuck in one position for such a long period of time,\" he said. \"Especially with some of the older aircraft, there's the issue of dehydration on the body as well, which can take it out of you. \"But the airlines are recognising these flights can be brutal on the body and doing things to make it a bit easier. \"You were getting smoothies to help with your hydration... and the entertainment Qantas had on their Perth route was really good.\" He said he reckoned there would be \"incredible demand\" for the service due to the family and business ties between the UK and Australia. \"If people can do a non-stop flight, I think people will prefer to do a non-stop flight to Australia,\" he added. \"With a stopover somewhere it's just prolonging the whole experience and it turns into a bit of a faff.\" Currently Qantas operates non-stop flights between UK and Australia, with Boeing 787s linking London's Heathrow Airport and the Northern Territory city of Darwin. The flight from Australia takes about 17 hours, and the return journey is about 16 hours long. ",

From Monday hens are allowed back outside, after the government lifted restrictions imposed last November requiring them to stay indoors. It means free-range labelling can return to shelves. Since March, the eggs have been classified as \"barn eggs\" in supermarkets due to the length of time birds had been kept inside. Free-range eggs no longer available in UK\nEgg shortage warning as chicken feed price doubles\nBirds culled amid multiple outbreaks of avian flu Free-range eggs come from hens that have unlimited outdoors access during the daytime. The RSPCA says about 55% of all eggs produced in the UK are free-range. The UK has been facing its largest ever outbreak of avian influenza. While poultry and other captive birds will no longer need to be housed, unless they are in a protection zone, the Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs said other precautions to protect flocks remain in force. They include enhanced cleansing and biosecurity measures. In a joint statement, the four chief veterinary officers said: \"Whilst the lifting of the mandatory housing measures will be welcome news to bird keepers, scrupulous biosecurity remains the most critical form of defence to help keep your birds safe. \"It is thanks to the hard work of all bird keepers and vets, who have played their part in keeping flocks safe this winter, that we are in a position to take this action. \"However, the recent cases of avian influenza show that it's more important than ever for bird keepers to remain vigilant for signs of disease and maintain stringent standards of biosecurity.\" Farmers welcomed the move but warned that there are still challenges. \"It's really nice to see the hens outside,\" said Llyr Jones, a poultry farmer. \"Once they've laid their eggs in the morning, the doors open at 9 o'clock and they can have the rest of the day roaming the fields.\" Mr Jones, who runs the Derwydd farm in Ruthin in north Wales, said the main challenge for farmers now is rising production costs, after the Ukraine war sent prices soaring. Russia and Ukraine are among the world's biggest producers in agriculture and food. Wheat, a core ingredient in chicken feed, has surged in price in recent months. Ukraine war 'catastrophic for global food'\nFarmers warn Ukraine war will hit UK food prices\nFive ways the Ukraine war could push up prices Mr Jones said that since the start of the war, it's costing him an extra £400 a day to feed his hens. Rising energy and labour costs have added to the strain. \"Unfortunately we can't absorb the costs,\" he said. His concerns are echoed by the British Free Range Egg Producers Association. Its chief executive, Robert Gooch, said it was \"really good news\" that shoppers can once again purchase free-range eggs. \"But while it's a relief to my members, lifting the housing order does not solve the crisis facing the egg sector,\" he said. \"It will not remove the huge hikes in energy, transport, feed and labour costs they are experiencing. The picture is bleak.\" Some farmers are calling for retailers to hike egg prices, to help them meet rising costs. But retailers say the market is already tough. Andrew Opie, director of food and sustainability at the British Retail Consortium, said: \"Supermarkets source most of their food from the UK and know they need to pay a sustainable price to farmers but are constrained by how much additional cost they can pass onto consumers in this very difficult market.\" More than 100 cases of bird flu have been confirmed across the country since late October. The virus is highly contagious and can destroy poultry flocks. The housing measures were announced by Defra last November in an attempt to minimise the chances of poultry and other captive birds coming into contact with infected wild birds. The risk to human health is extremely low, according to the NHS. ",

            "content": "Food prices will keep rising, and stay higher \"for quite some time\" due to the high cost of raw materials, Asda chairman Lord Rose has said. Many families struggling with the cost of living crisis are \"going to suffer\", the Conservative peer warned - although retailers will try to keep costs down. The Bank of England expects price inflation to hit 8% this spring. But Business Secretary Kwasi Kwarteng said inflation would not necessarily be long term. Families in the UK have been struggling as energy, fuel and food costs rise rapidly. Speaking to the BBC Sunday Morning programme, the Asda chairman said he feared that food prices \"are going to go higher, and they are going to stay high for quite some time\". Pressures on prices include the war in Ukraine and a resurgence of Covid in China, said Lord Rose. Oil and gas prices were already rising rapidly before Russia's invasion of Ukraine, but the war has pushed prices up further. In turn, this is ramping up raw materials costs for manufacturers and retailers - including for meats like chicken and staples such as pasta - with the price hikes being passed on to consumers. What is the UK's inflation rate and why is the cost of living going up? \"Chicken feed is going up, and all the other associated costs are going up,\" he said. \"I see no quick solution to this. \"Pasta is made from durum wheat, and durum wheat has gone up in price, so that's an inevitable cost increase.\" Co-op chief executive Steve Murrells told the Sunday Times that chicken could become as expensive as beef due to the war in Ukraine. Fast food chain Nando's, which specialises in chicken, said that some of its prices had gone up in April. Lord Rose said retailers \"will do what we can\" to shield customers from raw materials cost increases, but added they were \"not immune from cost increases ourselves\" and would pass them on. He said supermarkets have staff, electricity, fuel, insurance and transport costs, alongside raw materials costs. \"If you're baking biscuits or baking cakes, [energy] goes into the cost of the raw material that you have to pass on [to consumers],\" he said. \"What we have to try and do is mitigate that.\" There is a danger of long-term effects on the economy from high inflation including \"a wage spiral\" and \"stagflation\" - where prices and wages go up, but the economy doesn't grow. \"They are both evil, and the government has got a very difficult and tricky road to navigate,\" Lord Rose said. He added that 90% of Asda customers were \"very worried about the cost of living, and how they are going to make ends meet\". Business Secretary Mr Kwarteng said there was \"obviously an issue with cost of living increases\", but \"we don't know how long that will last\". \"Who can say how long any inflation will last?\" he said. \"It's a global issue, there's no doubt that every economy in the world is looking at the high prices and greater inflation.\" He the government was \"dealing with it by creating jobs.\" High inflation will not necessarily go on for years, Mr Kwarteng added, due to the government's \"energy security strategy\", which includes new nuclear and offshore wind power generation. Energy prices: What is a windfall tax and how would it work? Labour has repeated calls for a windfall tax on oil and gas companies to subsidise energy bills. Mr Kwarteng said he was against a windfall tax because it would discourage investment, but he said Chancellor Rishi Sunak had not ruled it out. Mr Sunak is \"going to look at all options\", Mr Kwarteng added. Talking about Labour's windfall tax proposals, its leader Sir Keir Starmer told Sky News: \"We are not talking about taxing the profits they expected to make. This is the profits they didn't expect to make. \"We would then use that to reduce energy bills by up to £600.\" Labour's shadow foreign secretary David Lammy told the BBC that families dealing with cost of living pressures should not have to face a rise in National Insurance. The government has said this rise will help the NHS recover from Covid and fund social care in England. \"It's absolutely the wrong time for people to face a National Insurance rise,\" he said. \"Let's be clear, we've had 15 tax rises over the last decade from this Conservative government, at a time when four in 10 people are buying less groceries.\" National Insurance: What will tax changes cost me? Liberal Democrat leader Sir Ed Davey said inflation would be high for \"at least a year or two\". \"Millions of pensioners and families are really worried about the cost of living,\" he said. \"They're pretty annoyed that the Conservative government seem to be making it worse with tax rises.\" Scotland's First Minister Nicola Sturgeon said: \"This week, as most people received their pay packet, they finally see the reality of the Tory-made cost of living crisis - a hike in National Insurance, soaring bills and no support from Westminster.\" ",

            "header": "Ghana's e-levy adds 1.5% tax to electronic payments",
            "content": "In a big shop at the heart of the sprawling Makola market in Ghana's capital, Accra, Nana Adwoa Enninful arranges rows of wigs. The 59-year-old sells hair products and accessories from her shop. Some of her business is carried out using mobile money, which is an electronic wallet service that allows registered users to store, send and receive payment using their accounts. This payment method is faster, more convenient, and more reliable than the traditional banking system, according to Ms Enninful. As a consequence, the government's new 1.5% tax on all electronic transactions above 100 Ghanaian cedi ($13; £11) - known as the e-levy - is a source of concern for her. It comes into force on 1 May. \"We have to add e-levy on top of the cost of the item, which will increase the price,\" she tells the BBC. \"Otherwise, we will go back to cash which sometimes doesn't help us because we get fake notes and sometimes underpayments.\" Despite her measured reaction, telling me it is good the government is trying to raise money, she is still worried about the controversial tax, like many market sellers. Ms Enninful is one of many market sellers worried about the controversial tax. The e-levy will also apply to bank transfers and remittances as well as mobile money transactions. Critics of the law say it will hit low-income workers and small businesses the hardest, as they rely heavily on mobile money transactions. Last year, the parliamentary debate on the e-levy ended with punches being thrown, such was the level of disagreement. The law was eventually passed but only after opposition MPs staged a walkout. Banks are far and few between in rural areas of the country and mobile payments are seen as a low-cost, safe and efficient alternative to either a bank account or holding large amounts of cash. As a result nearly 40% of Ghanaians aged 15 and above use mobile money platforms. But the e-levy has raised concerns over the future of mobile money. There are already signs that people are turning their backs on electronic payments. The central bank has reported that the industry lost over $1bn in the two months from last November as consumers started using cash ahead of the tax coming into force. The government has been trying to build a digital economy in recent years to reduce the use of physical cash. But it now admits the new tax could see a big drop in the use of mobile money services within the first few months of it taking effect. Deputy Finance Minister John Kumah told local media that \"there will be about 24% attrition rate in the three months to six months that we will introduce it\". \"The same research told us what should be done to bring back these people after a while, and we have all these things in place,\" he said. Much of Ghana's economy operates outside the formal sector and less than 10% of the population pay direct taxes. The authorities have defended the new tax by saying that it will widen the tax base, boost government revenue and put a dent in the country's $50bn debt. In a recent interview with the BBC, Ghana's President Nana Akufo Addo said that the country's tax-to-GDP ratio was 13% - far lower than the average in West Africa of 18%. Most European countries have a ratio of 35-45%, while the US has about 25%. \"We are talking about taxing an industry where a lot of value is being created and we want to also bring that value into government coffers,\" he added. The government says it will use the money generated by the e-levy for development projects such as building roads and hospitals, and creating jobs to reduce unemployment, although some fear that the extra money raised could instead end up in the pockets of officials. It is estimated that last year $126bn-worth of mobile money transactions were made and the government hopes that the e-levy will raise almost $1bn this financial year. Some experts have suggested alternative ways to generate revenue. Reworking existing taxes instead, like \"corporate income tax, personal income tax, even VAT\" could help the government raise even more money, professor Godfred Bokpin, a lecturer at the University of Ghana Business School, told the BBC. Similar taxes introduced in Zimbabwe and Cameroon have also proved controversial. In 2019, Zimbabwe introduced a 2% money transfer tax that was hugely unpopular. Finance Minister Mthuli Ncube agreed to review it but said it was too early to make adjustments as it was a major source of state revenue. In Cameroon, a proposed 0.2% tax on mobile money transactions triggered a huge backlash and resulted in a social media campaign #EndMobileMoneyTax. The government still went ahead and implemented it in January this year. Tanzania's government is also now considering taxing online businesses. A team of experts from Meta - the company that owns Facebook, Instagram and WhatsApp - visited the commercial hub of Dar es Salaam to hold talks with authorities on how to tax their services in the country. It is likely that other African governments, reeling from the economic hardships of the Covid-19 pandemic and now facing the fallout from the Russia-Ukraine crisis, could turn to an e-levy to raise more money, despite the impact on some citizens. In Ghana, the thousands of people directly employed in the mobile money business are even more alarmed than the traders. \"I'm very worried about the e-levy. The government did not educate us the citizens well about it,\" said James Mawuli, who works as a mobile money vendor in Accra. The 32-year-old helps people manage their mobile money accounts and withdraw cash as needed. He said he had already lost many customers because of the planned e-levy and fears he might lose his job. \"A lot of people have even started withdrawing all their money ahead of its implementation and our transactions have reduced,\" he said. \"It's going to be a big problem for us.\" Opposition MPs are already challenging the legality of the law and have filed an injunction at the Supreme Court. That ruling is expected in early May just days after the tax comes into effect. ",

            "content": "One of Northern Ireland's biggest takeover deals has been called off. Last year the owners of County Tyrone-based Euro Auctions agreed a deal to sell it to Canadian company Ritchie Bros for £775m. However the UK competition watchdog, the Competition and Market Authority (CMA), began an investigation. Ritchie Bros said it did not believe there was \"any realistic prospect\" the deal would be approved by the CMA. Ann Fandozzi, the company's chief executive, said: \"We are disappointed by the decision taken by the CMA to refer the proposed acquisition to a Phase 2 review and respectfully disagree with their views. \"While we believe the proposed acquisition would have accelerated our strategy, we remain committed to forging ahead in our transformational journey.\" Euro Auctions said it would \"like to thank all its customers and suppliers and in particular its employees for their continued loyalty and looks forward to a new and exciting future together as an independent company\". \"The focus continues to be on the expansion and growth of the business,\" the firm added. Euro Auctions was set up in Dromore in 1998 by Derek Keys and his brothers. It has grown to have more than 200 staff across 14 countries. The company buys and sells industrial plant, construction equipment and agricultural machinery all over the world and in 2020 conducted 60 auctions, selling close to 90,000 items for more than £484m. The sales were spread across its nine locations in Great Britain, Northern Ireland, Germany, Spain, the United Arab Emirates, Australia and the US. Ritchie Bros also works in buying and selling used heavy equipment across construction, transportation and agriculture. During an initial review the CMA found the companies had a very high market share in the supply of auction services for heavy construction machinery. Euro Auctions is the clear market leader, with Ritchie Bros ranked as the second largest provider. Both firms offered undertakings to address the CMA's competition concerns but it was not convinced and began an in-depth Phase 2 review. In March David Stewart, CMA executive director, said: \"Many businesses across the UK rely on Ritchie Bros and Euro Auctions to buy and sell heavy construction machinery in the UK. \"This merger would combine the two largest auction providers in this sector, risking higher commissions and lower service quality. \"We are not satisfied that the proposed undertakings from Ritchie Bros would fully address these concerns, which is why we are moving on to an in-depth Phase 2 investigation.\" ",

            "header": "Prepay energy customers disconnect over price rises",
            "content": "Record numbers of prepay gas and electricity customers in the UK stopped topping up their meters after energy prices soared, Citizens Advice said. By the end of April, the charity will have seen more than 1,300 cases of people going without pay-as-you-go power - known as self-disconnection. It comes after a 54% rise in the energy price cap added an average £700 to annual household bills. The Treasury said energy bills were capped until the autumn. \"We won't know yet what the size of the rise will be given the volatility of prices we are seeing now and it's right that we wait until we know how big the rise will be before we decide what the solution should be,\" a Treasury spokesman said. Citizen's Advice said its projected figures on the number of self-disconnections for April had increased eight-fold on the 162 cases it saw in the same month last year. The number of callers seeking help because they cannot afford to top up their meters is already higher than the total figure for 2021, the charity told the BBC. Citizens Advice chief executive Claire Moriarty said prepayment customers were being hit hard by the April price increases. \"This can have devastating consequences - parents with no hot water to bathe their children, families sleeping in their coats and people with chronic illnesses who can't keep warm,\" she said. \"The warning lights could not be flashing brighter and the worst is yet to come. The government must bring in more support to help people cope with this mounting crisis.\" Prepayment energy customers feeling the strain\nBill shock for millions as energy price rises hit\nWhy are prices rising so quickly? At the start of April, about 18 million households on standard tariffs saw their energy bills rise by an average of £693 from £1,277 to £1,971 per year. But for the 4.5 million prepayment customers, often on low incomes, the increase was higher - up £708 from £1,309 to £2,017. The energy regulator Ofgem has previously defended the difference, saying there are higher fixed costs associated with running a prepayment meter. Earlier this month, energy bosses warned MPs that millions of people could fall into fuel poverty this winter as a result of price increases. Keith Anderson, chief executive of Scottish Power, told the Business, Energy, and Industrial Strategy committee (BEIS) that it was \"perverse\" that prepayment customers paid more than others, whilst E.ON UK's boss Michael Lewis said that April's bill increases would have \"a severe impact on customers ability to pay\". Chancellor Rishi Sunak announced a repayable £200 discount on bills for homes in England, Wales and Scotland from October, and a further £150 council tax rebate for most households in England. But Labour criticised the plan, calling it a \"buy now, pay later scheme\". Energy firm Utilita has over 800,000 customers, most of them on prepayment smart meters. At the company's headquarters in Eastleigh, Hampshire, the customer call centre has had a busy month, with a 60% increase in call volumes compared to last April, and 40% more applications for interest free loans. Sasha Dixon leads the extra care team dealing with the most vulnerable customers, and says it's been a very difficult few weeks. \"I've been with Utilita for seven years, and on this team since it started and this is the worst I've ever seen it,\" she said.\"We've had so many distressing cases. So many desperate customers ringing us needing support. \"We had one customer who phoned us last week who had actually sold all their belongings, just to be able to get money to eat. They had nothing left to sell and were waiting on a benefit payment,\" she added. Utilita's founder and chief executive, Bill Bullen, said April had been a \"genuine shock\" for household budgets and that the price rises have had an immediate impact. Like Citizens Advice, the company has seen a rising number of customers not topping up their meters because they're running out of money. He said they were doing everything they could but there was a limit. \"The reality of an energy business today is that it's not a profitable business. There's no spare cash to be spending with customers, and that's the really frustrating thing,\" he said. \"Even in a really good year, you might dream of making a 2% or 3% margin, but that's only around £20 or £30 per customer and what we're seeing here is an increase in bills of around £1,500 a year. \"There's no way that supply companies can even begin to address this problem by themselves. It's way out of our league,\" he added. Mr Bullen said it was great the government was providing energy bill and council tax rebates, but it was nowhere near focussed enough. \"If they had spent £9bn on the 10 million lowest income households, I think they would have made a bigger dent in the problem,\" he said. \"Instead of having £200 for every household, you could have had £600 for the lowest third of households.\" He said everyone in the industry was 100% focussed on how they were going to get customers through the next winter. \"I think the shock in October is going to be huge. We are definitely going to see things like unnecessary increased deaths during the winter period, and just genuine hardship. People don't have that extra £1,500,\" he said. But with high demand for gas around the world continuing as countries move away from Russian supplies, he's not optimistic that prices will come down significantly any time soon. \"Everybody's hoping this is going to be relatively short lived, but the supply and demand balance to me suggests this is something that's going to go on for years, rather than months,\" he said.

            "content": "Tesla chief executive Elon Musk has sold roughly $8.5bn (£6.8bn) worth of shares in the electric car maker, just days after he agreed to buy Twitter. The sale has led to speculation that it will help to finance his planned $44bn buyout of the social media platform. Twitter's board agreed on Monday to accept a takeover offer from Mr Musk. Shares in Tesla fell sharply earlier this week, amid speculation that Mr Musk would sell part of his stake in the carmaker to fund the deal. He tweeted on Thursday evening that he had no plans to sell any more of his shares in the electric carmaker. Filings to the US Securities and Exchange Commission showed that Mr Musk sold a total of 9.6 million Tesla shares this week. The multi-billionaire still owns more than 15% of the company. The BBC is not responsible for the content of external sites.\nView original tweet on Twitter The move marked his first sale of Tesla shares since he offloaded $16.4bn worth of stock in November and December last year. That came after he asked his nearly 89 million Twitter followers whether he should sell 10% of his stake in the electric car maker. Tesla's shares have fallen by around 20% since Mr Musk revealed earlier this month that he had bought a 9.2% stake in Twitter. Twitter adds users as it gears up for Musk takeover\nTesla shares slide could put Twitter deal at risk\nWho is Elon Musk? On Tuesday alone, more than $125bn was wiped off the car maker's stock market value after the social media firm's board accepted his takeover offer. Mr Musk said he would commit $21bn of his assets to help finance the $44bn deal. Investors expected he would sell Tesla shares to help fund the takeover. Mr Musk is the world's richest person, with an estimated net worth of almost $250bn, mostly due to his Tesla stake. He also has a more than 40% stake in the rocket company SpaceX, which is estimated to be worth $100bn. ",

            "content": "Scotland's finance sector says it needs 50,000 recruits in the next three years, so it is casting its net wide - to get beyond stereotypes and draw in people with unconventional skills\nAmong its targets for jobs are people with autism and other 'neuro-divergent' conditions, for whom modern bank offices are being designed.\nAdvice to employers is to talk about the condition, and don't judge on performance until different needs are addressed, including distractions from noise and light, and the way meetings are handled. \"I perceive the world differently, and interact with it differently,\" says Sakura Brandi. \"But that's not necessarily always a bad thing,\" she understates. The 23-year old defines herself as having autism and ADHD. But of course, that's not the only way to define her. She has many other identities: part-Japanese, part-Italian, schooled in Rome, a polyglot with two masters degrees in psychology, and now a graduate and resident of Edinburgh. Working with autistic people before she joined NatWest as a graduate trainee, she only recently realised she shares their condition, and she's still getting used to what that means. \"It gives me lots of creativity and helps me problem-solve in an out-of-the-box way,\" she says. \"There's definitely lots of pluses as well.\" Those who campaign on autism and conditions that come under the banner of \"neuro-divergent\", also including dyslexia and dyspraxia, say they include at least one in 10 of us. The charity Autism Understanding Scotland says it could be between 15% and 25%. That proportion depends where you place the border between neuro-diversity, which includes all of us, and the neuro-divergent, which is those who depart some distance from the norm. That means a large part of the workforce. And not only is that a challenge to managers who already employ such people (and may have such conditions themselves) but an opportunity for recruiters. With a workforce of nearly 60,000, NatWest, which includes Royal Bank of Scotland, has more than 500 people in its neuro-divergent staff group, helping managers to understand their needs with tip sheets, and providing support for each other. Barclays' new office in central Glasgow was designed with advice on the needs of neuro-divergent workers. Among the requirements are to cut down on bright lights, background noise and distractions, which can all become exaggerated. The need to shift attitudes on the issue is particularly true in a tight labour market, but more so when you consider the potential of such people, if they're well managed. Scottish Financial Enterprise, the trade body, reckons that there will be more than 50,000 vacancies in the sector in the next three years. This week, it published a new skills strategy, which aims to help with widening access and career progression. With a change of logo, it has dropped the maths symbols and wishes to challenge stereotypes. Sandy Begbie, chief executive of SFE and the guiding force behind the Scottish government's youth work guarantee, says young people in particular are likely to see finance as a job for the middle class, better-educated, white and usually male. Recruiters have worked hard to overcome that, he says, but there is still work to do. And there are many different work roles to cover, including software, marketing and communications. It's not just about maths, or even about finance. Zsosia Anna Utry is an employer adviser with Aberdeen-based Autism Understanding Scotland, and says autistic people can be afraid to disclose their identity with autism because it is so misunderstood, and those with it are often seen as problematic personalities rather than people in need of different types of support. She advises an open conversation \"without being judged as incapable of doing the job\". She recommends open conversations between line managers without being judged as incapable of doing the job. A specialist assessment can identify the needs of the individual, which can differ widely. \"Usually, it can help if the environment is assessed, so that autistic employees feel comfortable and not overloaded with sensory stimulus, as well as clear information about tasks and duties. And confirming those in writing can be quite helpful.\" It can make a big difference for those with autism to have a fidget toy to help them focus, or a weighted blanket on their knees to help keep them grounded. While lockdown and working from home has made many people more anxious, the move to virtual meetings has helped for some. Zoom and Teams meetings \"have to be more ordered with people taking their turns,\" says Ms Utry. \"It is an equaliser, and if they're not comfortable, they can turn the camera off. If they're not comfortable speaking, they can put their thoughts in the (typed) chat.\" For recruitment, Utry says \"Interviews and panel discussions are difficult, so it's important for recruiters to keep in mind that the assessment reflects the actual job people are required to do. \"The most important thing: assess for the core skills and not for the cultural fit. \"It's important employers understand this is not about difficult personalities, or lack of motivation, when someone has a performance issue. It may be underlying cognitive differences that bring about misunderstanding.\" Sukara, who says she fidgets with plastic beads, admits there are things she struggles with. \"Human interaction can be really exhausting, because a lot of the social norms that we all use are based on what neuro-typical people find the most comfortable and that can be more tiring for me. \"I sometimes struggle with just listening to people for a long time and my brain will switch off or starts to do other things. So I use things like my fidget toy to try and keep my brain engaged for as long as possible. \"Something visual during the meeting is really helpful because then I'm getting that information from two different sources. If they have notes beforehand, that they can help.\" Sukara is very positive about her future at the bank. \"It gives me a lot of variety which is something I really need. I have a lot of interests and I have a lot of things I love doing. \"So I'm quite comfortable where I am now, knowing that I have a lot of space to grow.\" ",

            "header": "OMV: European energy firm mulls Russia rouble demand",
            "content": "One of Europe's biggest Russian gas importers says it must decide by May whether to bend to Moscow's pay demands without undermining Western sanctions. Austria's OMV said it had received a request from Russia's Gazprombank about paying for gas in roubles. Russia has demanded nations pay for oil and gas in roubles and some firms are considering doing so amid supply cuts. But there is concern the system, where firms pay in euros which are converted into roubles, breaks sanctions. OMV's chief executive Alfred Stern, said on Friday that the firm is still paying for natural gas in euros, but its next invoice was due in May. \"We are analysing this and coming up with solutions that are sanctions-compliant,\" he said. It comes after Uniper, one of Germany's biggest energy firms, said on Thursday that it would use the controversial payment mechanism after gas supplies to Poland and Bulgaria were cut off. German energy firm ready to meet Russian pay demand\nRussia gas supply cuts 'blackmail', says EU In late March, Russia said \"unfriendly countries\" would have to start paying for its oil and gas in roubles after Western allies froze billions of dollars the country held in foreign currencies overseas following its assault on Ukraine. Under the decree, non-Russian buyers of gas must pay euros or dollars into an account at Gazprombank, the Swiss-based trading arm of Gazprom, and then convert this into roubles in a second account in Russia. The move is being seen as an attempt to divide Western allies in their response over the war, which has highlighted which European countries are heavily dependent on Russia for energy supplies. EU Commission president Ursula von der Leyen has warned that complying with Russian demands would breach EU sanctions and would be \"high risk\" for companies that did so. But a spokesman for Uniper told the BBC: \"For our company and for Germany as a whole, it is not possible to do without Russian gas in the short term; this would have dramatic consequences for our economy.\" Mr Stern insisted that OMV \"will be compliant with all sanctions and regulatory requirements\". OMV also confirmed that it does still hold some local accounts in Russia for \"office activities\" like paying rents in roubles, which its chief executive said were nothing to do with gas payments. Mr Stern condemned the \"unprovoked attack on Ukraine\", which he said has \"created immeasurable human suffering\". President Vladimir Putin wants energy firms from \"unfriendly countries\" to pay for their gas in roubles - but why? There are several reasons. For a start, it increases demand for roubles, supporting the currency and helping to keep inflation under control. That should, in theory, reduce the hardship faced by Russian consumers and create space for the central bank to cut interest rates. But the way in which the transactions are meant to be carried out also helps Gazprombank avoid becoming a target for EU sanctions - because it is used as a middleman. Then there's the fact Russia doesn't want to become overloaded with euros or dollars because the ways in which it can now use them are strictly limited. But perhaps the biggest benefit for President Putin is that his actions have already sown discord - creating confusion and disunity within the EU over whether or not his demands can or should be met. OMV group reported better-than-expected results for the first three months of 2022. Mr Stern said that gas prices had been pushed higher by increased demand from industry and concerns around supplies due to the conflict. Higher prices off-set a big hit OMV took from its loan for the Nord Stream 2 gas pipeline, which was designed to increase gas flows from Russia directly to Germany, but has now been put on hold because of the war in Ukraine. Sales in the first quarter jumped by 146% to €15.8bn, although its net loss widened to €1bn. The group has also stopped all future investments in Russia. Looking ahead, Mr Stern added that forecasting the company's performance was \"very difficult\". According to the Financial Times, Italy's Eni is also considering opening a Swiss account with Gazprom in order to maintain gas supplies. In an update to investors on Friday, its chief financial officer Francesco Gattei said: \"We will pay the gas in strict compliance with contract terms and following international sanctions. We will respect all these rules.\" The company has until the end of May, when its next payment for Russian supplies is due, to make a final decision. Mr Gattei said that the currency of its gas contract was in euros, the invoices it has received to date have all been in euros, and it hasn't opened a rouble account yet. ",

            "header": "Airbnb to let staff work from home indefinitely",
            "content": "Airbnb is to let its employees work from anywhere for as long as they like, the accommodation platform has said. Its staff will be able to work from home or the office and move anywhere in the country they live without their pay being affected, the company said. The move is in contrast to the likes of Google in the US, where staff who work from home may see their pay cut. Other tech firms who have flexible working policies include Cisco and Microsoft. Airbnb chief executive Brian Chesky sent employees an email on Thursday detailing its new flexible working policy. He predicted that in 10 years, flexible working would be the norm for many people. \"If we limited our talent pool to a commuting radius around our offices, we would be at a significant disadvantage,\" he said. \"The best people live everywhere, not concentrated in one area.\" He added that employees would have \"the flexibility to travel and work around the world\" from September for up to 90 days. Hybrid working is here to stay, say managers Despite this, Mr Chesky still wants employees to meet up regularly for meetings and social events, structured around two major product releases per year. \"Airbnb is in the business of human connection above all else, and we believe that the most meaningful connections happen in person,\" he said. \"Zoom is great for maintaining relationships, but it's not the best way to deepen them. Additionally, some creative work and collaboration is best done when you're in the same room.\" Airbnb had a flexible working arrangement with employees throughout the pandemic, but Mr Chesky's announcement is a \"long term commitment\", a spokeswoman said. Networking technology firm Cisco said in July 2021 that it would allow tens of thousands of its employees to permanently work remotely. Microsoft lets its staff work from home for up to half the time. In August last year, Google said that US employees who opted to work from home may get a pay cut. The search and advertising giant developed a pay calculator that let employees see the effects of working remotely or moving offices. Some remote employees, especially those with a long commute, found they could have their pay cut without changing address. The coronavirus pandemic caused a huge shift in working patterns after countries were forced into lockdown. Many peoplein the UK continued to do their jobs from home, but after guidance was relaxed in July 2021, the government again advised remote working to try to curb the spread of Omicron in December 2021. That guidance changed in January but, according to data from Remit Consulting, the UK's average office occupancy rates has been running at about 20-25% in recent weeks. The Covid pandemic saw a \"significant shift to more home and hybrid working\" according to Ben Willmott, head of public policy for the Chartered Institute of Personnel and Development. From an employer perspective, hybrid working lets firms widen the net when recruiting to try to tackle skills shortages, and it can improve productivity and job satisfaction, he said. For employees, it lets people who have caring responsibilities or a disability have more job options, and can improve work/life balance, he added. However, there are also potential downsides to hybrid working, Mr Willmott said, including the possibility of \"a two-tier workforce of those who have lots of flexibility and those who can't work from home\". Firms may need to offer other forms of flexible working for employees, such as flexitime, to stop this happening, he said. Working from home may also not suit some employees, who may have problems with finding space or with isolation, Mr Wilmott added. The UK government said in September 2021 that would like to give workers the right to request flexible working when they start new jobs from day one, and is reviewing more than 1,600 responses to a consultation that closed in December 2021. However, this week Brexit opportunities minister Jacob Rees-Mogg was criticised for leaving notes for civil servants, saying: \"Sorry you were out when I visited.\" The note, printed on government paper with Mr Rees-Mogg's title, was left at empty desks and read: \"I look forward to seeing you in the office very soon.\" FDA union boss Dave Penman said the note was crass and insulting, and undermined civil service leadership.

            "content": "UK house prices have risen by 12.1% in the past year but the rate of increase is set to slow, according to the Nationwide Building Society. The mortgage lender said that the increase in April was lower than in March, and the trend was likely to continue as budgets were squeezed. The likelihood of further interest rate rises could also affect the market. First-time buyers will still be concerned that annual price rises have been in double digits for months. In all but one month in the past year, annual house price rises have been higher than 10%, the Nationwide said. Across the UK, it said the average house price in April was £267,620. First-time buyers rise: 'I couldn't keep paying rent'\nSecond homes and living costs force out young buyers The UK housing market is continuing to see demand for properties outstripping the number of homes on the market. Employment levels have also been relatively steady, despite the pandemic, which has helped to keep demand high, said Robert Gardner, Nationwide's chief economist. A survey for the building society suggested that 38% of those asked said they were either in the process of moving or considering a move. This demand has pushed up house prices, despite householders also facing higher food and fuel bills. Samantha Bickford, mortgage specialist at Plymouth-based Clarity Wealth Management, said: \"I have not yet personally seen buyers or sellers becoming more nervous given the cost of living crisis. First-time buyers are still keen to get on the property ladder.\" However, Mr Gardner said that the cost of living squeeze would eventually have an impact. \"We continue to expect the housing market to slow in the quarters ahead. The squeeze on household incomes is set to intensify,\" he said. \"Moreover, assuming that labour market conditions remain strong, the Bank of England is likely to raise interest rates further, which will also exert a drag on the market if this feeds through to mortgage rates.\" Are you a first time buyer struggling to get on the housing ladder?

            "header": "Number of firms in critical financial distress rises sharply",
            "content": "A growing number of UK businesses are at risk of going under, as costs spiral and Covid loan repayments come due, a report has found. Construction and hospitality are the sectors struggling most, according to insolvency firm Begbies Traynor. Loan repayment schedules should be extended to ease the pressure, it said. The government said it had given businesses an \"unprecedented package of support\" and increased flexibility in paying back Covid loans. In the first three months of this year there was a 19% rise in businesses in critical financial distress compared to the start of 2021, the report by Begbies Traynor said. Julie Palmer, a partner at the insolvency and restructuring specialist firm, said without further action to help struggling businesses there would be a wave of business failures. \"It's just a case of when the dam holding it back finally bursts,\" she said. Businesses face perfect storm as tax rise kicks in\nRetail sales fall as rising cost of living bites Begbies Traynor, which publishes regular health checks on the state of British businesses, said its \"Red Flag Alert\" research reflected the strain two years of extraordinary financial pressures have had on thousands of companies. It said 1,891 firms now fell into the category of critical, suggesting their outlook is precarious. Although Covid restrictions have been lifted, some firms are still feeling the impact of disruptions to supply chains and the price of energy and other inputs have risen sharply. Firms are finding it hard to recruit staff in some sectors, and wage costs, including the minimum wage and National Insurance payments, have gone up. With the cost of living rising, many UK households are looking for ways to save money, putting further pressure on businesses that rely on discretionary spending, like bars and restaurants. \"Inflation... gets referred to as the silent thief of the economy, I think it's actually becoming a bit of an armed robber, with real inflation probably running much higher than the [official figure] of 7%,\" Ms Palmer said. There is also a \"post-Brexit hangover\" and these factors combined are \"a perfect storm\" of pressures on businesses, she said. Begbies Traynor's research highlights a sharp rise in County Court Judgements (CCJs), an early sign of future insolvencies, because they show creditors are making legal claims. CCJs were up 157% compared to a year ago, the report said. Courts were effectively closed for business for creditors to take action during the pandemic, Ms Palmer said, and the logjam of court cases due to Covid meant the current level of CCJs was likely to be the tip of the iceberg. She added that from Saturday landlords will be able to start making legal claims against businesses. \"We think the landlords, who are a very impatient lobby, will swell those figures,\" she said. Government insolvency figures for March also illustrate the trend towards more insolvencies. They show creditors voluntary liquidations, the most common way for firms to be wound up, had more than doubled compared to a year earlier. During the acute phase of the pandemic many firms relied on state support. But that support was now gone while firms were now facing a perfect storm of rising wage, energy and borrowing costs, Begbies Traynor said. Ms Palmer said the government faced a choice: \"Do they rush to recover funds handed out during the pandemic to ensure there was a functioning economy afterwards? Or [do they] look for ways to control the number of businesses that fail? \"Having put so much money into protecting businesses over the past two years, ministers won't want to see it wasted as companies collapse, unable to repay their debts,\" she said. She said leniency, or taking a longer-term view of repayments of the Coronavirus Business Interruption Loan Scheme, would help embattled businesses. A government spokesperson said support offered to businesses during the pandemic included VAT cuts, business rates holidays and government-backed loans worth around £400bn. \"We have given businesses increased flexibility in repaying their Covid-19 loans, with borrowers under the Bounce Back Loan scheme able to extend their repayment term by ten years, as well as apply for repayment holidays,\" the spokesperson added.

            "content": "Three of the world's biggest Covid vaccine makers have seen off attempts to make them share the know-how to make their jabs. A group of investors put proposals to the annual shareholders meetings of Pfizer, Johnson & Johnson and Moderna but were voted down. They argued sharing this intellectual property would speed up the rollout of vaccines by boosting manufacturing. But the drug-makers say they are making doses faster than they can be used. More than 11.4 billion doses of vaccine have now been distributed worldwide, although a third of the global population have not had a single dose, according the head of the World Health Organization Dr Tedros Ghebreyesus. Covid vaccines: How fast is worldwide progress?\nAstraZeneca to take profits from Covid vaccine Taking the unprecedented step of addressing the Moderna annual general meeting (AGM), he said their help to boost vaccine production \"would save lives, decrease the risk of variants and reduce the pandemic's economic toll\". But his argument that the \"global inequity would lead to many more deaths\" was not enough to convince shareholders. Only 24% backed the idea of the company undertaking a feasibility study into transferring intellectual property and technical know-how to manufacturers in low and middle-income countries. Amongst Pfizer shareholders only 27.3% were in favour a similar motion. Johnson & Johnson has not yet released numbers but the proposal also failed there. Netherlands-based Achmea Investment Management is leading a group of 65 firms who collectively control $3.5tn of assets, and support the idea. \"I think a significant amount of the investors have shown us support of these steps,\" Frank Wagemans, Achmea's senior engagement specialist told the BBC. But he added: \"We need more in the months and years ahead because we know the Covid pandemic is not over yet.\" He said it was a \"small win\" that Moderna had at least introduced a link between executive bonuses and how well the firm meets demand for Covid vaccines from less well-off countries. \"The global economic recovery continues to be constrained by unequal access to tools to prevent and treat Covid-19,\" International Monetary Fund economist Ruchir Agarwal told the BBC. The development body says an improved roll-out can help boost the global economy by $9tn by 2025. Last year Moderna delivered 807 million doses of Covid vaccines, which made it a profit of $12.2bn. It says that more than a quarter of these went to low or middle-income countries. Laying out the case against the shareholder proposal, its board of directors said it could have delivered more if it hadn't been for \"last mile\" difficulties and highlighted Africa as an example. These problems include refrigeration capacity, the availability of health workers and vaccine hesitancy. The US based firm also says its working with its partners to increase production and is building a manufacturing facility in Kenya to increase future availability of vaccines. Albert Bourla, chief executive of Pfizer, which developed its vaccine with BioNTech, told his shareholders that 3.4 billion vaccine doses have now been distributed in 179 countries. Opposing the sharing of its intellectual property, the company's board argued that \"vaccine manufacturing is a biological production that is extraordinarily complex\", involving 280 ingredients from 86 suppliers in 19 countries. They added there was a risk to patients if other manufacturers were not able to meet all the requirements to make its vaccines properly. It is expanding production to four billion does this year, with a quarter going to less well-off countries. Those with the lowest incomes will get the vaccines at cost price, Mr Bourla told shareholders. Drug maker bonuses threatened over vaccine access\nWHO: New Covid-19 variants will emerge unless more are vaccinated\nHundreds of unions issue vaccine supply chain plea Johnson & Johnson has had hundreds of millions of dollars of US taxpayers support to develop its vaccine. It says last year it worked with the African Union and Covax alliance to provide 900 million doses at a not-for-profit price and that it is working on a licencing agreement with an African company that would ensure safety standards are adhered to. The proposals to share intellectual property were submitted by Oxfam USA, which owns shares in each of the pharmaceutical firms, allowing it to push for changes. The arguments of all three against its motions \"don't hold water\", according to Robbie Silverman, from Oxfam USA. \"What the donation-based status quo has achieved is 74% vaccination rates in rich countries and 12% vaccination rates in poor countries,\" he said. Vaccine hesitancy has been exaggerated by the drug makers, he told the BBC, adding that a system controlled by a few giant companies has caused distribution problems. \"It makes it very hard to plan on the ground when you don't know how many doses are coming,\" he said. \"Lower incomes countries are saying give us the tools that we need to manufacture our own doses for our own citizens, and that locally based manufacturing will solve many problems.\" Achmea's Mr Wagemans is optimistic change will still come, saying it takes time to change corporate policies and the votes sent a \"strong message towards management\".

            "header": "Brexit import checks delayed for fourth time",
            "content": "The government has delayed introducing more checks on EU goods entering the UK over fears it will disrupt supply chains and add to rising inflation. New import controls on EU food products had been due to begin in July. The government said \"it would be wrong to impose new administrative burdens and risk disruption at ports\" at a time of higher costs due to the war in Ukraine and rising energy prices. It is the fourth time it has delayed EU import checks since the UK left the EU. Brexit opportunities minister Jacob Rees-Mogg said the government was reviewing how it would implement checks on EU goods and \"the new controls regime will come into force at the end of 2023\". He claimed that the delay would save British businesses up to £1bn in annual costs. Mr Rees-Mogg said it would have been \"an act of self-harm\" if the government had decided to go ahead with the import controls. He said the checks would have brought \"quite significant\" price increases for people at a time when the government was \"trying to reduce costs.\" These would have included a \"71% increase - maximum level - on the retail price\" of small deliveries like cheese. He said: \"You would have been adding potentially £500 of costs on a shipment of fish fingers, that then falls through to the consumer.\" Business groups welcomed the move. \"We are dealing with significant supply chain stress and inflationary costs this year and this would have made a bad situation much worse,\" said Shane Brennan, chief executive of the Cold Chain Federation. The Federation of Small Businesses said: \"Imposition of full import controls this summer would have meant yet another burden for small firms which are already wrestling with new trade rules and spiralling operating costs.\" However, ports, which have spent millions of pounds gearing up for the checks, said they had been \"landed with the bill of the government Brexit border U-turn\". They have been building border control posts that would allow checks on imports of EU food and animals. But those checks have not only been delayed, but may not be needed if a \"light touch\" regime is brought in, potentially meaning that the new infrastructure will be \"useless\", the British Ports Association said. \"This announcement is a major policy change, meaning the facilities will effectively become white elephants, wasting millions of pounds of public and private funding, not to mention the huge effort there has been to get things ready in time,\" the association's chief executive Richard Ballantyne said. He said ports were looking for \"clarification from policy makers if there will be any type of financial assistance or compensation for ports and also if operators can start to bulldozer the facilities and use the sites for other purposes\". The Major Ports Group, which represents major UK ports and freeports, said they had been \"working incredibly hard and have invested over £100m of their own money\" in new border posts which could be \"highly bespoke white elephants\". Meanwhile, the National Farmers' Union (NFU) said the decision was \"another blow to farm businesses that are already struggling with enormous inflationary costs and ongoing labour shortages\". \"Our producers have to meet stringent controls to export their own products abroad, all while being left at a continued competitive disadvantage to our EU competitors, who are still enjoying an extended grace period which gives them access to the prized UK market relatively cost and burden free,\" NFU president Minette Batters said. She added that checks on agricultural food imports were \"absolutely critical to the nation's biosecurity, animal health and food safety\". The British Veterinary Association also criticised the move, saying it \"flies in the face not only of common sense, but also of the government's commitment to preserving high levels of animal and human health in the UK\". James Russell, the association's senior vice president, said it had repeatedly warned that delaying veterinary checks further \"could weaken vital lines of defence\" against diseases. This is more than just yet another delay on the post-Brexit system for imports. It is, says the government, a significant change of policy that could mean wide-ranging laborious physical checks on food imports from the EU might never be introduced. Such checks were originally thought to be the inevitable consequence of the distant harder Brexit deal struck by Boris Johnson. What is certain is that such checks are in the long grass, and that will come as a huge relief to many in the logistics industry and in particular the supermarkets. The government's plan is that a new digital trade border, applying to the whole world, will be in place at least in trial form by the end of 2023. This will mean that only a tiny proportion of the physical checks on food imports due to have rolled out from this July will be needed. For Mr Rees-Mogg, agreeing lower trade barriers than had been planned is good policy. But it is an about-turn to lower barriers to provide an incentive for the EU to reduce its equivalent stringent checks on UK food exports. For now, the supermarkets will be happy to avoid what could have been an acute source of further supply chain and inflationary pressure. But some UK food exporters face the triple whammy of marathon length haulage queues in Kent, dozens of pages of red tape for sales in Europe, and no equivalent restrictions on competition from abroad for the UK market.

            "content": "One of Germany's biggest energy firms has said it is preparing to buy Russian gas using a payment system that critics say will undermine EU sanctions. Uniper says it will pay in euros which will be converted into roubles, meeting a Kremlin demand for all transactions to be made in the Russian currency. Other European energy firms are reportedly preparing to do the same amid concerns about supply cuts. Uniper said it had no choice but said it was still abiding by EU sanctions. \"We consider a payment conversion compliant with sanctions law and the Russian decree to be possible,\" a spokesman told the BBC. \"For our company and for Germany as a whole, it is not possible to do without Russian gas in the short term; this would have dramatic consequences for our economy.\" Germany's biggest energy supplier RWE declined to comment on how it would pay for Russian gas. In late March, Russia said \"unfriendly countries\" would have to start paying for its oil and gas in roubles to prop up its currency after Western allies froze billions of dollars it held in foreign currencies overseas. Under the decree, European importers must pay euros or dollars into an account at Gazprombank, the Swiss-based trading arm of Gazprom, and then convert this into roubles in a second account in Russia. The European Commission said last week that if buyers of Russian gas could complete payments in euros and get confirmation of this before any conversion into roubles took place, that would not breach sanctions. However there are different views among countries on how to interpret its initial guidance, and this week EC boss Ursula von der Leyen sparked confusion when she said firms could still be breaking the rules. On Thursday, an EU official confirmed that any attempt to convert cash into roubles in Russia would be a \"clear circumvention of sanctions\" as the transaction would involve Russia's central bank. \"What we cannot accept is that companies are obliged to open a second account and that between the first and second account, the amount in euros is in the full hands of the Russian authorities and the Russian Central Bank, and that the payment is only complete when it is converted into roubles.\" How much does Europe rely on Russia for gas?\nRussia gas supply cuts 'blackmail', says EU\nRussia halts gas exports to Poland and Bulgaria On Tuesday, Poland and Bulgaria both refused to pay for gas in roubles leading to Russian state gas firm Gazprom shutting off supplies. Both countries had already planned not to renew their contracts with Gazprom when they expired later in 2022. Poland - one of the staunchest advocates of tougher sanctions on Russia - said the EU should penalise countries that used roubles to pay for Russian gas. Climate minister Anna Moskwa singled out Germany, Hungary and Austria as resisting a gas embargo. \"We are counting on there being consequences for these countries [which pay in roubles] and that as a result they will cease paying in roubles,\" she said. The move by Russia - which has not given countries the same deadline to begin paying in roubles - is seen as an attempt to divide Western allies in their response over Ukraine. The majority - 97% - of EU companies' gas supply contracts with Gazprom stipulate payment in euros or dollars. Hungary and Slovakia have both said they will use Russia's conversion payment method, while German economy minister Robert Habeck said on Wednesday that it was \"the path that the EU marked out for us\". \"It's the path that is compatible with sanctions, and as far as I understand the German companies that are doing it this way are in compliance with their contracts,\" he said. \"Most EU countries are taking this approach.\" Europe gets about 40% of its natural gas from Russia, but it is much higher for some countries and sudden supply cuts could have a huge economic impact. \"A lot of European companies will say OK, we'll pay into a euro-denominated bank account and there will be a back-to-back trade so they stay within the limits of the EU sanctions,\" said Nathan Piper, an energy analyst at Investec. \"But there are two sides of this - those firms need to supply gas to consumers and in Germany there is no alternative to supplies of Russian gas right now.\" According to the Financial Times, Austrian energy giant OMV is also planning to adopt the mechanism while Italy's Eni is considering the move. Eni declined to comment while OMV denied it was opening a Swiss account with Gazprom. It told the BBC: \"We have analysed the Gazprom request about payment methods in light of the EU-sanctions and are now working on a sanctions-compliant solution.\" ",

            "content": "Twitter, which this week agreed to be bought by billionaire Elon Musk, has said its user numbers grew faster than expected over the past year. Advertising revenue has also been rising, but by less than was forecast. Some observers have questioned Mr Musk's commercial judgement in buying Twitter, a platform that despite its high profile has not consistently made high returns. In the latest quarter it made a profit of $513m (£412m) on revenues of $1.2bn. Daily active users of the platform rose to 229 million, up from 199 million a year earlier, the company said, publishing its latest financial results. New users grew faster outside the US, by 18.1%, than in its home market where numbers were up 6.4% over the 12 months to the end of March. How Elon Musk might change Twitter\nAdvertisers nervous of Musk’s Twitter takeover\nElon Musk warned he must protect Twitter users This week Twitter's board agreed a $44bn sale to Tesla boss, Mr Musk, the world's richest person, and a prolific user of the platform. In publishing its results, the firm said it was withdrawing all previously provided guidance over its immediate commercial outlook. However, it did say revenues had been affected by \"headwinds associated with the war in Ukraine\". Mr Musk's purchase is likely to take several months to complete, after which the company will be owned privately. While Mr Musk has not made clear his precise plans for the platform, he has spoken about reducing advertising, and cracking down on \"bot\" or automated accounts. He has also prompted controversy by suggesting there may be a new approach to how Twitter moderates free speech. ",

            "header": "US economy contracts as Ukraine war hits trade",
            "content": "The US economy contracted in the first three months of the year partly due to trade disruption from the Ukraine war. Figures from the Commerce Department showed that gross domestic product fell at an annualised rate of 1.4%. Slower growth had been expected but the figure was worse than forecast, marking the first fall since the coronavirus-induced recession in 2020. Analysts said a surge in imports, as exports fell, made the economy look worse than it was. \"This is noise; not signal,\" said Ian Shepherdson, chief economist at Pantheon Macroeconomics. \"The economy is not falling into recession.\" Though inflation is running at a four decade high, households have not yet pulled back purchases. Consumer spending - the engine of the US economy - remained healthy, rising at an annual rate of 2.7% in the quarter, up from the end of last year. But businesses faced new supply disruptions in the first three months of the year, making trade figures more unpredictable than usual. Figures this week showed the US trade deficit in goods reached a record high last month, as coronavirus cases triggered shutdowns in China and the war in Ukraine upended key industries, including agriculture and oil. Analysts said the unexpectedly large surge in imports, which count against US output in calculations of GDP, was probably due to businesses accelerating purchases. Meanwhile exports fell, hurt in part by lower demand abroad. A decline in government spending also weighed on growth. Until now, recovery from the pandemic has largely been faster than expected, helped by government spending, including pandemic relief cheques to households. In the last three months of 2021, the US economy expanded at an annualised rate of 6.9%. Analysts said they did not see recession as imminent, despite the contraction, but they warned that rising prices mean that households will not be able to keep spending at their current pace. \"Consumers have been able to maintain positive rates of real spending by reducing their savings rates. But if inflation continues to erode purchasing power, then consumers may eventually decide to retrench,\" Wells Fargo economists wrote in a recent note. The US central bank has started increasing interest rates to try to curb inflation, but that brings economic risks as well, as such moves typically slow activity. Wells Fargo said it saw a 30% chance of recession in 2023. \"Although the US economy does not appear to be on the cusp of another downturn, the probability of recession next year is not insignificant, in our view,\" they said. The days of extraordinary growth associated with the reopening of the economy may be over. But the latest figures suggest that underlying growth in the American economy remains strong, at least for now. Towards the end of 2021, companies rushed to build up inventories to avoid any supply chain disruptions. Firms wanted to make sure there were no empty shelves over the holiday period. The knock on effect was that they didn't have to do as much restocking at the start of this year. America's growing trade deficit also subtracted 3.2 percentage points from overall GDP growth. Exports fell sharply and imports soared, a reflection of strong demand in the US and weaker economic growth abroad. Meanwhile, America continues to add jobs, and businesses and consumer spending remain robust. There are plenty of risks to be worried about - inflationary pressures, new Covid variants, the war in Ukraine and lockdowns in China. But the takeaway from this initial GDP report is that the challenges have hurt more abroad than here in the US. ",

            "content": "Energy firms have been asked to delay the closure of UK coal-fired power plants, by the government. The move follows concerns over possible disruption to Russian gas supplies to Europe due to the war in Ukraine. The government said it was exploring \"a wide range of options to further bolster our energy security and domestic supply\". The plants were due to close in the autumn as the UK moves towards more sustainable energy production. Business Secretary Kwasi Kwarteng wrote to EDF, Drax and Uniper this month to ask that they temporarily extend the operation of the coal plants, which are used for back-up generation. The UK gets very little of its power from coal, but generates a lot of electricity from gas. A government spokesperson said: \"In light of Russia's illegal invasion of Ukraine, it is right that we explore a wide range of options to further bolster our energy security and domestic supply. \"That's why we are exploring slightly extending the life of our remaining coal-fired power stations to provide additional back up electricity this coming winter if needed. \"It remains our firm commitment to end the use of coal power by October 2024.\" The government is \"confident that electricity security will be maintained\". The energy suppliers would receive subsidies worth tens of millions of pounds, the Times reported, and those subsidies would be recouped from energy bills. Ukraine war: Russia halts gas exports to Poland and Bulgaria\nUkraine War: Russia gas supply cuts 'blackmail', says EU French energy giant EDF, which has been asked to delay the full closure of its West Burton A plant in Nottinghamshire, said half of the plant started to be decommissioned in the summer of 2021, and the rest was \"available over the recent winter to supply electricity during peak times\". \"The plan is to start decommissioning the final two units at the start of October 2022, and many processes have already been put in place to achieve that, including reducing the site's staffing numbers and running down the coal stock,\" it said. \"EDF has recently been asked by the UK government to consider what it would take to make West Burton A available next winter and this remains under discussion.\" The three energy firms are in discussions with the National Grid Electricity System Operator, which makes sure UK electricity supply meets demand, over the amount of subsidy that would be needed to keep that coal-fired capacity. EDF said it needed the Electricity System Operator \"to offer acceptable terms\" so it could invest in the plant, buy coal, and support operating costs. \"We would be available on a standby arrangement, like this last winter, supplying at peak periods only,\" a spokesperson said. Drax, which mothballed the coal-fired units at its North Yorkshire power station in 2021, said it still expected to close them completely in September 2022, \"but remains committed to supporting security of supply in the UK\". It said whether it would delay closing them \"remains under review\" and that it is \"looking carefully\" at options. Uniper, one of Germany's biggest energy firms, said the government had asked it to explore the possibility of keeping its unit at Ratcliffe power station, due to close in September 2022, open for longer. On Wednesday, Russia halted gas exports to Poland and Bulgaria after they refusal to pay for supplies in roubles. Russian President Vladimir Putin has ordered \"unfriendly\" countries to pay for gas in roubles as part of efforts to prop up the currency in the wake of Western sanctions over its invasion of Ukraine. The EU called the decision to halt Polish and Bulgarian supplies \"an instrument of blackmail\". ",

            "content": "Profits at Sainsbury's have more than doubled but the supermarket has warned it faces tougher times ahead as shoppers see their finances squeezed. It reported an underlying profit of £730m for the year to March, up from £357m a year earlier. But it expects profits to be lower this year with customers \"watching every penny\" amid the rising cost of living. Sainsbury's said it was trying to limit price increases despite facing higher costs from suppliers. \"We can see the early signs of customers being a bit more cautious, watching every penny, every pound,\" said chief executive Simon Roberts. Consumer goods giant Unilever, which owns brands such as PG Tips and Marmite, said on Thursday that its prices have increased rapidly in the past few months. Prices have gone up by 8.3% as costs for raw materials jumped and Unilever warned it was facing even higher costs for the remainder of the year. Tesco vows to rein in prices as profits treble\nWhy are prices rising so quickly? Sainsbury's said that although it had been raising food prices, the increases were at a slower pace to its rivals. \"We are doing everything we can to keep the prices low on products that really matter to our customers,\" Mr Roberts told the BBC. \"We can see there are challenges and pressures coming in many areas and customers and households are really feeling the pressure on their household finances.\" Mr Roberts said Sainsbury's had lowered prices across 150 of its most-purchased fresh products last week. He added the supermarket's own-brand products were also proving more popular with customers, but said it was too early to see if this was a \"long-term trend\". However, households \"still want to buy into the key events\", such as Easter and Mother's Day. Supply chain issues, the Ukraine war and rising raw material costs are all contributing to soaring food prices. Mr Roberts said the situation in Ukraine was pushing up the costs of food production, with the country being a large exporter of fertilisers used in farming. \"We are doing everything we can to pass on [costs] as little as possible [to customers] and we are doing that by working in our business to find cost savings,\" he said. He added shortages in sunflower oil, another product Ukraine exports, meant Sainsbury's was offering alternatives in its stores. Sainsbury's bumper profits come as research suggests the average food bill could increase by £271 this year as prices continue to rise. Grocery prices were 5.9% higher in April than a year ago, the biggest increase since December 2011, according to research company Kantar. Sainsbury's has followed the UK's biggest supermarket Tesco in forecasting lower profits for the current year. It said there were \"significant uncertainties\" weighing on the business ahead, due to higher cost pressures and the squeeze on household incomes. The supermarket reported a rise in annual grocery sales, up by 7.6% from two years ago, partly due to dining out being restricted by Covid restrictions. However, non-food sales were hit hard by difficulties with supply chains, with general merchandise sales falling 4.6% on 2019-20. Unilever said its higher prices meant that some customers, especially those in Europe and Latin America, bought less from the company. But the amount of money Unilever made in sales still increased by 7.3% in the first quarter of the year, it said. Chief executive Alan Jope said: \"We are executing well in a very challenging input cost environment.\" ",

            "content": "Indian billionaire Mukesh Ambani is planning a takeover bid for the UK high street chain Boots. Mr Ambani is the biggest shareholder and chairman of retail-to-energy group Reliance Industries. Mumbai-based Reliance is working on the potential bid with US buyout firm Apollo Global Management. Earlier this year, the Walgreens Boots Alliance announced a review of the Boots business and reportedly put the company up for sale. Asia richest man to bring 7-Eleven shops to India\nAsia's richest man, a bomb scare and a murder The deal would see Boots expand into India, Southeast Asia and the Middle East as well as growing the business in the UK. Under the plan, Reliance and Apollo would own stakes in Boots, although it was not clear whether they would be equal partners in the business. Boots - which has more than 2,200 pharmacies, health and beauty stores in the UK - could be valued at as much as £6bn ($7.5bn), according to the Financial Times, which first reported the story. The Walgreens Boots Alliance declined to comment while Reliance did not immediately respond to a BBC request for comment. Mr Ambani is the eighth richest person in the world. The 65-year-old is also the second richest person in Asia, with an estimated net worth of more than $100bn, according to the Bloomberg Billionaires Index. His late father Dhirubhai Ambani founded a textile manufacturer that would eventually become Reliance Industries. It is now one of India's largest conglomerates - with businesses including petrochemicals, oil and gas, telecoms and retail. Mr Ambani currently owns more than 49% of Reliance Industries. The Ambani family already own assets in the UK worth tens of millions of pounds. In 2019, Reliance Brands Limited, which is owned by Mr Ambani, bought the toy retailer Hamleys for an undisclosed sum. Last year, Reliance Industries bought the historic British country club Stoke Park for £57m. The future of the 173-year-old Boots business has been in question for months. In January, its US-based owner, the Walgreens Boots Alliance said it had started a strategic review of the retailer \"in line with its recently announced priorities and strategic direction that include a greater focus on US healthcare\". \"Further announcements will be made in due course, after the right decision has been reached for Boots' future and for all stakeholders,\" the company said. The owners of UK supermarket group Asda - brothers Mohsin and Zuber Issa and private equity firm TDR Capital - have also reportedly made an initial bid for Boots. Arunoday Mukharji, BBC News, Delhi Mukesh Ambani has been increasing his footprint in the retail space by projecting Reliance Industries as a giant in the sector. Its retail ambitions run across categories from luxury fashion to electronics and groceries. The company operates India's fastest growing and most profitable retail business with over 12,000 stores across India. Mr Ambani has also been raking in investments, looking to expand his e-commerce operations to compete against the likes of Walmart-owned Flipkart and Amazon. In September 2020 alone, Reliance Retail brought in foreign investments worth nearly $3.5bn. Some of the biggest investments came from the likes of Google and Facebook, which helped Mr Ambani integrate his telecoms and online retail businesses. And his ambitions have not been restricted to India as he eyes business around the world, like the iconic toy shop Hamleys - which he bought in 2019. What Reliance has been missing, say analysts, is a piece of the pharmacy and wellness sector - and that is what it plans to achieve through a tie-up with Boots. India has recently seen a rise in online pharmacy retailers and this potential deal would enable Reliance to fast-track its entry into the sector. But as big online retailers like Walmart and Amazon sell everything, retailers offering more specific ranges have struggled to get a foothold in the massive Indian market. It will also be interesting to see how Reliance positions itself in the pharmacy and wellness business abroad. ",

            "content": "Car production in the UK has continued to fall as manufacturers struggle with global supply chain problems. Almost 100,000 fewer cars were built in the first three months of 2022 compared to last year. Manufacturing has dropped by nearly a third, according to the Society of Motor Manufacturers and Traders (SMMT). The SMMT linked the decline to a global shortage of computer chips and rising energy costs for manufacturers. New number plate fails to boost March car sales\nIs Europe's computer chip shortage plan too late? During the first three months of the year, a total of 207,347 new cars were built in the UK, down from 306,558 in the same three months in 2021, when the pandemic created added pressures for manufacturers. Manufacturers have been struggling to get hold of the parts they need - in particular semiconductors, or computer chips, which are widely used on modern vehicles. The closure of Honda's plant in Swindon last year has also been a major factor, and has contributed to a steep reduction in the number of cars exported to the US. Exports to the US saw the greatest decrease last month and declined by 63.8% during March, while exports to the EU declined by 24.5%. The war in Ukraine is also having an effect on production, with factories struggling to get hold of parts such as wiring systems that would normally come from the region. Meanwhile, carmakers are becoming increasingly concerned about the impact of rising energy costs. The UK's car industry had hoped to be well on the road to recovery by now - but it hasn't happened. Last year was a dismal one for the industry - and so far, 2022 has been even worse. Part of the decline in production is down to Honda. Its factory in Swindon shut down last July, removing a significant chunk of the country's output. But the impact of Covid has been huge. The car industry relies on very efficient, very streamlined manufacturing systems - where parts arrive from around the world at the factories where they're needed pretty much exactly when they're needed. But Covid has thrown a huge spanner in the normally smoothly-operating machinery. Supply chains have been disrupted and vital parts - particularly computer chips - have not been there when needed. When that happens production has to be slowed or even stopped. Now there are other problems to contend with as well. The war in Ukraine has pushed energy prices sky high - a major problem for the industry. It has also triggered new parts shortages. This situation isn't unique to the UK. But it comes at a time when the car industry here is desperate to put itself at the forefront of the move to electric vehicles - and attract the new investment which was in very short supply during the years of Brexit-related uncertainty. Some good news is badly needed. Mike Hawes, chief executive of the SMMT said that two years after the start of the pandemic, automotive production was \"still suffering badly\". \"Recovery has not yet begun and, with a backdrop of an increasingly difficult economic environment, including escalating energy costs, urgent action is needed to protect the competitiveness of UK manufacturing,\" Mr Hawes continued. \"We want the UK to be at the forefront of the transition to electrified vehicles, not just as a market but as a manufacturer so action is urgently needed if we are to safeguard jobs and livelihoods,\" he added. Responding to the figures, Chris Knight, automotive partner at consultancy firm KPMG, said component and material availability challenges remain, with the problems caused by the pandemic now \"added to by conflict in Ukraine\". \"A focus on prioritising available components and materials into higher-margin vehicle production and sales has been to the detriment of some parts of the fleet industry,\" Mr Knight added.

            "content": "Elon Musk has lost a bid to get out of an agreement made with regulators requiring oversight of his tweets about his car firm Tesla. The settlement was made after he tweeted he had \"funding secured\" to potentially take Tesla private despite a deal not being close. The ruling comes just days after the world's richest person struck a deal to buy Twitter for $44bn (£35bn). Mr Musk says he wants to make Twitter a bastion of free speech. The Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) accused Mr Musk of misleading investors with the 2018 tweet, which caused Tesla's share price to fluctuate. Mr Musk's lawyers argued that the SEC's pursuit of him \"crossed the line into harassment\" and interfered with his right to free speech. US District Judge Lewis Liman rejected those arguments as well as Mr Musk's request to stop a separate SEC investigation into tweets he posted last year regarding the sale of some of his Tesla stock. Tesla shares slide could put Twitter deal at risk\nElon Musk warned he must protect Twitter users\nHow Elon Musk might change Twitter \"Musk cannot now seek to retract the agreement he knowingly and willingly entered by simply bemoaning that he felt like he had to agree to it at the time but now — once the spectre of the litigation is a distant memory and his company has become, in his estimation, all but invincible — wishes that he had not,\" Mr Liman wrote. The agreement in 2018 required Mr Musk and Tesla to pay $20m each in civil fines and for him to step down as the chairman of the electric car maker. It also required Mr Musk to obtain approval from Tesla's lawyers for tweets and other public statements about the company. The SEC's probe is about tweets Mr Musk posted on 6 November, asking his more than 80m Twitter followers whether he should sell 10% of his stake in Tesla. A majority of those who voted in the poll said he should sell the stake and Mr Musk has since sold more than $16bn worth of Tesla shares. Tesla's share price fell in the wake of the poll and the SEC is investigating whether those tweets were cleared by Tesla lawyers before they were posted. Mr Liman said it was \"unsurprising\" that the regulator would have questions about the way Mr Musk went about making his decision to sell the shares. Tesla did not immediately respond to a request for comment from the BBC. The BBC is not responsible for the content of external sites.\nView original tweet on Twitter Mr Musk, who is a self-described \"free speech absolutist\", has called for a shakeup of Twitter's moderation policies, which he sees as a threat to free speech. Since the board of Twitter agreed to Mr Musk's takeover bid earlier this week, he has posted several tweets about how he wants the social media platform to change under his ownership. On Wednesday he tweeted \"For Twitter to deserve public trust, it must be politically neutral, which effectively means upsetting the far right and the far left equally\". ",

            "content": "Facebook stopped losing users as 2022 got under way, even as its owner reported its slowest revenue growth in a decade. The number of daily active Facebook users grew to 1.96 billion in the first three months of the year, parent company Meta reported on Wednesday. That marked a turnaround from last year, when the social network reported a decline in users for the first time. The drop wiped billions from the firm's market value. Since executives disclosed the fall in February, the firm's share price has nearly halved. But shares jumped 19% in after-hours trade on Wednesday. \"More people use our services today than ever before, and I'm proud of how our products are serving people around the world,\" said Meta boss Mark Zuckerberg, who founded Facebook in 2004. But Meta - which also owns Instagram and WhatsApp - still reported its slowest revenue growth in at least a decade. Facebook owner Meta sees biggest ever market loss\nFacebook sees daily users fall for first time ever Revenues in the first three months of the year were up just 7% compared to 2021, hitting $27.9bn. Analysts say businesses are pulling back on advertising as they grapple with rising costs and economic uncertainty, stemming in part from the war in Ukraine. And while Google and Facebook have long been the go-to sites for online ad dollars, they are facing more competition as newer platforms such as TikTok draw users and online shopping giant Amazon gets into the business. Google-owner Alphabet earlier this week said advertising revenue in the first three months of the year rose 22%, more slowly than analysts had expected, while the smaller Snap also warned of troubles. Mr Zuckerberg said the firm was investing in its video \"Reels\" to compete with TikTok, and expected ad sales to catch up. But Meta is also grappling with new privacy rules from Apple, which make it more difficult to target adverts. The company has said the changes could cost it $10bn in lost sales this year. The company said it expected revenue in the coming months of $28bn to $30bn - below analyst estimates. Meta said this reflected factors including the war in Ukraine and the potential impact of regulatory changes in Europe. In March Russia banned access to Facebook and Instagram, as part of its crackdown on independent media following the invasion of Ukraine. Mr Zuckerberg has said that the firm will invest heavily in artificial intelligence and virtual reality - the so-called Metaverse - for its next phase of growth. But that is costing it dearly for now. Overall, Meta's profits in the quarter were $7.46bn - more than analysts had expected but still down 20% year-on-year. \"Meta's ad business continues to face some very real challenges,\" said Jasmine Enberg, principal analyst at Insider Intelligence. \"Facebook, of course, is no stranger to obstacles, but the [Apple] changes are the first direct threat to its ad business. \"Combined with the rise of TikTok, brand safety concerns, and a shift in social media user behaviour, there's a perfect storm heading straight for Meta's ad revenues. Even so, it's clear that advertisers are still turning to Facebook and Instagram to reach their wide audiences.\" ",

            "header": "Now businesses face soaring energy bills",
            "content": "Businesses do not have the householders' protection of an energy price cap, though many have been helped by fixing their prices last autumn, before the surge in prices began. That lasts, for many, until autumn, and now is the time they are finding out how much more they will have to pay. Some, in Glasgow, are rebelling.\nSome firms can pass on extra costs to customers, including energy suppliers themselves. But for others, they face the daunting task of absorbing costs or losing custom. Barista and businessman Robbie Gray had enough of the soaring electricity bills for the Canary Girl Cafe. \"It's like staring into the abyss and not knowing what's coming,\" he says. \"I'm not the kind of person who's afraid of their bills, but the last few months, I've dreaded that little brown envelope coming through the door. \"It got so bad last month that I just cancelled my direct debit, and other businesses near me were doing the same thing, in protest. I can't make sense of what the energy companies are doing. It seems they just want to kill people and crush communities. A lot of us just won't make it through.\" The tiny roastery and café's supplier reminded him he had a contract, and a direct debit was part of it: \"They phoned me quite a few times, demanding I put it back. But I've been staunch, and refused until they reconsidered their prices. \"To be fair, I did reinstate it, because they offered me a reduced rate. So it does work.\" Gray has had difficulty getting a new roaster installed. Imported from Turkey with a wedge of import tariff following Brexit, it's gas-fired, and he couldn't get a supplier to take him on for months. Now that he has one, it was sending him estimated bills for £1,000 a month, and then £700 before he had anything switched on. He announced on Facebook last month that he was closing, provoking a flood of returning customers, so he's staying open for now. \"It was really nice to see how many cared about us - people who didn't want us to close, people we hadn't seen for a while, people coming from as far away as Edinburgh. It was a good ego boost after the stress of the past year\". Robbie does not want to put up prices, because the community around him is not prosperous. And small batch roasted coffee beans are the very essence of a discretionary product - a luxury people can do without when budgets get tight. They're getting tight for businesses as well as their customers. Firms such as Canary Girl Cafe are facing up to soaring energy costs, without the price cap that is supposed to ease the pain for households. Most of them fix their prices on an annual basis, and of them, around 80% see the new contract start on October 1 each year. That was fortuitous in 2021, because prices fixed during last summer were set before the price surge began. But for October 2022, they're going to feel a lot of pain. Energy UK, representing suppliers, says the business market differs from the residential one not only for the absence of a legal price cap but also because there is no obligation to maintain the supply. It cannot comment on Canary Girl Cafe without knowing more of its circumstances, but it is pointed out that it can be easier for a business to negotiate a deal, sometimes using a broker. And while suppliers have been hard hit by the impact of the price cap on their residential market, there is no escaping the rising wholesale costs they will pass on to commercial clients. A spokesman told BBC Scotland: \"As has been well publicised, suppliers have been facing record wholesale costs over the past year with gas prices increasing by around 500% from the start of 2021. Suppliers have to be able to recoup these costs which unfortunately, but inevitably, means higher prices. \"We realise it's a very difficult time for business customers, as well as domestic customers, with higher prices a reality for the foreseeable future.\" David Hunter, an energy analyst and client adviser for Schneider Electric, says large companies have the resources to hedge their energy supplies for years ahead. But small companies typically hedge through their suppliers, and usually for just that one year ahead. His advice is to start talking to suppliers early, finding the best deal and planning, because there will be no avoiding higher energy costs when the new contracts start. \"For some businesses, this is a real struggle,\" he says. \"There's potentially real hardship ahead. And there is no way to sugar coat the pain of the very significant increases in commodity market that have to ultimately be passed through. \"The pain on a business depends on whether they can amend their prices to reflect these costs, and that will depend from sector to sector and business to business.\" Some, such as the energy suppliers themselves, sell a product for which there is little elasticity of demand - that is, people still need to buy even when prices rise. Coffee bean roasters, particularly in low-income neighbourhoods, are vulnerable to a downturn in demand, even if they don't raise prices, and a much sharper downturn if they do. Raeburn Brick is an example of a company that retains a healthy level of demand. There used to be more than 140 brick-makers in Scotland and this one in Blantyre is the only one left on a commercial scale. More than half of its specialist product goes to England, for the olde worlde appeal of varying colour. \"Unfortunately, our contract ceases in September,\" says Jimmy Raeburn, co-founder and co-managing director with his brother, \"And we'll be facing a 200% increase in electricity costs. As far as gas is concerned, we're paying four times what we were paying in April last year, which is,\" he understates, \"quite a lot to absorb.\" Other costs are also rising. The heavy plant to extract clay from his quarry can no longer be run on red diesel, with its lower tax rate. From this month, the UK government decided that such off-road machinery requires white diesel like road vehicles, and so the price has risen three fold. The costs of packaging and wages are going up, while National Insurance contributions have just increased. So Jimmy Raeburn went to his customers, mostly wholesalers in the construction industry, and asked them to accept a 30% surcharge - a temporary increase while energy prices remain high. Almost all agreed: \"If we didn't have that surcharge in income, we would be losing money hand over fist. But how long will customers be prepared to pay this surcharge?\" The projections from his energy supplier are for prices coming down a bit in the new financial year, and down further the following year, \"but we're never going to get back to where we were\".

            "header": "Ukraine war: Should we be worried about a gas supply crisis?",
            "content": "Russian energy giant Gazprom says it has halted gas exports to Poland and Bulgaria over the countries' refusal to pay for supplies in roubles - but how worried should we be? Both Poland and Bulgaria were already planning not to renew their contracts with Gazprom, which expire at the end of the year. In Poland's case, it had been filling its stores of gas ahead of time, which provides some cushion, especially as we approach the summer lull in use of gas. This escalation is real, and justified by the Kremlin on the basis of a refusal to pay for gas by changing money into roubles in Russian bank accounts. But the additional impact of today's news should be containable. Gas prices in the UK are well down on their record peaks of £5 per therm last month, at about £1.70. UK terminals have been flooded with liquefied natural gas (LNG) - over 100 tanker-loads so far this year - with the largest amount coming from the US. But it can't be stored here, and much is being re-exported to the European Union (EU). Indeed, market contacts suggest that the export pipeline of gas from the UK to continental Europe is currently at the limits of its capacity. These UK prices are still consistent with further rises in gas bills in October - perhaps of a few hundred pounds a year. Could the world cope without Russian oil and gas?\nGermany rules out immediate ban on Russian oil All that would change, of course, if these moves today are the first skirmishes in an escalating European energy crisis that could see Germany cut off from Russian gas in the next few months. That would send prices spiralling across Europe and lead to a crisis of supply. There is some helpful ambiguity in what is termed \"forcing buyers to pay for Russian gas in roubles\". \"Various governments and companies stating 'we will not pay in roubles' therefore are not providing any clarity as to whether they will use the new payment process or not, which in turn means there is ambiguity over upcoming supply to other, larger, markets,\" says Tom Marzec-Manser, head of gas analytics at market information provider ICIS. German firms are paying in euros that are then exchanged into roubles at a specific Russian bank. This arrangement allows all to continue the mutual gas trade dependence, but it is a precarious balance. German ministers say that they are not afraid of paying the economic price to eliminate the \"strategic mistake\" of energy dependence on the Kremlin, but that they just cannot do it any time soon. So the actions of the Kremlin through Gazprom need to be put in perspective. It has cut off some supplies as a result of refusal to change the terms of payment, but notably this was to two countries which had already said their contracts with Gazprom would be allowed to expire this year. As the conflict continues, and Germany ups the ante in terms of supplies of weapons to Ukraine, the real question is about the flow of gas from Russia to Germany, which continued uninterrupted even during the height of the Cold War. This move is designed as a Kremlin shot across the bows of Europe's biggest economies. While Germany, for example, has said it is willing to phase out Russian coal in the summer, and hinted Russian oil could follow over the next year, gas is another matter. Last week, Germany's finance minister told me it would be physically impossible to immediately phase out the 45% dependence of Germany on Russia for its gas. ",

            "header": "How Elon Musk might change Twitter",
            "content": "Twitter is usually awash with topics for discussion, but over the past couple of days one has stood out on the platform above others - what does the future hold for Twitter itself? With Elon Musk set to purchase the site - subject to shareholders' approval - for $44bn (£35bn), tweeters across the world have been offering their opinions. No-one knows exactly what the billionaire entrepreneur has planned, with even Twitter boss Parag Agrawal acknowledging the future is uncertain. But the world's richest man has given some clues. A self-described \"free speech absolutist\", Mr Musk has long been vocal in his criticism of the platform's content policies, raising questions after the company banned former US President Donald Trump. He has also called for more transparency over how the platform presents tweets to users, a system that currently allows some to be promoted and given wider audiences. Exactly how Mr Musk - who has blocked people on the platform who have criticised him or his companies in the past - will alter Twitter's practices remains unclear. If the billionaire does loosen Twitter's content moderation rules, he could be in for a \"rude awakening\", says Jeffrey Howard, associate professor at University College London. Twitter could be \"easily weaponised\" by criminals, bots and people using it for \"malicious purposes\" and to \"incite hate and violence\", Mr Howard warns. \"I think Elon Musk is relatively naïve on the actual challenges involved in content moderation. He will learn as a result of this you cannot simply have a laissez-faire approach to content management.\" Who is Elon Musk?\nElon Musk wins 'pedo guy' defamation case With tough new regulation to tackle online abuse on the horizon, such as the UK government's Online Harms Bill, it is unclear what changes Mr Musk will be able to make. But news of the buyout has already generated a political firestorm. In the US, people on the right, who feel unfairly targeted by social media platforms, have welcomed the deal. Those on the left have been more critical, with Democrat Senator Elizabeth Warren calling it \"dangerous for our democracy\". Overseas, both the UK government and European Commission have reminded Mr Musk of his duty to protect the rights of Twitter users. Peter Vidlicka, media expert and co-founder of the public relations website Newspage, said that while Mr Musk could help Twitter \"get its mojo back\", \"in the current socio-cultural climate, we can expect fireworks in the months ahead\". After becoming Twitter's largest shareholder earlier in April, Mr Musk posted a series of now-deleted tweets describing possible changes to Twitter's premium subscription service Twitter Blue, like getting rid of adverts and lowering its cost. The hope would be to make subscriptions a more reliable source of income for the company, reducing its reliance on advertising. \"The power of corporations to dictate policy is greatly enhanced if Twitter depends on advertising money to survive,\" Mr Musk wrote. But analyst Rachel Foster-Jones at GlobalData says that Elon Musk might need to \"balance his dreams of a free debate space unfettered by advertising with the harsh realities of Twitter's core business model\". Adverts currently account for about 90% of its income. The company has not disclosed subscriber numbers for Twitter Blue, which launched last year in a handful of countries, including the US and Australia. \"Musk will need to seriously revamp Twitter's subscription model, Twitter Blue, if he wants to pivot away from advertising,\" Ms Foster-Jones adds. Twitter has long had an issue with automated, fake accounts being used to relentlessly post unhelpful or misleading content. Mr Musk has called for \"defeating the spam bots\" - but the task may prove harder than he thinks, warns Robin Mansell, professor of new media and the internet at the London School of Economics. There will \"always be errors\" in the authentication of users by humans or algorithms, she says. \"Anyone who offers certainty in this space is full of hype or wishful thinking,\" Prof Mansell says. \"When Musk gets immersed in the business he'll realise there are more constraints and governance arrangements to which these companies have to pay respect when they operate internationally.\" If Mr Musk were successful, it would have widespread implications, says Jamie Moles, senior sales engineer at cybersecurity firm ExtraHop. \"The methods used by Twitter to eliminate bots from the platform may generate new techniques that improve the detection and identification of spam emails, spam posts and other malicious intrusion attempts\" more widely, he says. Before his bid for Twitter, Mr Musk asked his followers if they wanted an edit button in a Twitter poll. It led to Twitter confirming that it was already working on a such a feature, which would allow users to change tweets after they have been posted. The BBC is not responsible for the content of external sites.\nView original tweet on Twitter Users have long called for an edit button but there are concerns around how to execute it. On the plus side, it would allow users to fix typos or errors in a tweet without losing any replies, retweets or likes it has already gained. But if it isn't handled well, it could affect the platform's transparency, warned Jay Sullivan, the company's vice president of consumer product, last month, Mr Sullivan has said \"without things like time limits, controls, and transparency about what has been edited\" such a feature \"could be misused to alter the record of the public conversation\".

            "content": "Tesla shares have fallen after investor concerns that boss Elon Musk may have to sell shares in the electric car maker to help pay for the takeover of Twitter. Tesla had more than $125bn (£99.3bn) wiped off its market value on Tuesday. One analyst said the slump in Tesla's value may pose problems for a $12.5bn loan Mr Musk has secured against his stake in the company. The issues highlight the challenges he faces as he tries to run five firms. Tesla's share price has taken a hammering, with some investors wondering whether Mr Musk's Twitter purchase is bad for Tesla. Shares dropped 12.2% from just over $1tn to $906bn. Some are now asking whether Elon Musk, by trying to buy Twitter, may have bitten off more than he can chew. Four ways Elon Musk might change Twitter\nElon Musk warned he must protect Twitter users\nTesla profits soar as customers pay more Mr Musk is a famous workaholic. In 2019 he was asked on Twitter whether it was true that he worked 90 hour weeks. \"In recent years, hours were much higher,\" he said. \"I don't recommend it though - bad for health and happiness.\" Mr Musk runs Tesla, the most valuable car company in the world. He also heads up Space X, a company that designs, manufactures and launches advanced rockets and spacecraft. He also founded the Boring Company, that looks to revolutionise transport through tunnelling and Neuralink, with a mission to connect humans brains with computers. That is already a lot to think about. Now Mr Musk is looking to take on one of the hardest jobs in Silicon Valley - the new owner of Twitter. Twitter isn't a normal technology company. It is a news generating machine which is influential around the world. Influencers are on TikTok, world leaders are on Twitter. And if you think Twitter's impact is consigned to the West, think again. Twitter's most followed global leader by a country mile is India's prime minister, Narendra Modi. But Twitter's huge influence comes with huge challenges. As the global \"town square\" for debate, Twitter has to decide how to moderate the platform. Mr Musk says he is a \"free speech absolutist\". But make no mistake, the platform will still need to be moderated. On Tuesday, he clarified what he meant: \"By 'free speech', I simply mean that which matches the law,\" he said. The BBC is not responsible for the content of external sites.\nView original tweet on Twitter But there are real problems with that definition. For one, the law is different in different countries. It is also often difficult to know whether a tweet breaks the law in real time. Did tweets encouraging the storming of Capitol Hill in Washington cross the line into insurrection? Where does criticism become libel? When does hate speech directed towards someone become abuse or harassment? In February, I interviewed the chief executive of Gettr, Jason Miller. He's Donald Trump's former spokesperson, and now heads up a \"free speech\" alternative to Twitter. And yet Gettr has a load of rules on what you can and can not say. \"I spend a lot of time on moderation policy, it's probably what I get enquiries from people about the most,\" he said. So Mr Musk is going to have to spend an awful lot of time thinking about, and resource the policing of Twitter, whatever happens. Twitter has some other fairly significant structural problems. Unlike its Silicon Valley peers like Facebook or YouTube, Twitter has never been very good at making money from the platform. Mr Musk believes he can turn that around. But that will take time and effort. And some are now wondering whether he has the time to be able to do that without hurting the other companies he runs. \"Unless Elon Musk has invented a way to add hours to the day, there's just only so much time that he can devote to all of this,\" says Tim Higgins, author of Power Play: Tesla, Elon Musk, and the Bet of the Century. \"I would imagine that in the next few months, years, he's going to be deeply in the weeds of Twitter. And if you're an investor in Tesla, you're probably a little nervous about that,\" Mr Higgins said. Tesla shareholders are also concerned the deal could mean his selling off a stake in the car firm. As part of the deal he has to stump up $21bn in equity himself. It is not yet clear where this money is coming from. The rest of the money is being raised by loans using Mr Musk's assets as collateral. It means that if Tesla shares begin to tumble, it could scupper a deal that is structured around the intrinsic value of those shares. \"If Tesla's share price continues to remain in freefall that will jeopardise his financing,\" Oanda senior market analyst Ed Moya said. Mr Musk is not the first entrepreneur to found multiple companies. Steve Jobs co-founded Apple and Pixar. Jack Dorsey was chief executive of Twitter and Block. But to run five companies means entrusting others to effectively run the businesses on your behalf. And that rubs up against Mr Musk's nature - who is a self-proclaimed \"nano-manager\". Last year, he said he didn't want to be chief executive of Tesla. I asked him why. He told me he didn't want to be chief executive of anything. That may be true. But he most certainly wants to be involved in the day to day running of these companies. His biographer, Walter Isaacson, said on Tuesday that Mr Musk was working at Space X when the Twitter bid was accepted. That evening he attended a 10pm meeting about engine design. \"He spent more than an hour working on valve leak solutions. No one mentioned Twitter. He can multi-task,\" he said. That Mr Musk can multi-task is without question. But will he able to spin so many plates at once, without them all coming crashing down? ",

            "content": "Food giant Kellogg's is taking the government to court over new rules that would prevent some cereals being prominently displayed in stores because of their high sugar content. Kellogg's says the rules fail to consider the nutritional value of the milk added to the product. The company says independent market data shows cereals are eaten with milk or yoghurt in 92% of cases. But the government said the new rules would help tackle childhood obesity. Under the new regulations for England, which come into force from October, retailer promotions on food and drink high in fat, salt or sugar will be restricted. Products covered by the restrictions will also not be allowed to be featured in key locations such as checkouts, store entrances, aisle ends and their online equivalents. Popular brands such as Crunchy Nut Corn Flakes and Fruit and Fibre are classified as foods that are high in fat, sugar or salt in their dry form and so retailers may be prevented from displaying such products in prominent positions, harming sales. Including added milk would change the calculation by reducing the proportion of sugar and salt content relative to the weight of the overall serving. How bad is our obesity problem?\nJunk food TV adverts to be banned before 9pm\nSugar reduction in food well below target of 20% In a statement, Kellogg's said it had \"tried to have a reasonable conversation with government\" over the issue without success - hence their legal challenge. Chris Silcock, Kellogg's UK Managing Director, said: \"We believe the formula being used by the government to measure the nutritional value of breakfast cereals is wrong and not implemented legally. It measures cereals dry when they are almost always eaten with milk. \"All of this matters because, unless you take account of the nutritional elements added when cereal is eaten with milk, the full nutritional value of the meal is not measured.\" However, some food campaigners disagreed. Caroline Cerny, from the Obesity Health Alliance, said: \"This is a blatant attempt by a multinational food company to wriggle out of vital new regulations that will limit their ability to profit from marketing their unhealthy products. \"It's shocking that a company like Kellogg's would sue the government over its plans to help people be healthier rather than investing in removing sugar from their cereals.\" A Department of Health and Social Care spokesperson said: \"Breakfast cereals contribute 7% - a significant amount - to the average daily free sugar intakes of children. \"Restricting the promotion and advertising of less healthy foods is an important part of the cross-government strategy to halve childhood obesity by 2030, prevent harmful diseases and improve healthy life expectancy, so we can continue to level up health across the nation.\" The BBC understands the government is determined to fight Kellogg's legal case as it might allow other producers to suggest ways their products' fat, sugar and salt content could be reduced if served with other ingredients, in a way it feels could undermine the new regulations. A hearing on the issue begins later at the Royal Courts of Justice in London. ",

            "content": "Reaction among current and former Twitter employees to news that the firm may be acquired by Elon Musk has been mixed. For some, like Ned Miles, Monday turned out to be \"another extremely normal day working at this extremely normal company\". He tweeted: \"Can someone just tell me if I'm rich or fired please?\" The BBC is not responsible for the content of external sites.\nView original tweet on Twitter Twitter's board has endorsed Mr Musk's acquisition of the company, and while others have kept their counsel, its most senior member lent the deal his support. Jack Dorsey, the platform's co-founder, tweeted: \"Elon is the singular solution I trust. I trust his mission to extend the light of consciousness.\" Others did not share Mr Dorsey's confidence in the Tesla and SpaceX founder's ability to take Twitter to a higher plane. Bruce Daisley was at one point Twitter's most senior employee outside the US, in his role of vice-president across Europe, Middle East and Africa. Speaking to the Jeremy Vine show on BBC Radio 2, he questioned Mr Musk's idea that a renewed focus on free speech would prove popular. He said Twitter had at one point been the \"free speech wing of the free speech party\" but the result had been that many people, particularly women and those in the public eye, had been subject to abuse: \"So that free speech angle has definitely been tried. And I do wonder what Elon's plan would be beyond that, really.\" And former board member Bijan Sabet wished that the offer had been rejected, just as the company had rejected an offer from Facebook 14 years earlier. The BBC is not responsible for the content of external sites.\nView original tweet on Twitter On Monday, chief executive Parag Agrawal and chair of Twitter's board of directors Bret Taylor, attempted to answer employees' questions. The New York Times reported that concerns raised included that Mr Musk would undo the years of work cleaning up the \"toxic corners\" of the platform, and fears that he would upset Twitter's culture, with his unpredictable management style. CNN reported that one employee asked what Musk's takeover could mean for Twitter's \"commitment to responsible, ethical artificial intelligence and machine learning\". Mr Agrawal, the network reported, said \"we need to continue doing that work\". Twitter has previously spent time exploring the political and racial biases of its algorithms. Mr Musk has pledged to make the company's recommendation algorithms open-source, to increase trust. But some Twitter staff working in the field of machine learning have been critical of allowing Mr Musk a role in running the company. Rumman Chowdhury, Twitter's director of machine leaning ethics, transparency, and accountability, had previously tweeted that a Musk takeover could lead to a staff exodus, and she supported a previous decision not to appoint him to the firm's board of directors. Since the Board's support for Mr Musk's offer, Ms Chowdhury shared tweets from colleagues. One tweet said: \"I don't know what Twitter the platform or Twitter the workplace is going to look like going forward, but right now, it feels like maybe some things are just too good, too magical to last. Only time will tell.\" Another said: \"Many at Twitter now face a likely owner who has publicly belittled them, their families, their friends or their communities\". But journalist Casey Newton, writing in the Verge, said that some employees were \"open to the idea that a private Twitter run by Musk stands a better chance of improving the service than would a public company beholden to its shareholders\". They liked, he wrote, Mr Musk's desire \"to eliminate harmful bots and bring more clarity to how recommendation algorithms work\". ",

            "content": "Elon Musk has been warned he must protect Twitter users from harmful content after he struck a $44bn deal to buy the social media giant. The billionaire vowed to relax content restrictions, sparking fears from human rights groups it could lead to a rise in bullying and misinformation. \"Regardless of ownership, all social media platforms must be responsible,\" Boris Johnson's spokesman said. The European Commission also warned Mr Musk that he must protect users. \"Be it cars or social media, any company operating in Europe needs to comply with our rules - regardless of their shareholding,\" Thierry Breton, commissioner for the internal market at the EU executive, warned in a tweet. The European Union has said its new online rules will \"overhaul\" the digital market, including how tech giants operate. Once they come into force, there will need to be greater transparency around why content is recommended to users, or why they are being targeted with certain ads, for example. Mr Musk, who is a self-described \"free speech absolutist\", has been vocal in his criticism of Twitter's policies on moderating content, arguing that it needs to be a genuine forum for free speech. \"Free speech is the bedrock of a functioning democracy, and Twitter is the digital town square where matters vital to the future of humanity are debated,\" he said on announcing the deal. The social media firm faces growing pressure from politicians and regulators over the content that appears on its platform. It has drawn critics from left and right over its efforts to mediate misinformation. In one of its most high-profile moves, last year it banned former US President Donald Trump, perhaps its most powerful user, citing the risk of \"incitement of violence\". But in a series of tweets Twitter founder Jack Dorsey, who still sits on the firm's board, welcomed Mr Musk's takeover, describing him as \"the singular solution I trust\". Elon Musk strikes deal to buy Twitter for $44bn\nWhy Elon Musk has been so keen to buy Twitter\nWho is Elon Musk? He said the firm had been \"owned\" by Wall Street and that Mr Musk's decision to delist the shares and take it private was the \"correct first step\". Twitter \"will continue to serve the public conversation\", he said, but added he did not believe \"anyone should own or run Twitter\". But in a Twitter thread, Amnesty International said: \"We are concerned with any steps that Twitter might take to erode enforcement of the policies and mechanisms designed to protect users. \"The last thing we need is a Twitter that wilfully turns a blind eye to violent and abusive speech against users, particularly those most disproportionately impacted, including women, non-binary persons, and others.\" Twitter did not immediately respond to a BBC request for comment on the concerns raised. The 11-member board of Twitter unanimously agreed to Mr Musk's $44bn (£34.5bn) offer. Twitter chief executive Parag Agrawal has also addressed employees at a meeting, where he said the future of the company was uncertain. \"Once the deal closes, we don't know which direction the platform will go,\" Mr Agrawal reportedly said. Mr Musk said that he hopes even his strongest critics will remain on the platform \"because that is what free speech means\". However, some users have threatened to leave Twitter, while others have already quit. British actor Jameela Jamil, who is best known for her role in TV series The Good Place, said she expects the platform to \"become an even more lawless, hateful, xenophobic, bigoted, misogynistic space\". \"I would like this to be my... last tweet,\" Ms Jamil told her one million followers. The BBC is not responsible for the content of external sites.\nView original tweet on Twitter Meanwhile, Caroline Orr Bueno, a post-doctoral researcher at the University of Maryland, said that for now she will stay on the platform, where she has more than 450,000 followers. Ms Bueno said \"we have no idea what it will look like under Elon Musk's leadership\". \"What we do know is that if all the decent people leave, it'll get bad here a whole lot faster,\" she added. The BBC is not responsible for the content of external sites.\nView original tweet on Twitter Dan Ives, an analyst at investment firm Wedbush Securities, told the BBC that he expected most users to \"take a wait-and-see approach\". \"Now it's about courting new users and stopping defectors from the platform,\" Mr Ives said. On Monday, White House spokesperson Jen Psaki told reporters that US President Joe Biden \"has long been concerned about the power of large social media platforms\", regardless of whoever owns or runs Twitter. Democrat Senator Elizabeth Warren said the deal was \"dangerous for our democracy\", while pushing for a wealth tax and \"strong rules to hold Big Tech accountable\". Meanwhile, Republican Senator Marsha Blackburn welcomed the agreement as \"an encouraging day for freedom of speech\". ",

            "content": "Supermarket chain Lidl has said it will pay a finder's fee to anyone who can find a suitable site for a new store as it targets 1,100 sites by 2025. The fee will be either 1.5% of a freehold price or 10% of the first year's rent for leasehold sites. For a £1.5m site purchase, Lidl says this would equal a fee of £22,500. The UK's sixth largest supermarket, which currently has 920 sites, has been growing rapidly and taking market share from the big four supermarket chains. According to research firm Kantar, over the 12 weeks to 17 April, Lidl and rival discounter Aldi were the fastest growing UK grocers. The rising cost of living has led to fierce competition between supermarkets on price. On Thursday, Asda and Morrisons said they were cutting prices on hundreds of products as they try to compete. Tesco vows to rein in prices as profits treble\nFood boss says prices could rise by up to 15%\nWhy are prices rising so quickly? Announcing the finder's fee plan, Lidl chief development officer Richard Taylor said the fees were \"available to absolutely anyone who can identify a viable option for a new store that we're not already aware of, and we welcome any suitable suggestions\". The retailer has published a list of locations across the country where it is interested in opening stores. This includes places such as Bristol, Liverpool, Manchester and Southampton. To get the fee, members of the public will have to identify locations that meet the company's site specifications. Lidl says the finder will receive 50% of the fee at exchange and the other 50% at completion. ",

            "header": "Call for extra bank holiday to be made permanent",
            "content": "Business leaders have urged the prime minister to make this year's extra bank holiday marking the Queen's Platinum Jubilee permanent. In an open letter, the CBI, UK Hospitality and a host of well-known brands said a \"thank holiday\" would honour the monarch and public service. They argued that the new holiday would provide an economic boost after Covid. Research by PwC also says government figures have overestimated the cost of a new bank holiday by about £500m. This year's extra day off is set to take place on 3 June. In an open letter to Prime Minister Boris Johnson and Chancellor Rishi Sunak, signatories said that making the holiday permanent would \"provide a moment every year for individuals and communities to come together, to thank those who have contributed in ways big and small to making our country a better place to live\". They included the bosses of Siemens and Punch Pubs and the chairman of the Campaign for Real Ale, as well as investor and entrepreneur Deborah Meaden, who is leading the campaign. The Dragons' Den star said the move would provide \"the country with a social and economic stimulus we need after a difficult few years\". Any decision to make the extra bank holiday permanent would be taken by ministers at the Department for Business, Energy & Industrial Strategy (Beis), and there are no plans to make such a move. Ministers are concerned that an extra bank holiday would come at a significant cost to the UK economy. It comes as research by PwC commissioned for the campaign suggests that the government's existing figures have previously overestimated the potential cost of a new bank holiday. Government modelling would put the cost of an extra bank holiday at £1.36bn, PwC says, taking into account the impact on business of closures, disruption to production schedules, and premium payments to staff working on the bank holiday. However, PwC has estimated the cost to be about £831m. Bank holidays are created under the Banking and Financial Dealings Act 1971, or are created by royal proclamation - that is, by the Queen, who acts on government advice. The department responsible for bank holidays is the Department of Business, Energy and Industrial Strategy. Bank holidays are not actually statutory holidays, although most workers do get the day off. Read more: Nine things you might not know about bank holidays PwC points out that social positives might have been missed out, and that sectors such as retail and hospitality, which were badly affected during the pandemic, would benefit from an uplift in demand. The findings also suggest that any knock-on costs would be lower if the new bank holiday were scheduled for a Friday because fewer hours are worked that day on average. England and Wales currently have eight bank holidays annually, in comparison with the European Union average of 11. But in many countries if a bank holiday falls at the weekend, workers are not entitled to an additional day off. So in practice workers don't always enjoy as many holidays as the officially listed days suggest. According to analysis by Visit England of the 2019 August Bank Holiday, about a third of people used the opportunity to visit friends or family, or go out for a meal. Kate Nicholls, chief executive of UK Hospitality, said that the sector would be \"ready to embrace this important tribute\", although opening hours may be restricted during a new bank holiday and businesses might need to find additional staffing cover. The campaign has also been backed by the TUC, Iceland and the Royal Voluntary Service. The trade union previously called for four additional bank holidays per year, describing the current number as \"stingy\". At the time, the Department for Business said that the cost to the economy was \"considerable\", even if certain sectors might see additional income. ",

            "header": "Government borrowing halves as Covid costs fall",
            "content": "Government borrowing in the last financial year more than halved from the amount borrowed a year earlier when the UK saw major Covid restrictions. Borrowing - the difference between spending and tax income - stood at £151.8bn, less than half the £317.6bn borrowed in 2020-21, figures showed. The government has had to borrow less since pandemic schemes, such as furlough, have come to an end. It also made more income from taxes which has helped cover the gap. The Office for National Statistics said the government received much stronger than expected revenues from taxes, with receipts at £619.9bn for the financial year, an increase of £94.3bn. However, borrowing in March remained well above pre-pandemic levels. At £18.1bn, the figure was the second-highest amount for the month since records began in 1993, but was £8.8bn less than the the amount borrowed in March 2021. The ONS said the total amount the government borrowed in the last financial year was worth about 6.4% of gross domestic product (GDP). It was also almost 20% higher than forecast by the Office for Budget Responsibility last month, which said it expected borrowing in 2021-22 to be £127.8bn. Where does the government borrow billions from? Despite the fall in government borrowing from the previous year, it is still the third-highest level for a financial year since records began in 1947. It also comes as Chancellor Rishi Sunak is under pressure to provide support for households and businesses hit by rising prices. The pick-up in inflation has also led to government debt interest payments to reach a record high for a financial year at £69.9bn. In response to the latest figures, Mr Sunak said: \"Thanks to the action we've taken, the economy is recovering and our public finances are improving. \"Public debt is at the highest levels since the 1960s and rising inflation is pushing up our debt interest costs, which mean we must manage public finances sustainably to avoid saddling future generations with further debt.\" Labour's shadow chancellor, Rachel Reeves, said: \"These figures will be of little comfort to those facing soaring bills and rising prices. \"The Conservatives must urgently bring an emergency Budget forward to stop the cost of living crisis spiralling even more.\" Liberal Democrat Treasury spokesperson Christine Jardine said: \"Families across the country are struggling with soaring energy bills, rising food prices and unfair Conservative tax hikes. They desperately need a tax cut to help them make ends meet. \"These figures reveal that Rishi Sunak raked in a £9bn VAT windfall last year. He should be using that money to help families with an emergency VAT cut now.\" Samuel Tombs, chief UK economist at Pantheon Macroeconomics, suggested the latest public finance figures were \"unlikely to make the Treasury anxious\", adding that recent estimates of borrowing had been revised down \"significantly, as more data have been collated\".

Its analysis suggests that branches have been shutting at a faster rate in rural areas than in urban ones. Which? has joined up with other consumer and business groups to call on the government to legislate soon on protecting access to cash. The Treasury said it recognises cash remains \"vital\" to millions of people. The consumer group wrote a letter to the Treasury on Monday calling for urgent action. \"With rising living costs placing additional pressure on people's personal finances, the consequences of being unable to withdraw cash for those consumers who already rely on it could be significant,\" it said. \"Unless legislation is introduced urgently, the ability to access, spend and deposit cash could be permanently lost for many consumers, leaving some of society's most disadvantaged at risk of financial exclusion with no way to pay for the goods and services they need in their daily lives.\" Rival banks join forces to protect future of cash\nAppointment-only afternoon banking at Santander It is also backed by other organisations such as Age UK, StepChange Debt Charity, the British Retail Consortium, the Money and Mental Health Policy Institute, and the Federation of Small Businesses (FSB). The national chair of the FSB, Martin McTague, who sits on the Access to Cash Pilots Board, said that the upcoming Queen's Speech next month was the \"last chance saloon where protecting access to cash is concerned\". Which?'s new analysis suggested that since 2015, 4,685 bank branches have shut their doors. A further 226 are already scheduled to close by the end of the year, it said, while the rate of closures in rural areas has outstripped those in urban areas. Since 2015, the banking network in rural constituencies has been cut by half (50.7%), compared with 47.3% in urban areas. It also identified 17 parliamentary constituencies that have particularly poor access to cash - with three or fewer bank branches and 30 or fewer free-to-use ATMs. People aged 65 and over make up about a quarter on average of the population across those 17 areas that Which? said have poor access to cash. Carmarthen East and Dinefwr in Wales, for example, have lost 13 out of 15 bank branches since 2015, and have a relatively high proportion of elderly residents. According to recent statistics from the UK's Financial Conduct Authority, most people do have reasonable access to cash through a combination of bank, building society or Post Office branches and ATMs. But it did find that people in rural areas have to travel further on average to deposit or withdraw cash. Helen Miller, who lives in Wales, faces the double challenge of having to find an ATM and then making sure it is one she can access. An arthritic condition means the 50 year old uses a wheelchair when she is out and requires lots of rest. The former midwife often has to ask her husband to collect cash on her behalf, although that means she has to rely on using his account too. \"I have not been to an ATM for months. It is a lot more complicated that you can imagine,\" she said. \"It is the lack of independence that it the problem. I don't really want to rely on somebody else. \"I would just like to be able to go to one place - go to the High Street, get some money out and go to the shop like everyone else.\" Although fewer people are strictly using cash, those who do tend to be from more vulnerable backgrounds, older or have very low incomes. John Howells, the boss of the free-to-use ATM network Link, said: \"While cash usage has fallen by around 40% since the start of the pandemic, millions of consumers including some of the most vulnerable still rely on cash every day. \"Link believes that consumers in every community across the UK should have free access to cash and works with the industry to maintain it.\" Late last year, the Access to Cash Action Group also set out plans on how the industry could ensure access for those most vulnerable people. Suggested solutions included shared bank hubs, free ATMs, as well as shops offering cashback without purchases. A Treasury spokesperson said: \"We know that cash remains vital for millions of people and we are committed to protecting access to cash across the UK. \"That's why we have consulted on plans for new laws to make sure people only need to travel a reasonable distance to pay in or take out cash, and have already legislated to enable shops to offer cashback to customers without them having to make a purchase.\" The spokesperson added that the Treasury would set out plans \"in due course\" following the consultation.

            "content": "Trading in Twitter's shares have been halted amid reports the firm could agree a takeover deal with Elon Musk as early as Monday. The board of the social media giant is reported to have met with Mr Musk over the weekend to discuss his $43bn offer. Twitter had initially rebuffed the billionaire's approach. But according to reports, Twitter is now in the final stages of negotiations with Mr Musk to buy the business. Reuters, the news agency, reported that an announcement may come later on Monday after Twitter's board met and recommended a deal to its shareholders. In trading earlier on Monday, shares rose more than 5%, approaching Mr Musk's offer price of $54.20 a share. Mr Musk's targeting of Twitter has moved at remarkable speed. It emerged at the beginning of April that Mr Musk, who is the boss of electric carmaker Tesla, had become the largest shareholder in Twitter with a 9.2% stake. He was then invited to join Twitter's board but turned down the offer before launching a surprise bid for the company on 14 April, saying he wanted to \"unlock\" the social media platform's \"extraordinary potential\". Twitter responded by putting in place a so-called \"poison pill\" defence to fend off Mr Musk. The mechanism would have created difficulties for Mr Musk if he attempted to increase his stake in the company. The board now appears to have U-turned after Mr Musk revealed he had lined up a $46.5bn financing package for his offer - with funding from a mixture of his own assets and the backing of Wall Street banking giant Morgan Stanley and other firms. Mr Musk recently said that he believes that Twitter should be more open and transparent. \"I think it's very important for there to be an inclusive arena for free speech,\" he told the TED2022 conference in Vancouver. The billionaire, who is the world's richest man according to Forbes magazine, has also hinted at his plans for Twitter. He asked his 83.3 million followers on Twitter if the social media platform should allow people to edit their posts - 74% of those who responded wanted an edit button. Mr Musk's has also criticised Twitter's process of verifying a Twitter account which he said was like \"if Kafka had a Magic 8-Ball!\". Even Twitter itself didn't appear to take Elon Musk seriously when he first said that he wanted to buy it. It's just Musk being, well, Musk, everyone thought. He may be the world's richest man but he is also by his own admission cash-poor - and he is well-versed in posting unsubstantiated grand ideas on social media. But underestimate him at your peril. He is a multi-billionaire and Twitter is one of his favourite toys - so he's come back with a funded $43bn offer that the firm's shareholders are now looking likely to accept. Twitter hasn't explicitly explained why it didn't initially want to become part of Mr Musk's empire. Certainly any social media firm with regulators breathing down their necks is going to be wary of a new owner who wants to \"open up\" the platform to more freedom of speech and less moderation. He's also keen on subscription rather than advertising as a business model, which may prove a hard sell for a platform that has not experienced significant user growth in ages. A Musk-owned Twitter would have a very different feel, for sure. But he also brings to it his own brand of magic -criticise him on social media and you'll soon bear the brunt of devoted fans who idolise him. Twitter may decide to try to find an alternative buyer but Musk's star quality would be difficult to substitute. He also recently tweeted: \"If our Twitter bid succeeds, we will defeat the spam bots or die trying\"…..And authenticate all real humans.\" The BBC is not responsible for the content of external sites.\nView original tweet on Twitter It is not clear who would run Twitter if Mr Musk's bid succeeds. He is the chief executive as well as the \"Technoking\" of Tesla according to the company's website. He is also chief executive, chief technology officer and chairman of rocket and spacecraft firm SpaceX. Mr Musk is also involved in a number of other businesses and start-ups. Twitter is led by chief executive Parag Agrawal, who took on the role last November with the backing of co-founder and former boss Jack Dorsey. At the time, Mr Dorsey said: \"My trust in Parag as Twitter's chief executive is deep. I'm deeply grateful for his skill, heart, and soul. It's his time to lead.\" Mr Musk has been critical of Twitter's management. In his offer document, he told Twitter's chairman Bret Taylor: \"I don't have confidence in management.\" Mr Agrawal has not discussed the takeover on the platform since earlier this month, when he announced that Mr Musk had turned down an offer to sit on the company's board, a decision he said would be \"for the best\".

            "content": "Car maker Nissan is to stop producing vehicles under the Datsun name, which has a more than century-long history. It was one of the brands that helped Japanese car makers become established globally after the Second World War. Despite selling millions of cars around the world, the Datsun name was phased out in the 1980s. The company revived the brand three decades later, describing the new range of vehicles as \"an important part of Nissan's DNA\". On Monday, Nissan spokesperson Azusa Momose told the BBC that the firm will continue to sell its stock of Datsun cars and provide aftersales services to their owners. \"We can reassure all existing and future Datsun owners that customer satisfaction remains our priority,\" she added. Before the Datsun brand name came into being, a car named the DAT was built in 1914 by the Kaishinsha Motorcar Works in Tokyo. The word DAT was an acronym of the family names of three early investors in the business: Den, Aoyama and Takeuchi. It also literally means 'lightning fast' in Japanese. At the same time, it was promoted as Durable, Attractive and Trustworthy, or DAT for short. Nissan boss warns no end in sight to chip shortage In 1933, Nissan's founder Yoshisuke Aikawa took over the business. The early 1930s also saw the company launch an economical and lightweight car named \"DAT-son\" or \"the son of DAT\". The name was subsequently changed to \"Datsun\". Datsun was one of the brands that helped Japanese car makers establish themselves in Europe, the US and Asia after World War II. It was one of the main brands Nissan marketed globally, besides the mainstream Nissan and the luxury Infiniti. In the 1970s, the fuel-efficient Datsun was marketed as the choice of the everyday motorist looking for an alternative to unreliable gas-guzzlers. Around 20 million Datsun cars were sold in 190 countries across the world. However, the name was phased out from 1981, with Nissan becoming the company's primary brand globally. In 2012, Nissan announced the return of the Datsun brand and sold cars under the name in countries including India and Indonesia. At the time, like many rival car manufacturers, Nissan faced weak markets in Europe and the US and was targeting emerging economies with lower priced models. Despite this, sales of the models have slumped in recent years. Nissan said on Monday that it will now focus on \"core models and segments that bring the most benefit to customers, dealer partners and the business\" as part of a global transformation strategy. ",

            "content": "A greater number of people are borrowing more and expecting to save less as the rising cost of living bites in the UK, official figures suggest. Nearly one in five (17%) said they were borrowing more than they did a year ago, based on a survey conducted in March. Some 43% said they would not be able to save money in the next 12 months. At no time in the past two years has that figure been any higher, the Office for National Statistics (ONS) said. Surging price rises, for essentials such as food and fuel, have affected household budgets in recent months. The chief reason for the squeeze has been the rising cost of gas and electricity. The ONS survey was conducted before a 54% rise in domestic energy bills took effect in April, but still takes into account the general trend of sharply rising prices, as measured by inflation. The survey also showed that 23% of adults reported that it was either very difficult or difficult to pay their usual household bills in the previous month, compared with a year earlier. That was a higher proportion that the 17% of adults who gave the same answer in November last year. Even though the steepest rise in energy bills had yet to kick in, among those who pay energy bills, 43% reported that it was very or somewhat difficult to afford them. The vast majority of people (87%) said their cost of living had risen in the previous month. Those hit harder were those renting properties and people living in less affluent areas, the figures showed. \"While rising household bills will affect most households across the country, they are more likely to disproportionately affect those in the most deprived areas,\" the ONS said. Laura Suter, from investment platform AJ Bell, said: \"Those who had already taken on debt will have had to borrow more and we will undoubtedly see more people turning to debt in the coming months as their pandemic savings run dry. \"Anyone struggling to meet the cost of their basic bills or housing costs needs to take action now, as the cost of living crisis is not going away any time soon. We are facing another increase in energy bills later this year and expected further rises to the Base Rate means that housing and borrowing costs are also likely to jump.\" How have you been affected by the issues in this story? haveyoursay@bbc.co.uk.

            "content": "Two \"regular dads\" have been chosen for an innovation and trade award for their portable sleep aid devices. In 2015 Dr Nick Webb and his brother-in-law Matt Dyson developed Rockit - a mechanical device that attaches to a buggy and simulates it being pushed. Dr Webb said: \"I invented our first product to help my own daughter to sleep when her pram stopped moving.\" The pair will collect their Queen's Awards for Enterprise at Buckingham Palace in July. The device now sells in more than 40 countries. Mr Dyson, 53, called it a \"real whirlwind\" and a \"fantastic achievement. He said Dr Webb, who has a background in vibration and acoustic engineering, had the idea for the sleep aid because he was frustrated at not being able to stop for a coffee or a meal and noticed other parents experienced this problem too. Designing the prototype he took an old printer motor apart, and soldered together a \"rudimentary circuit\". \"He gaffer-taped some nuts and bolts to the spindle and then gaffer-taped that to the stroller,\" Mr Dyson said. When Dr Webb took Abby out the next day she remained asleep in her pram when they stopped and he \"had his cup of coffee as he'd hoped\". He showed Mr Dyson the prototype at a family Christmas party and the latter quit his job as a design technology teacher to start developing the product. They worked together with co-founder and fireman Matt Sparrow to bring their invention to market. It was released in 2017 after being improved in a shed in Portishead.

            "content": "Twitter's board reportedly met Elon Musk over the weekend to explore his $43bn (£33.6bn) takeover offer for the social media platform. After the Tesla boss first revealed his bid, Twitter's management announced a so-called \"poison pill\" strategy to fend off a potential hostile buyout. Mr Musk plans to finance his bid with the backing of US lender Morgan Stanley and other financial institutions. A spokesperson for Twitter declined to comment on the reports. Details of how Mr Musk intended to finance his offer, which were disclosed to US regulators on Thursday, made Twitter's 11-member board seriously consider a possible deal, according to Reuters, the New York Times and Bloomberg - citing anonymous sources. Mr Musk, who owns a more than 9% stake in Twitter, has lined up a $46.5bn financing package for his bid, according to a regulatory filing. The funding will come from a mixture of his own assets and the backing of Wall Street banking giant Morgan Stanley and other firms. A number of Twitter shareholders reportedly contacted the company after Mr Musk announced the financing plan and urged it not to miss the opportunity for a potential deal. Twitter board takes action to fight Musk bid\nElon Musk 'not sure' his Twitter bid will succeed Dan Ives, an analyst at investment firm Wedbush Securities, said many investors will view the discussions \"as the beginning of the end for Twitter as a public company, with Musk likely now on a path to acquire the company unless a second bidder comes into the mix\". A hostile takeover attempt by Mr Musk, who is the world's richest person, would put \"further pressure on the board with their backs against the wall in this Game of Thrones battle for Twitter,\" Mr Ives added. Earlier this month, Mr Musk refused a seat on Twitter's board, which would have limited the shares he was allowed to own. He then made made an unsolicited offer for the company on 14 April. The next day, Twitter's board announced a plan to protect itself against a potential hostile takeover by adopting what is known as a \"limited-duration shareholder rights plan\", also known as a \"poison pill\". The move deters anyone from having more than a 15% stake in the company. It does this by allowing others to buy additional shares in the firm at a discount. A takeover bid is considered to be hostile when a person or business tries to take over another company against the wishes of the target firm's management. ",

            "content": "The UK's aviation watchdog should have stronger powers to protect passengers hit by the kind of disruption caused by the pandemic, MPs have recommended. The sector was hit hard by efforts to tackle the virus, including quarantine, testing regimes and travel bans. The Civil Aviation Authority should have \"more teeth\" to be able to fine airlines not giving refunds, a Commons Transport Committee report said. It also called for ministers to publish an aviation recovery plan by June. Aviation was one of the industries most affected by measures put in place to stop the spread of coronavirus. International travel was banned or heavily restricted in the early months of 2020 after the virus began to spread around the globe, and many customers had flights and holidays cancelled. When travel could resume, passengers were still subject to measures such as Covid testing, quarantine and passenger locator forms. And the government's traffic light system of categorising overseas countries meant flying into the UK from some destinations was still subject to bans, with changes to the \"red list\" every few weeks during the latter months of 2021 leaving people having to cancel trips at short notice or head home early. Travel firms confident sector will bounce back\nHeathrow warns return to normal travel years away\nWill travel return to normal this summer? In its report, UK Aviation: Reform For Take-Off, the Commons committee says that the regulator, the CAA, should be given the power to impose financial penalties on airlines that do not completely refund customers when required to do so by law. It notes some Ryanair passengers are still waiting for compensation four years after being impacted by a 2018 pilot strike, because of the airline legally challenging CAA enforcement action. The committee also called for an airline insolvency bill to be introduced in the next session of parliament to better protect consumers, employees and taxpayers. Paul Smith, Consumer Director at the CAA, said: \"We have regularly asked for stronger consumer enforcement powers, including the ability to impose fines on airlines. This would allow us to take faster action when appropriate and bring our powers in line with other sectoral regulators.\" The MPs welcomed ministers' pledges to only apply travel restrictions in \"extreme circumstances\" in future, and said the government \"must compensate the industry for the economic loss suffered\" if measures impacting the sector were reimposed. And plans should be established to ensure swift Covid testing is put in place if required by other countries, the MPs said. \"Now that government has removed all coronavirus-related restrictions on international travel, ministers must get on with protecting the sector against future economic shocks,\" said Huw Merriman, the Transport Committee chairman. The Conservative MP said the government had faced a difficult situation but some inconsistent policies had left industry and passengers confused. UK air travel sees huge slump in 2021 due to Covid\nWarning travel problems could continue into summer\nHeathrow passenger numbers lowest for 50 years A report by the National Audit Office last week said there had been no system to assess the success of measures such as the traffic light system, self-isolation, testing, quarantine hotels or passenger locator forms. And consumer group Which? said the CAA should have greater powers after travellers faced long delays over Easter, with security issues causing many to miss flights. After shedding thousands of jobs during the pandemic, the travel industry has struggled to recruit, train and security-check new staff quickly enough to keep up with rebounding demand, leading to lengthy queues at airports as international travel picked up this year. Tim Alderslade, CEO of Airlines UK, said: \"We can't lose sight of the fact the sector has been through its worst ever crisis and it will take several years to deal with the debt airlines had to take on to make it through the pandemic with no passengers.\" FOOD POVERTY EXPLAINED: How to seek help and assist others\nTHE ZELENSKY INTERVIEW: Clive Myrie's exclusive talk with the Ukrainian president ",

            "content": "The UK has proposed new rules making fake reviews of goods illegal. But experts say that's not the only way companies are skewing buyer perception. Nathaniel Fuentes wanted to warn others away from the printer he purchased for his son's schoolwork last year after finding nearly every paper it spat out was blurry. But after the 36-year-old from California submitted his comment on the manufacturer's website, he got a swift reply: \"Your review has been moderated\". His feedback never appeared. And suddenly, the glowing reviews he had read before buying the printer looked a whole lot more suspicious. \"I never would have bought it,\" he says. \"I won't do business with them anymore.\" Surveys show roughly 90% of shoppers use product reviews to inform their purchases. But the information they glean can be unreliable. The UK recently proposed rules that would make writing and commissioning fake reviews illegal. But while much of the attention has focused on the problem of fake reviews, experts say sellers are distorting customer perception in other ways as well, using practices like displaying reviews to their advantage, selectively soliciting comments - and in extreme cases, supressing bad feedback altogether. Amazon and Google probed over fake 5-star reviews\nTrustpilot wiped 2.2 million bogus reviews Potential issues and conflicts of interest related to reviews have expanded as more brands incorporate them on their own sites and take a more active role collecting them to help sales on other platforms. \"Many companies start with an honest agenda, which is to remove fake negative reviews… but when they do it, it becomes a slippery slope,\" says Prof Bin Gu of Boston University's Questrom School of Business. \"It's very hard to know when to stop.\" In January, the US Federal Trade Commission (FTC) announced a $4.2m settlement with fast fashion clothier Fashion Nova over charges it had blocked hundreds of thousands of poor customer reviews between 2015 and 2019. The agency said the firm, known for its partnerships with social media influencers and celebrities such as Cardi B, used software services that allowed four and five star comments to publish automatically, while withholding the remainder for review. The deal marked the first case to crack down on a firm for hiding bad reviews. Another recent FTC case targeted a contact lens provider, which paid $3.5m to settle charges including that it failed to disclose that it paid people for reviews. \"This is an area of priority for us,\" says FTC attorney Amber Lee, who worked on the Fashion Nova case. \"It's hard to say how widespread a problem this is but one of the reasons we bring cases like this is to send a message to the marketplace.\" Fashion Nova declined an interview. In a statement about the FTC settlement, the firm said it had relied on another company to process reviews and \"inadvertently failed to complete this process given certain resource constraints during a period of rapid growth\". The company said it had posted the relevant reviews voluntarily after being alerted to the issue in 2019 and that it \"only agreed to settle the case to avoid the distraction and legal fees that it would incur in litigation\". The complaints that Fashion Nova systematically hid any reviews below four stars suggest a \"pretty egregious case\", says Prof Dina Mayzlin of the USC Marshall School of Business, who believes large-scale suppression of reviews is unlikely given the risks of customer outcry. But, she cautions, \"there are usually more subtle ways to discourage negative reviews and encourage positive ones\". New guidelines from the FTC warn firms against practices such as displaying reviews in a \"misleading\" way, or only soliciting comments from people likely to provide praise. They also say companies must treat positive and negative reviews the same. Agency officials are also working with the UK's Competition and Markets Authority on its probe of online reviews on platforms such as Amazon and Google. The government attention has started to push companies to address the worst behaviour, experts say. Amazon for example, last year finally suspended some major sellers that had been accused of soliciting fake reviews, reportedly acting after prodding from the FTC. \"Regulators are…. trying to tackle the manipulation, but it's actually quite hard,\" says Prof Brett Hollenbeck of the UCLA Anderson School of Management, who found that sellers solicited fake reviews for some 4.5 million Amazon products in 2020. \"Given the importance that we have learned that reviews make for people's purchase decisions, there's a very strong incentive for a company to manipulate the ratings and reviews they're getting.\" Keith Nealon is chief executive of BazaarVoice, a Texas-based company that works with more than 13,000 brands, handling more than 100 million reviews a year. He says his team, which consists of 1,200 full-time employees and hundreds of part-time moderators, typically rejects about 8% of reviews after automated screening for fakes, due to issues like profanity and irrelevance - if the comments refer to shipping, for example, rather than the product. But he says simply suppressing bad reviews is a \"limited\" practice industry-wide. His firm, which did not work with Fashion Nova, requires clients to allow comments to flow through regardless of star ratings. He is hopeful that scrutiny by regulators will help to convince brands of what his firm has long-advised: that allowing poor reviews to be published can build trust in the brand and confidence in online shopping. \"This is moving the industry in the right direction which we welcome,\" he says. For some shoppers, however, the damage has been done. Former Fashion Nova customer Lauren Curry tried to alert the clothier to a missing order in 2017 - only to have her complaints scrubbed from the firm's social media sites. The 29-year-old from South Carolina says the experience permanently soured her perception of Fashion Nova - and made her wary of unfamiliar companies promoted on social media. \"You don't know who's legit,\" she says. As for Nathaniel, after more online research he did purchase another printer. But this time, he says, he didn't buy until seeing it in person. \"We live in a time with a real lack of trust,\" he says. \"Before, it used to be something that was really easy to say, 'Hey - it's a high review. I can go buy it.' Now it's kind of muddied.\" ",

            "content": "A year since wrongful convictions of subpostmasters were first overturned, most say they are no closer to agreeing a financial compensation settlement. They were wrongly accused of theft and false accounting by the Post Office due to faulty software. One victim, Jo Hamilton, told the BBC: \"Subpostmasters have lost everything and they need it to be given back.\" The Post Office said it wanted to provide \"full, fair and final settlements\". The case has been described as the most widespread miscarriage of justice in legal history. The faulty software installed in the post offices made it look like money had been going missing from branches. Thirty nine individuals had their convictions quashed by the Court of Appeal in April 2021, paving the way for more than 30 others to have their convictions overturned since then. Ms Hamilton, who had a criminal conviction hanging over her for 12 years, has told the BBC's Panorama programme that \"justice would be for everyone to be put back to where they would have been had none of this happened\". The Post Office has agreed to make interim payments of up to £100,000 to most of those who have had their convictions quashed. However, the solicitor representing many of the victims says his clients are still a long way from reaching any final settlements. Why were hundreds of sub-postmasters prosecuted?\nPost Office scandal ruined lives, inquiry hears Neil Hudgell said the Post Office's proposed figures for damages are not adequate for his clients. As a result he is asking for more interim payments, and pressing the government and the Post Office to ensure cases are completed by end of this year as he believes subpostmasters are \"running out of time and money\". The government has already agreed to pay the entire bill for compensation as the Post Office's sole shareholder. The Post Office said: \"We want to provide full, fair and final settlements and are urging the government, who are the funders of the compensation, to help us reach agreement with the legal representatives of the postmasters and therefore be able to make payments as soon as possible.\" But those individuals are not the only ones still waiting. There are more than 600 others who were prosecuted by the Post Office on the basis of Horizon software, with 33 individual cases currently being considered by the Criminal Cases Review Commission in England and Wales, and nine in the same process in the Scottish legal system. Of more than 2,000 others who lost out financially because of the faulty Horizon software just over half have now received an offer of compensation. Of those 892 payments have been made totalling £7.1m, and 44 applications are now in a dispute resolution process because the offer was rejected. Hundreds of others are still waiting to hear if they qualify. Many of these individuals were dismissed from their jobs, and lost their businesses without ever being criminally prosecuted. Some 555 individuals who brought a civil case against the Post Office have also been locked out of compensation. That case forced the Post Office to admit the flaws in the software, and paved the way legally for much of what has followed, and yet most of their settlement was swallowed up in legal fees. Postal Affairs Minister Paul Scully said last month that those individuals would be given the same level of compensation as others, but has yet to publish details as to how that will happen. Nicola Arch is one of that group and is frustrated to still not have any answers. \"Our lives have been spent fighting all the time which is draining, especially when we have more fighting left to do it seems,\" she tweeted recently. A public inquiry into the scandal has spent the first two months hearing harrowing evidence from former subpostmasters in England and Wales, and will travel to Northern Ireland and Scotland in May to hear the human impact of the decisions taken by Post Office bosses. However, all victims are hoping that someone within government, the Post Office and Fujitsu, who made the Horizon software, will be held to account. But the calling of those witnesses will not get underway until the autumn, as the inquiry has announced another delay in its progress. Noel Thomas, who was wrongly jailed for nine months on a charge of false accounting, said he wants those in charge to feel some consequences. \"People in their position, being paid a lot of money, hiding the truth; make them feel like I felt when I lost everything overnight,\" he told Panorama. That celebration at the High Court last year marked a huge achievement for victims fighting a seemingly impossible battle, but it has certainly not been the end of the story. You can watch Panorama's The Post Office Scandal on BBC One on Monday 25 April at 20:00 BST in England, at 22:40 BST in Wales and Scotland, and at 22:45 BST in Northern Ireland, or via iPlayer. ",

            "header": "Carlos Ghosn: Ex-Nissan boss says he wants a trial",
            "content": "Fugitive former Nissan boss Carlos Ghosn has said he wants to stand trial on charges of financial wrongdoing in order to clear his name. He spoke to the BBC after France issued an international warrant for his arrest, citing allegedly suspect payments. Mr Ghosn said he was \"expecting\" the move though he was \"surprised at the timing\". Mr Ghosn faced charges of financial misconduct when he fled Japan in 2019. The former head of Nissan, once one of the most powerful figures in the car industry, is currently unable to leave Lebanon, as he is the subject of an Interpol Red Notice issued by Japan. He told the BBC: \"I want to stand trial because that's the only way I can get rid of the Red Notice which today forbids me from leaving Lebanon.\" He said he wanted a trial in Lebanon on the charges brought against him in Japan, and any that emerge from the French investigation - and was \"totally confident\" he could prove his innocence. The downfall of the god of cars\nEx-Nissan boss Ghosn: How I escaped Japan in a box\nFour charts on the Carlos Ghosn scandal Prosecutors in France are investigating claims that Mr Ghosn funnelled millions of euros from Renault through Suhail Bahwan Automobiles. According to reports first published in the Wall Street Journal, he used the money for personal purchases including that of a 120-foot yacht. An investigating magistrate in France has now issued five international arrest warrants against Mr Ghosn and four people linked to a car distributor in Oman. Mr Ghosn told the BBC on Friday: \"There was not one euro [from Nissan or Renault] that ended up benefitting me directly or indirectly\". He denied he was a fugitive from justice - and repeated previous claims he had left Japan because he would not have had a fair trial there. Mr Ghosn said the charges against him were part of a conspiracy to derail his plans for a full merger between Renault and Nissan. Since his escape, Carlos Ghosn has repeatedly claimed that the charges against him in Japan were baseless. They were, he maintains, part of a conspiracy, designed to prevent him from orchestrating a merger between Nissan and its French partner Renault. But for several years a separate investigation has been quietly taking place in France. An investigating magistrate recently questioned Mr Ghosn at length in Beirut. The decision to issue an international arrest warrant suggests the French side believes there is a genuine case to answer at least. Mr Ghosn has said he would be happy to stand trial in France to clear his name, and his lawyers seem confident that would happen. But there's a problem. The former executive is banned from leaving Lebanon because he is still subject to an extradition request from Japan, even though that request is highly unlikely to be granted. For the moment, he remains in a legal limbo. Mr Ghosn once ran the Renault-Nissan-Mitsubishi Alliance, one of the biggest car-making groups in the world. He was arrested in Japan in late 2018, and faced a number of charges, including claims he deliberately mis-reported his earnings and used company money to fund his own lifestyle. He denied any wrongdoing. He has previously spoken of his dramatic escape from Japan, which involved disguising himself to go unnoticed through the streets of Tokyo, being hidden in a large music equipment box and fleeing to his native Lebanon as he awaited trial. Mr Ghosn, who holds Brazilian, Lebanese and French passports, cannot be extradited to France from Beirut, although he confirmed to the BBC that he has been questioned as part of the investigation. He said he thought France had issued the arrest warrant because under its law the investigation could not be closed unless he was in French territory. \"So in a certain way we were expecting something like this to happen,\" he said. \"What was surprising was the timing...and also that we knew about it through an American newspaper...without me being officially alerted.\" Earlier, his lawyer, Jean Tamalet at King & Spalding, told the BBC: \"We believe this move is the only technical resort they found to be able in the future to try the case in a court of law.\" Warrants were also issued against the current owners and former directors of the car distributor, Suhail Bahwan Automobiles. The Omani firm did not immediately respond to a BBC request for comment. You might also be interested in: ",

            "header": "Retail sales fall as rising cost of living bites",
            "content": "UK retail sales dropped in March as the rising cost of living hit consumer spending, according to official data. Online sales fell sharply as people cut down on non-essential spending, the Office for National Statistics said. Fuel sales also dropped as people cut travel amid record petrol and diesel prices. However, overall retail sales were still above pre-Covid levels, the ONS said. Retail sales fell by an unexpected 1.4% in the month, and February's sales figures were also revised down. Darren Morgan, ONS director of economic statistics, said \"Online sales were hit particularly hard due to lower levels of discretionary spending. \"Fuel sales also fell substantially, with evidence suggesting some people reduced non-essential journeys, following record high petrol prices, while food sales continued to fall, dropping for the fifth consecutive month.\" The cost of living crisis is being driven by surges in fuel, energy and food prices, with inflation running at 7% - its highest rate for 30 years. Energy and fuel prices had been rising even before Russia's invasion of Ukraine as economies started to recover from the coronavirus pandemic, and the conflict has pushed up prices further. What is the UK's inflation rate and why is the cost of living going up?\nHow much is fuel duty and what will the cut on petrol save you?\nWhat is the energy cap and why are energy bills so high? Bethany Beckett, UK economist for Capital Economics, said inflation was set to keep rising and \"there's a real risk of an outright fall in consumer spending in the coming quarters\". The biggest contribution to the March retail sales slide came from the drop in online sales, which have been falling from pandemic highs after coronavirus restrictions eased. \"The sharp decline in sales in March suggests that households are already paring back spending to cope with higher costs for food and fuel,\" said Ms Beckett. \"That is only likely to worsen in the coming months as the cost of living crisis intensifies. After all, the March data predated April's huge 54% rise in utility bills which will have hit household budgets hard.\" Separately, a survey by GfK suggested that UK consumer confidence in April dropped to its second-lowest level in 50 years due to people's weakening confidence in the economy and in their personal finances. Consumer confidence was at its lowest ebb since July 2008, which was during the severe worldwide economic crisis, the market research firm said. by Ramzan Karmali, BBC business correspondent The bigger-than-expected fall in retail sales last month was largely down to the current cost of living crisis - that's according to ONS officials. Online sales of non-essential items fell again, and the data suggests that record high petrol prices are having a major impact with a cut in non-essential journeys. More significantly perhaps is the fact food sales have been falling since last November, which is a sign that consumers are paring back their spending to cope with higher costs. Economists believe the situation will only become more acute as March's data came before April's 54% hike in gas and electricity bills. They also point to falling consumer confidence - the survey for this in April slumped to its lowest level in 14 years. Meanwhile, a survey of businesses suggested a slowdown in private sector growth in April. The UK's dominant services sector saw growth slow sharply, the S&P Global/CIPS composite Purchasing Managers' Index indicated. Although manufacturing growth picked up slightly after a five-month low in March, new manufacturing orders from abroad fell by the most since June 2020 as orders from Europe fell back. Firms also said export orders were hit by Brexit, recent congestion in UK ports and sanctions on Russia, the survey found. There was also a sharp rise in company insolvencies in March, according to official data. The number of firms going bust rose to 2,114 in March, more than double the number in March 2021, and a third higher than pre-pandemic figures. The Bank of England has been raising interest rates to try to cool inflation, and its key rate currently stands at 0.75%. Its governor, Andrew Bailey, said on Thursday that the Bank was walking a tight line between dealing with inflation and avoiding recession. Bank of England monetary policymaker Catherine Mann said that interest rates would probably have to go up \"a little bit\" further. Asked about the risk of so-called \"stagflation\", which is a combination of slow growth and high inflation, Ms Mann said \"in some senses, we could say we're already there\" because of the jump in energy prices and slowing retail sales. \"But I think that, you know, it's premature to kind of hearken back to the 1980s or the 1970s, in the US context in particular, and use that vocabulary,\" she said.

            "content": "CNN's new owner says it will close the US-based news channel's streaming service just a month after it launched. Warner Bros Discovery (WBD) says it will issue refunds to subscribers after the service is shut down on 30 April. The head of CNN+ has resigned and hundreds more workers could be at risk of losing their jobs. This week, $50bn (£38.4bn) was wiped off the stock market value of streaming giant Netflix after it revealed a sharp fall in subscribers. CNN+ was launched on 29 March in an attempt to bring in revenues from news streaming subscriptions. The company spent as much as $300m on developing the service but it got off to a slow start, attracting just 10,000 viewers a day, according to reports. Earlier this month, WBD became CNN's parent company with the completion of the merger of media company Discovery and telecom giant AT&T. Chris Licht, incoming chief executive of CNN, said the business \"will be strongest as part of WBD's streaming strategy which envisions news as an important part of a compelling broader offering along with sports, entertainment, and nonfiction content\". \"We have therefore made the decision to cease operations of CNN+,\" Mr Licht said in a statement. Discovery's streaming boss JB Perrette said the firm was searching for a \"more sustainable business model to drive our future investments in great journalism and storytelling\". Have we seen peak Netflix?\nCNN boss resigns over undisclosed relationship As part of the shakeup, Andrew Morse, who helped to drive CNN's streaming strategy, will leave the company. Hundreds of CNN+ employees have also been given 90 days to secure a job in other parts of the company, CNN reported. Those who fail to do so will receive a severance package of at least six months pay, it said. It comes after streaming giant Netflix reported a plunge in subscribers in the first three months of the year. On Tuesday, Netflix said the number of households using its streaming service fell by 200,000 as it faced stiff competition from rivals. The platform also warned shareholders another two million subscribers were likely to leave in the three months to July. After the announcement, the company's New York-listed shares slumped by more than a third, wiping $50bn off its stock market valuation. ",

            "content": "Ukraine's president has told the world's finance ministers his country needs $7bn (£5.4bn) every month until the summer to keep functioning. Volodymyr Zelensky also said \"we will need hundreds of billions of dollars to rebuild all this later\". He was addressing an International Monetary Fund (IMF) and World Bank conference via video link from Kyiv. The World Bank has estimated that about $60bn of physical damage has so far been inflicted on Ukraine. Mr Zelensky also said the global community needed to exclude Russia immediately from international financial institutions, including the World Bank, IMF and others. All countries \"must immediately be prepared to break up all relations with Russia,\" he added. Damage to Ukraine infrastructure reaches $60bn: World Bank\nWarning of 'human catastrophe' food crisis due to invasion Asked whether the IMF would be able to secure the immediate funding that Ukraine needs, the organisation's managing director Kristalina Georgieva told BBC economics editor Faisal Islam: \"We found it for the first and second month. \"We believe that over time this amount is going to go down as the Ukrainian economy in the parts of the country that are not under occupation picks up, and as remittances from those who now work somewhere else start flowing.\" Meanwhile, US Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen said Russia should be made to pay some of the cost of rebuilding Ukraine after the war. It came as some nations have called for seized Russian assets to be used to fund the country's reconstruction. However, Ms Yellen cautioned that using seized Russian central bank reserves in the US to rebuild Ukraine would be a \"significant step\" that would need discussions and agreement with international partners. Ukrainian Prime Minister Denys Shmyhal, who attended the conference in person, said the country's economic output could decline by as much as 50%, with direct and indirect losses so far totalling $560bn. That figure is more than three times the size of Ukraine's gross domestic product (GDP), which stood at $155.5bn in 2020, according to the World Bank. \"If we do not stop this war together, the losses will increase dramatically,\" Mr Shmyhal said, adding that Ukraine would need a reconstruction programme similar to the post-World War Two Marshall Plan that helped to rebuild Europe. World Bank President David Malpass, meanwhile, said the damage to Ukraine's buildings and infrastructure from Russia's invasion had reached around $60bn and warned that the figure will rise further as the war continues. Mr Malpass said the early estimate of \"narrow\" damage costs does not include the growing economic impact on Ukraine. Also on Thursday, the US imposed further sanctions on Russian ships, while the UK targeted luxury goods including caviar, silver and diamonds with import bans and higher tariffs. But the Biden administration backed Germany's caution on the European Union proceeding too fast with further sanctions on Russian energy, saying it could cost Europe more than Russia. ",

            "header": "Have we had enough of Netflix?",
            "content": "Trying to watch some of Netflix's more recent series all the way through, says Paul Weiner, feels a bit like cramming frankfurters down your throat in a hotdog eating contest. Readers outside the US may not share the American enthusiasm for competitive hotdog swallowing. But maybe they can relate to the feeling. We've all spent the last few years, the last two especially, binge-watching, indiscriminately, too mesmerised to click the off-button. Are we maybe just a little bit sick of it? That's the fear seizing executives in Netflix's boardroom right now. That Mr Weiner, a 28-year-old artist from Denver, Colorado, who loved the streaming service at first, especially for watching old favourites like Star Trek and The Office, typifies a new mood. That after years of skyrocketing subscriber growth, people will switch off, not just their television sets, but their direct debits too. Mr Weiner is one of the hundreds of thousands who have already cancelled, prompting a moment of high drama for the company this week as its share price plummeted and confidence in its future wobbled. People have begun to ask whether Netflix's star, as the world's largest streaming service, is beginning to fade. \"Netflix lost some of my favourite shows,\" says Mr Weiner. \"And I never know which show will disappear next.\" He thinks there's more clickbait than there was - enticing teaser clips that don't live up to expectations - and some poor writing. \"There are better streaming deals than Netflix right now,\" he says. Netflix was the first to introduce households to TV-on-tap in 2007, entering popular culture with its avalanche of output, and even spawning the phrase \"Netflix and chill\" as a euphemism for staying in to have sex. But since then many other streaming services have followed Netflix's lead, including HBO, Disney, Apple and Amazon, making it an increasingly crowded market. How streaming services left us with too much to watch\nTikTok helps UK book sales hit record levels \"What made Netflix so popular initially was not necessarily its original programming, but the shows it licensed from other production companies, like Friends, giving viewers one convenient place to watch everything they love,\" says entertainment journalist Tufayel Ahmed. \"With companies now taking their shows off the service and putting them on their own streaming platforms, Netflix faces the problem of having to fill the gap.\" They've done that, launching some hugely successful original output, from the lurid regency romp Bridgerton to the brutal Squid Game, high school comedy Sex Education to the touching drama Afterlife. Sixteen million people signed up in three months at the start of 2020 as coronavirus spread the world and discussing the dubious morality of Tiger King or the historical accuracy of The Crown was a way to switch off from the horror show of the news. But with so many rivals, \"all of which are pouring hundreds of millions of dollars into competing with Netflix\", says Mr Ahmed, it was almost inevitable the company would eventually lose some ground. Mark Mulligan, media analyst at MIDiA Research agrees, pointing to a trend for \"savvy switchers\" to skip between services. \"Everyone had more time and cash during the pandemic which meant the market was artificially buoyant,\" he says. But now he thinks: \"The economy for people's attention has peaked and the amount of spare time people have has run out\". There is also a cost of living crisis to contend with, right around the world. And Netflix, rather than lowering prices has raised them, a move that should help shore up the balance sheet, but has proved unpopular with subscribers, who are themselves feeling the pinch, like 38-year-old Natalie Walters from Catford in South-East London. She hasn't cancelled, but she's switched from the premium service, which in the UK costs £15.99 a month, to the standard version at £10.99. \"It becomes about choosing what you keep and what you have to cut down or get rid of altogether,\" she says. And 55-year-old Peter Biggins, a coordinator from Norwich has done the same. \"I've been with them from the beginning. They have some good shows, but they're not the only player in the market now,\" he says. And he's not a fan of the other plan Netflix is reported to be contemplating: cracking down on customers who share passwords with other households. \"If Netflix is going to go after people who have a subscription, they're going to annoy them,\" Mr Biggins predicts. And it may not have the outcome they're hoping for. Aram Asai Munoz, a law student in Santiago, Chile, has shared a Netflix account with his parents and sister, who live in separate households, for several years. Since he first signed up - eager to tune in to crime drama Better Call Saul - the monthly cost of the service has roughly doubled, he says. Many of his friends have already cancelled over the price hikes and quality of content and he says he might well do the same if the firm does clamp down on password sharing - after all Netflix is a \"frivolity\" compared to the other bills that need paying, he says. \"Netflix somehow expects that by forbidding password sharing people will become direct new customers, but economic reality dictates the opposite: they will simply walk away from the service,\" he says. While unpopular with customers, the new strategy of raising prices and clamping down on password sharing could give the company some headroom, says Julian Aquilina, senior TV analyst at the media research firm Enders Analysis, alongside a plan to offer a cheaper service supported by advertising. But the impact will be limited. A survey of US Netflix users found only 11% used a shared log in. Some 85% were paid subscribers and the rest were on free trials, Kagan Consumer Insights found. That doesn't mean Netflix is about to lose too much ground, though, Mr Aquilina says. \"It is not like it is going to fade away anytime soon. It is a great product, people like using it,\" he says. \"The question is, how many more people it will reach in the future. Maybe it won't be as much as people expected - it seems those expectations are being reset.\" ",

            "content": "Shares in Netflix have slumped by 35% after it revealed a sharp drop in subscribers and warned millions more are set to quit the streaming service. It wiped more than $50bn off the firm's market value as experts warned it faced a struggle to get back on track. Netflix faces intense competition from streaming rivals, but was also hit after it raised prices and left Russia. Yet some cast doubt on its plans to boost growth, which include bringing in a free ad-supported service. It also plans to crack down on password sharing, estimating that more than 100 million non-paying households watch the service this way. In a sign of the unease, one of America's best known investors, William Ackman, ditched his $1.1bn investment in Netflix on Wednesday, taking a loss of more than $400m. Netflix hints at password sharing crackdown\nAntiques stolen during filming of The Crown His hedge fund Pershing Square Capital Management had bought the shares just three months ago. In a brief statement, Mr Ackman said that while Netflix's plans to change its business model made sense, investing in the company felt too risky. \"While Netflix's business is fundamentally simple to understand, in light of recent events, we have lost confidence in our ability to predict the company's future prospects with a sufficient degree of certainty,\" he wrote. In a trading update on Tuesday, Netflix said its total number of subscribers had fallen by 200,000 in the first three months of 2022, falling well short of its target. It also said some two million more were likely to quit the service in the three months to July. Some analysts warned that, after period of turbo-charged expansion during the pandemic, the streaming giant has run out of easy ways to grow. Squeezed consumers are cutting back on streaming services to save money, while some feel there is too much content to choose from amid an avalanche of competition from rivals such as Disney and Amazon. \"Netflix's wider problem, along with the rest of the sector is that consumers don't have unlimited funds, and that one or two subscriptions is usually enough,\" said Michael Hewson, an analyst at CMC Markets. \"Once you move above that something has to give in a cost-of-living crisis, and while Netflix is still the market leader, it doesn't have the deeper pockets of Apple, Amazon or Disney, which makes it much more vulnerable to a margin squeeze.\" But Julian Aquilina, senior TV analyst at the media research firm Enders Analysis, said it was wrong to write the firm off. \"The streaming market is maturing and the high expectations people had about Netflix are being reset. \"But I think it will remain the market leader, it has such a commanding position. If people are going to ditch a subscription, Netflix won't be the first one they choose.\" He added that the firm had just put up its prices \"which always leads to a drop in subscribers, but also means it's making more revenue per customer\". Netflix remains the world's leading streaming service with more than 220 million subscribers. It is increasingly producing its own content and shows such as the Crown, Bridgerton and Squid Game have been global hits. The firm had enjoyed uninterrupted quarterly growth in subscribers since October 2011 but on Tuesday it admitted it was losing customers to rivals, while struggling to expand due to password sharing. It also said a decision to raise prices in key markets had cost it 600,000 subscribers in North America alone, while its exit from Russia over Ukraine lost it 700,000. Despite the challenges, revenue grew by $7.8bn (£6bn) in the first three months of the year, up 9.8% compared with the same period last year. That marked a slowdown from earlier quarters, while profits fell more than 6% to roughly $1.6bn. Netflix's shares plunged 35% on Wednesday, and fell a further 3.5% on Thursday. ",

            "content": "Santander is cutting the opening hours of its branches and only allowing pre-booked face-to-face appointments in the late afternoon. From 18 July, branches will shut for general inquiries at 15:00 instead of the current closing time of 16:30. Hundreds will also only have half-day opening on a Saturday. The bank said customers who \"required support\" could book an afternoon slot. It said that the move was a response to fewer people using the branch network. A host of High Street banks have closed branches in recent years, to cut costs as customers have moved on to mobile and online banking. More than 4,000 branches have closed since the start of 2015, and hundreds more are scheduled to close. Santander said that its reduced opening hours would ensure that none of its 450 branches would close. Apart from a handful of shopping centre-based branches, the new weekday opening hours across the network will be 09:30 to 15:00. Staff will be in branches for pre-booked face-to-face appointments between 15:00 and 17:00 if customers need support that cannot be provided online, on the phone, or earlier in the day. Nearly 90% of branches would be open from 09:30 to 12:30 on a Saturday. Branch staff would be trained to deal with customers on the phone alongside their face-to-face roles, the bank said. Rival banks join forces to protect future of cash Richard Owen, head of branches at Santander, said: \"These changes will enable us to maintain our existing branch network while providing significant additional capacity to help customers who want to talk to us by phone. \"We want to make sure we have the right mix of channels to help our customers however they choose to bank with us.\" He said the number of customers using its branches had fallen by 33% over the two years before the coronavirus pandemic, and a further 50% in 2020, and 12% in 2021. Customers who visited branches regularly would be notified of the changes by post, the bank said. Jenny Ross, money editor at the consumer association Which?, said: \"Santander deserves credit for taking greater account of customer needs than some of its rivals that have slashed their branch networks without putting in place reasonable alternatives. But this continues a concerning overall trend of banks chipping away at face-to-face services and opening hours. \"While proposals from individual banks and the industry to protect cash are welcome, a piecemeal approach is unlikely to be enough to safeguard access to cash for the millions of people who rely on it.\" ",

            "content": "Swiss food giant Nestle has warned that it will continue to raise the prices of its products because of the rising costs of food. The maker of KitKats and Nesquik cereal increased prices by more than 5% in the first three months of the year. The price rise helped Nestle to report sales growth of 7.6% in the period. As costs rise, Nestle boss Mark Schneider said \"further pricing and mitigating actions over the course of the year\" will be required. \"We stepped up pricing in a responsible manner and saw sustained consumer demand,\" Mr Schneider added. Food prices worldwide are at their highest since records began 60 years ago, according to the UN Food price index. KitKat and Durex makers warn of price rises\nPrices rising at their fastest rate for 30 years In the UK, the cost of living is rising at its fastest pace for 30 years as energy, fuel and food prices continue to soar and increase the squeeze on household budgets. Analysts said Nestle's price rise of 5.2% helped its sales to increase by more than expected. \"Hiking prices to keep things moving in the right direction in the wake of input cost inflation certainly won't be a course of action management want to have to take,\" said Matt Britzman, an analyst at Hargreaves Lansdown. \"But nonetheless, it's the position Nestle finds itself in and doesn't look likely to go away anytime soon,\" he added. Last month, Nestle said it would only sell essentials such as baby formula and medical nutrition products in Russia. It suspended sales of brands such as KitKat and Nesquik and stopped investment in the country as a growing number of Western brands halted operations in Russia in protest at the war. ",

The European Union Chamber of Commerce says that it expects the problems to last for several more weeks. On Friday, Chinese officials said they will help more than 600 firms restart operations in the major financial hub. It comes after UK and US business bodies also said their members have been hit by Covid measures in China. Although some firms have restarted operations in Shanghai by having their employees remain on-site, \"many companies still face the challenges of labour shortages and logistical difficulties,\" said Bettina Schoen-Behanzin, vice president of the European Union Chamber of Commerce in China and head of its Shanghai chapter. \"We estimate that less than 30% of their workforce are eligible to go to work due to the ongoing lockdowns, so there's a huge gap between policy and the reality of implementation,\" she added in a statement on Thursday. \"The consensus is that this logistical nightmare will continue till mid-May,\" Ms Schoen-Behanzin said. Whole communities forced to move in Shanghai's war on Covid\nChina spending and employment hit amid lockdowns Other business groups representing companies from the UK and US have raised concerns about the impact of lockdowns in Shanghai and other Chinese cities. Also on Thursday, the American Chamber of Commerce in Shanghai said officials were still coordinating the movement of workers and goods across Chinese provinces. \"How fast that coordination occurs will help determine how quickly transportation and logistics bottlenecks are unplugged,\" Eric Zheng, the association's president, told the BBC. \"But there are backlogs that may take several days to a few weeks to resolve\". Meanwhile, UK firms in China expect their profits to fall this year because of local Covid restrictions, a survey by the British Chamber of Commerce in China showed on Wednesday. More than two-thirds of the more than 200 companies surveyed said that they expected lower revenues this year. Close to half of them said the restrictions had affected their ability to attract and retain foreign talent. The financial, manufacturing and shipping hub of Shanghai saw a surge in Covid infections earlier this year. It was locked down by authorities for mass testing in late March. As restrictions have been eased, Tesla has recently restarted production at its 'giga factory' in the city. \"We did lose a lot of important days of production,\" its chief executive Elon Musk said on Wednesday. However, the Shanghai factories of German carmaker Volkswagen (VW) and Apple iPhone producer Pegatron remain closed. VW said it was evaluating the \"feasibility\" of resuming operations in Shanghai. Meanwhile, Pegatron told the BBC on Wednesday that it was \"waiting for further instruction from [the] local government\". ",

            "content": "A Russian tycoon has lambasted the country's \"massacre\" in Ukraine and called for an end to the \"crazy war\". Oleg Tinkov wrote in a profanity-littered Instagram post that he did not see \"any beneficiary\" of the conflict. Mr Tinkov is one of Russia's most well-known entrepreneurs and founded the global online bank Tinkoff Bank and owned the cycling team Tinkoff-Saxo. He is also one of the most high profile Russians to publicly condemn President Vladimir Putin's actions. Two of the country's most prominent oligarchs Mikhail Fridman and Oleg Deripaska have made separate calls for peace, but have stopped short of direct criticism. Mr Fridman, a billionaire banker, has said any personal remarks could be a risk not just to himself but also staff and colleagues. However, the businessman Boris Mints, who worked for the Russian government in the 1990s but was discharged of his political roles four days after Mr Putin took office, has joined Mr Tinkov in voicing direct criticism of the president. Mr Mints, who lives in the UK, is the subject of current legal action by the Kremlin. He told the BBC \"every right-thinking person has a duty to speak out against this appalling war and Vladimir Putin's growing authoritarianism\". \"All of us must do what we can to support Ukrainians suffering from this vicious onslaught, whether in Ukraine or as refugees beyond its borders,\" he added. Who are the mega-rich Russians facing sanctions? The UK government has sanctioned Mr Tinkov along with many other Russians identified as having close links to the Kremlim. Mr Mints has not been sanctioned. Warning: This story contains language some may find offensive. Mr Tinkov has previously denied having any close relationship with President Putin or the Kremlin. In his Instagram post, Mr Tinkov said 90% of Russians were against the war in Ukraine and added \"morons in any country are 10%\". \"I don't see a SINGLE beneficiary of this insane war! Innocent people and soldiers are dying,\" Mr Tinkov added. \"Waking up with a hangover, the generals realised that they have a shit army. \"And how will the army be good, if everything else in the country is shitty and mired in nepotism, sycophancy and servility?\" Before Russia invaded Ukraine in late February, Mr Tinkov's wealth had been estimated at more than $4.4bn (£3.4bn). But he has since lost his billionaire status as shares in his bank have plummeted, Forbes reported last month. Switching to English in his post, Mr Tinkov wrote: \"Dear 'collective West' please give Mr Putin a clear exit to save his face and stop this massacre. Please be more rational and humanitarian.\" In a statement, Tinkoff Bank said it would not comment on the \"private opinion\" of its founder, who stepped down as chairman in 2020, saying he no longer made decisions for the brand started in 2006. Mr Tinkov, who is not currently in Russia, owns about 35% of Cyprus-based TCS Group Holding, whose stable of companies under the Tinkoff brand span sectors from banking and insurance to mobile services. He has been described as a \"serial entrepreneur\" whose career has seen him go from bike racing, to importing electronics, flogging frozen food, brewing beer, issuing credit cards and then back to bike racing as owner of cycling's Tinkoff-Saxo team.

            "content": "Shop sales in Scotland have returned to pre-pandemic levels, according to Scottish Retail Consortium (SRC) figures.\nThe SRC says part of the upturn is due to rising prices rather than sales volumes.\nInflation and long term changes to the retail environment continue to present huge challenges The return to pre-pandemic level of sales isn't much of an achievement if it is caused by price inflation. And after a severe battering in recent years, the cost-of-living crisis confronts retailers with new challenges. This was the sector that wasn't just hit hard by Covid, but was already struggling due to structural change. So it was never likely to be a full recovery, but an acceleration of existing trends and new business shapes emerging. The growth in grocery home delivery was slowing up until pandemic hit. Lockdown then forced a rapid shift to consumer habits that have continued to be dynamic between shop visits, use of convenience stores and big weekly shops. The decline in conventional shopping, particularly on high streets, raises questions much bigger than sales figures, prompting retailers to set out how they can make shopping a more appealing prospect. As we heard earlier this month in a refresh of their approach to town centres by the Scottish government and Cosla local council body, recovery for shopping brings many more factors into play than consumer choice and spending levels. Their response stated that town centres are \"the beating heart of our communities and country. Towns are full of emotional and personal connections that go way beyond the physical environment. They form part of our personal, community and national identity and deliver outcomes at the social, environmental as well as the economic level\". Even as retail recovers, the move to online sales continues. It, too, can be a dynamic and challenging environment to do business. Those who do well in it require to invest and keep ahead in software and security, in customer experience online, in deploying data to understand customers better, and in fulfilment, meaning ever-rising expectations of how fast goods can be delivered. That's delivering tens of thousands of new jobs - not in conventional shop sales but in new roles, of software design and engineering, of online entrepreneurs and of lower-wage warehouse and delivery roles. Shopify, a Canadian-based software platform on which many of the smaller retailers sit, claims to be behind the creation of nearly as many jobs in 2020 as were lost that year. A third factor to this dynamic, price-inflating business environment is the pressure that retailers are putting on their suppliers, and nowhere more than in food supplies to the big supermarket chains. Egg producers are one example, warning that current prices being paid will render them non-viable. A large share have told their trade body they will give up if they can't cover the 50% recent growth in hen food costs, 40% rise in energy bills, 30% more for fuel, while labour and packaging costs have also been on the rise. How those supplier relationships play out through the current cost-of-living crisis will contribute to the shape of the retail sector that emerges from it. ",

            "content": "People are set to be better protected from fake reviews and \"subscription traps\" under plans to tackle rip-offs. Proposals include making it \"clearly illegal\" to pay someone to write or host fake reviews. A competition watchdog will get new powers to fine firms up to 10% of their global turnover for bad business practices. But an industry group said the new rules shouldn't put \"any further unnecessary burdens on businesses\". 'Why I write fake online reviews'\nUK firms caught buying five-star Google reviews The average UK household spends about £900 each year after being influenced by online reviews and spends £60 on \"unwanted subscriptions\", the government said. Under the proposed rules, there will be a new laws against offering to write and commissioning fake reviews. Websites hosting consumer reviews will have to take reasonable steps to check they are genuine. Reviews website Trustpilot said it \"welcomes legislation introduced with the aim of protecting consumers from fake reviews\". It said it is \"continually working to ensure we are taking appropriate action against attempts to manipulate reviews on our site\". Tripadvisor, a travel reviews website, said its operations \"are geared towards identifying, blocking and removing fake reviews\". \"The most direct way to protect consumers from biased and inaccurate information is to focus public policies and enforcement on the bad actors,\" said Becky Foley, senior safety director at Tripadvisor. The government also wants to bring in new rules against \"subscription traps\", in which businesses make it difficult to leave a contract. Businesses will have to give clearer information to consumers before they sign up to a subscription contract. They will need to send a reminder that a free trial or low-cost introductory offer is coming to an end, and ensure customers can leave a contract in a \"straightforward, cost-effective and timely way\", the government said. Small business minister Paul Scully said the consumers deserved better and the majority of business doing the \"right thing\" deserved \"protection from rogue traders undermining them\". \"No longer will you visit a five star-reviewed restaurant only to find a burnt lasagne or get caught in a subscription in which there's no end in sight,\" he said. If the government proposals are made into law, prepayment schemes such as Christmas savings clubs will also have to safeguard fully customers' money through insurance or trust accounts. Shoppers' savings clubs - where consumers pay for goods and services in instalments throughout the year - are not currently covered by the Financial Services Compensation Scheme. Under the proposals, even if the company goes bust, shoppers' money will still be protected. The rules aim to prevent issues such as the collapse of Christmas savings club Farepak, which saw tens of thousands of people lose money when the company went bust in 2006. The Competition and Markets Authority (CMA) will be able to award compensation to consumers and directly impose financial penalties worth up to 10% of global annual turnover for businesses that transgress the new rules, or up to £300,000 in the case of an individual. The government said CMA's new powers will mean cases will no longer need to go through the courts. Instead, the CMA will be able to award compensation to consumers and directly impose financial penalties. Rocio Concha, Which? director of policy and advocacy, said the impact of fake reviews was \"enormous\". She said the process to \"hold businesses to account\" was \"far too complicated and lengthy\". \"Britain's consumer and competition laws are in desperate need of an upgrade,\" Ms Concha added. Kate Nicholls, chief executive of UK Hospitality, said the extra powers the CMA stands to gain would \"help stamp out the practice of fake reviews, which do irreparable damage to businesses\". However, she said the \"devil will be in the detail\" of the policy. UK Hospitality wants to see that the \"consumers are safeguarded without placing any further unnecessary burdens on businesses\". She said the new CMA powers should not \"unfairly punish businesses\" especially small businesses, adding that there needed to be \"a clear right of appeal\". \"Fairness for both businesses and consumers, particularly when it comes to offering refunds, will be crucial and any new measures must also be made in the context of a sector facing an onslaught of challenges after a difficult two years,\" she added. The government also said the CMA's powers will allow it to \"have stronger tools to tackle companies colluding to bump-up prices\" and to also stop \"killer acquisitions\" in which big businesses snap up rivals before they can launch new products or services. CMA chief executive Andrea Coscelli said the new rules were an \"important milestone towards strengthening the CMA's ability to hold companies to account, promote fair and open markets, and protect UK consumers\".

            "content": "The chief executive of Scottish Power has said energy price rises later this year are going to be \"horrific\". Keith Anderson told MPs at Westminster \"so many people are really going to struggle\". He said the 54% increase in the energy price cap was already affecting customers and another steep rise is expected in October. Mr Anderson said his company had 8,000 calls last week to a hotline for people worried about their ability to pay. The Scottish Power chief appeared before the House of Commons Business, Energy and Industrial Strategy Committee alongside the bosses of E.ON, EDF and Centrica, which owns British Gas. Mr Anderson said it was too soon for people to have run up large debts as a result of the April price rise but there was a \"massive anxiety\" about what they were going to do to cope with the soaring costs of gas and electricity. He said a lot of people were facing the issue for the first time. How high could my energy bills go? From 1 April, about 18 million households on standard tariffs saw an average increase in gas and electricity prices of £693 - from £1,277 to £1,971 per year. Some 4.5 million prepayment customers could see an even higher increase. Customers on fixed rates are likely to see a significant increase when their deal ends. Mr Anderson said: \"My biggest concern is when we get to October, particularly among the most vulnerable and the poorest. \"In summer consumption goes down. Come October that's going to get horrific, truly horrific.\" Mr Anderson said the size and scale of the problem was beyond anything he could deal with or indeed his industry. He called for a significant shift in government policy and approach. The Scottish Power boss said the government should set up a \"deficit fund\" and wipe £1,000 off the bill of anyone who is deemed to be in fuel poverty and on pre-payment meters, which would be repaid over 10 years by all customers or the government. Mr Anderson said such a policy was required for people in fuel poverty that \"puts their bill back to where it used to be before the gas crisis\". He called that \"stage one\", which should be followed up with a social tariff that gives poorer households discounted energy. This should replace the current price cap, he said. Mr Anderson added it is \"perverse\" that customers with prepayment meters - who are likely to be more vulnerable - pay more for their energy than those who pay by direct debit. Meanwhile, the Scottish Parliament's net zero, energy and transport committee heard that the high costs would continue for some time yet. Dr Richard Lowes, senior associate at The Regulatory Assistance Project, said people \"haven't started feeling the pinch yet\", adding there is unlikely to be any \"let up\" before 2023. Dr Matthew Hannon, from Strathclyde University's Hunter Centre for Entrepreneurship, warned that the energy price cap could rise again in October - with the average electricity and gas bill paid by direct debit forecast to go from \"just shy of £2,000 to roughly £2,600\". He told the committee that people in the UK should \"brace themselves for record energy prices\". Dr Hannon added: \"There's probably two key factors which I expect will start to set the scene for whether we see bills starting to drop. \"That's the extent to how quickly we start to decouple our energy consumption from gas - that's both for power generation and also for heat - and I think associated with that is some of the difficulties with decoupling wholesale electricity prices from gas more broadly. \"So even if we aren't consuming much gas, the price of gas will dictate, to a large extent, the price of electricity. \"I think the other key factor here is the extent to which we can drive forward on energy efficiency.\" ",

At a meeting, the IMF \"commended on the steps already taken by [Mr Sabry] to mitigate the financial situation in Sri Lanka,\" the country's finance ministry said in a statement. \"[The] Minister of Finance has made a request for a Rapid Financing Instrument (RFI) with the IMF. IMF has subsequently informed Minister Sabry that India had also made representations on behalf of Sri Lanka for an RFI,\" it added. \"It had been communicated that IMF will consider the special request made despite it being outside of the standard circumstances for the issuance of an RFI.\" A RFI is usually granted to an IMF member nation with \"urgent\" funding needs, because of sharp commodity price rises, natural disasters or conflicts. It does not require the country to have a plan to restructure its economy. Sri Lanka warns it will default on foreign debt\nFirms struggle amid Sri Lanka's economic crisis Last week, the Sri Lankan government said it would temporarily default on $35.5bn (£27.3bn) in foreign debt as the pandemic and the war in Ukraine made it \"impossible\" to make payments to overseas creditors. On Monday, Sri Lanka's finance ministry confirmed that it would miss $78m in interest rate payments on international sovereign bonds. A spokesperson told the BBC this was \"in line with the government policy decision\" to pause foreign payouts. If the overdue interest rate payments are not made within a 30-day grace period, it would mark Sri Lanka's first default on its foreign debt since its independence from the UK in 1948. Asked if payment would be made within the grace period, the spokesperson said: \"A decision in this regard will be published in due course\". The country has seen mass protests in recent weeks as it suffers food shortages, soaring fuel prices and major power cuts as its reserves of foreign currencies are running low. The latest rating from Moody's suggests that overseas bonds issued by Sri Lanka are \"likely in, or very near default\". The rating agency said the country's move to stop some payments \"will lead to a series of defaults with the first coupon payments for the government's international bonds coming due today, April 18, 2022.\" A coupon is the interest payment due on a bond. Moody's added that the non-payment was \"unlikely to be cured during the grace period\", as a debt restructuring programme with the IMF \"will take time\". Last week, two other major credit rating agencies also warned that Sri Lanka was on the brink of defaulting on its debts. Credit ratings are intended to help investors understand the level of risk they face when buying a financial instrument, in this case a country's debt - or sovereign bond. International sovereign bonds make up the largest share of Sri Lanka's foreign debt. They are held by countries including China, Japan and India as well as major investment firms such as BlackRock, UBS and Allianz. Meanwhile, the Colombo Stock Exchange is scheduled to remain closed all this week, due to the \"present situation in the country\". ",

            "content": "China's consumer spending fell and unemployment rose last month as Covid lockdowns confined millions of people to their homes, official figures show. Joblessness reached the highest level since the early part of the pandemic. However, overall the country's economy grew at a faster pace than expected in the first three months of this year. A surge in infections has triggered lockdowns in several major cities - including the financial, manufacturing and shipping hub of Shanghai. Retail sales fell by 3.5% in March compared to a year earlier, China's National Bureau of Statistics said. That was the first decline since July 2020. For the same period unemployment rose to 5.8%, the highest level since May 2020. The figures highlight the increased risk of a sharp slowdown in the coming months as major lockdowns and the war in Ukraine take their toll on the world's second largest economy. As a whole, China's economy grew at a better-than-expected rate in the first three months of the year. Gross domestic product (GDP), a key economic indicator, expanded by 4.8% compared to a year earlier, beating analysts' forecasts. However, that is below Beijing's goal of growing its economy by 5.5% this year. China reports first Covid deaths in Shanghai\nClashes in Shanghai over Covid lockdown evictions Tommy Xie, head of Greater China research at OCBC Bank, said that the lockdowns, which began in the second half of March, were so far having a \"limited\" impact but he expects the restrictions to be a significant drag on economic growth this month. \"[China] is likely to feel the full-blown impact from the lockdown,\" Mr Xie told the BBC. \"The impact in April is likely to deepen given the longer-than-expected lockdowns in Shanghai and spillover to other parts of China.\" On Friday, China's Ministry of Industry and Information Technology said it would help more than 600 companies in Shanghai to restart operations. They included firms in the computer chip, car making and medical industries. The regulator said it has sent a team to the city \"to ensure the supply of medical supplies and promote key industries\". Manufacturers, including Pegatron a major producer of Apple's iPhone, have halted operations in Shanghai because of the lockdown. Richard Yu, an executive at Chinese technology giant Huawei, last week warned that technology, industrial and automobile supply chains \"will come to a complete halt\" if the city did not resume production by next month. \"That will pose severe consequences and massive losses for the whole industry,\" Mr Yu said in a WeChat post on Friday. Earlier on Monday, Chinese authorities reported the deaths of three people from Covid in Shanghai, which was locked down in late March. The three people were aged between 89 and 91, had several underlying illnesses, and were unvaccinated, authorities said. Meanwhile, the strict lockdown of the Shanghai has stoked anger among some of the city's residents. In recent weeks people have taken to social media to complain about the restrictions and the lack of food supplies, while video footage has shown confrontations between police and residents. ",

            "header": "Climate change: 'We're making wine in Norway'",
            "content": "Norwegian winemaker Bjørn Bergum talks to his grapevines. \"You have to have a connection with them. When I woke up this morning, there was 3cm of snow. I was saying to them: 'Don't be afraid - it will be nice in the afternoon.'\" Perhaps Bjørn's plants do need a little extra encouragement; they're growing at 61 degrees north of the equator - far outside the 30-50 degrees latitude traditionally considered optimum for wine production. But climate change is pushing vineyards further north and south towards the poles. The trends are absolutely clear, according to Dr Greg Jones, a climatologist who specialises in grape production and wines and is himself the owner of a winery, Abacela, in Oregon in the US. \"A lot of our cool climate limits have changed. They've gone further north in the northern hemisphere, and further south in the southern hemisphere. Slinde Vineyard, which Bjorn runs with his partner Halldis, is at the furthest reaches of these new limits. Positioned by the Sognefjord, Norway's longest and deepest fjord, the vines grow on slopes which catch the sun while facing snow-capped mountains. Bjørn remembers the fjord freezing over in winter during his childhood, but he says that never happens now. He's noticed other changes in the weather over the years. \"I can see when it's raining, it's raining more, but when it's warm, it's warmer too.\" While he worries about the state of the planet and in own country, he acknowledges that, as a wine producer, climate change is working in his favour. A really simple guide to climate change\nCOP26 promises will hold warming under 2C That said, it is still a challenge to produce wine this far north. Bjørn says it takes a particular kind of hard work and dedication. \"I do everything for my 2,700 babies. I'll stay up in the night if I need to, to help them to survive if a frost is coming.\" He works with a variety of grapes to create blends that have tropical notes and a minerality that he says comes from the clay soil. A secret ingredient is the special quality of the light this far north. \"We have got a lot of light here. That's our advantage. And we have chilly nights. And we have also got the sun from the reflections from the fjord into the steep hillside. \"So the grapes, the leaves, take up a lot of aromas and absorb them into the skin and we take them out again, to make nice wines.\" But it's not easy convincing everyone that Norwegian wine is worth sampling, Bjørn says. \"We have got some people telling us: 'Don't tell anyone, but I have never tasted a wine like this. It's really good - maybe the best I've ever tasted.' \"But they don't dare to tell it when they go back to Germany or other countries because I think they want to mingle with the society within wines, and then it's not very good to tell they've tasted a really good Norwegian wine.\" Wine drinkers could face higher prices, firm warns\nHuge ancient winery discovered in Israel Having won gold medals in Norwegian wine competitions Bjørn is keen to try for some international medals, but says he suspects he'll only stand a chance if the judging is blind. \"If they knew the wine came from Norway, they would probably not taste it at all. But when it's blind tasting they have to taste it and you will get what you deserve, I think.\" Bjørn and Halldis plan to go commercial this year. It's early days and they still have a lot to prove, but Bjørn believes they're forging a whole new wine-making frontier in Norway - with five growers existing within a 20km radius. \"We have now established a winegrowing team here in Sognefjord. It's only 20,000 vines, but it's starting up and I think within five or 10 years, we will probably have a little wine district.\" But while climate change may be providing an opportunity for producers in previously unchartered territory, it's providing a serious challenge for those in many of the world's more established wine-making regions. \"I did an analysis of 25 of the top places in the world, growing grapes, looking at their long term historical temperature data,\" says Dr Jones \"And every single place warmed during their growing season. And during the winters, there were no places that were not warming, there were no places that were cooling.\" In Bordeaux, this changing climate is palpable, according to the owner of Chateau George 7 in Fronsac, Sally Evans. \"We've had three spring frosty periods in the last five years since I've been here. And before that, probably they hadn't had one for 20 or 30 years. So these extreme climatic events seem to be more and more common. And that is what is difficult.\" She says global rising temperatures can also be tasted in a glass of wine. \"When you've got warmer temperatures, the fruit ripens and there's a lot more sugar in the grapes, which gives you higher alcohol when you ferment. The alcohol in wine probably has increased by about two degrees over the last 30 years. \"The sun and the warmth also impacts the acidity of the wine. You need the acidity for the freshness and the overall balance.\" Hot, dry summers can also impair the flavour of the fruit, she says. The Bordeaux wine region has introduced new grape varieties which are more suited to these conditions, but Sally says they will take a generation to grow and mature. In the meantime, she says winemakers are adapting - pruning late to avoid Spring frosts and managing the leaf canopy to shade grapes from the hot sun. And she says consumers and producers alike will have to accept that some established wines will have a different character in the future. \"What is typical in 30 years may not be worse, in terms of quality - it may even be better - but it may not be the same profile as a wine now.\" Climate change means producers need to adapt to survive, she says. \"I think we'll be seeing in the next five or 10 years, just how that is impacting people and their livelihoods here in Bordeaux. Listen to the latest edition of The Food Chain for more on the impact of climate change on wine producers. ",

            "header": "What's the problem with calories on restaurant menus?",
            "content": "Going out for a meal is meant to be an enjoyable experience, something you do as a treat or for a special occasion. But with calories on menus now compulsory in England, the joy is being taken away for some people with eating disorders. Isabella, who has recovered from an eating disorder, went to her favourite bakery a few days ago and says seeing calories listed \"made me feel like I didn't want to go back\". Restaurants and cafes employing more than 250 people are now required by law to show calorie information, with a similar system being considered for Scotland. The government says it has been brought in to tackle obesity by helping people to make healthier choices. Some groups have been really pleased with the change, with diabetes campaigners calling it an important step in preventing people from developing type 2, which is diet-related. But Isabella says going out for meals was an important step in helping her recover from anorexia, and this change could cause setbacks. \"When I was in a recovery unit, as part of the programme to get back to sort of a normal life, you had to go out for restaurant meals,\" she says. \"It was a way to gauge how you'd cope in the real world away from the support of staff, and for me it was a really big moment to be with my family.\" She says that if calories had been listed, her natural response would have been to choose the lowest calorie option on the menu rather than what looked most appealing, which goes against what is taught on recovery programmes. Prof Sandeep Ranote, a consultant paediatric psychiatrist specialising in eating disorders, says \"part of recovery planning is about reintroducing social activities, being able to go on holiday and visit restaurants\". She says: \"Some of what we know from those with lived experience [of eating disorders] is that seeing calories printed on menus could be a huge trigger to their anxiety.\" It's difficult to predict how many people in the UK have an eating disorder, but estimates are between 1.25 and 3.4 million. Pandemic and eating disorders – the impact\nMaking sure you get the right type of calorie Prof Ranote adds that calories on menus can be incredibly triggering for people with both anorexia and bulimia, who may search for lower calorie foods, but on the flipside could lead to people with binge eating disorder finding higher calorie items \"to trigger guilt and shame\". She says calorie counting is a symptom seen in many of those suffering from eating disorders, and putting calories on menus could affect the work done by mental health services. \"It could hinder some of the work we do in the prevention of eating disorders, because the focus becomes about numbers. Calories don't teach good nutrition or what's a good balanced diet, or a healthy relationship with food.\" It is a mental health condition where you use control of food to cope with feelings and other situations\nUnhealthy eating behaviours may include eating too much or too little and worrying about your weight\nThe three most common types are anorexia nervosa, bulimia and binge eating disorder\nAnorexia nervosa is trying to control your weight by not eating enough food, exercising too much or doing both\nBulimia is losing control over how much you eat and taking drastic action to not put on weight\nBinge eating disorder is eating large portions of food until you feel uncomfortably full Source: NHS The average age at which someone develops an eating disorder is between 16 and 19, according to eating disorder charity Beat, and Isabella is concerned by what could happen if young people are presented with calorie information when they go for meals. \"I think for children to be introduced to menus with calories on, it could really affect their mental health,\" she says. \"At that age, you might be starting to go out with your friends for meals after school and it could really create negative associations with food,\" Isabella adds. A Beat spokesperson said: \"We know from the people we support that including calories on menus can contribute to harmful thoughts and behaviours worsening. \"It can create a fixation on restricting calories for those with anorexia or bulimia, or increase feelings of guilt for those with binge eating disorder.\" A possible solution that has been discussed on social media is restaurants offering two menus - one with calories and one without, but currently this is not required under legislation.  The Department for Health and Social Care responded to this proposed solution by saying: \"The regulations allow businesses to provide menus without calorie information at the request of the customer.\" And it added it would \"continue to evaluate the impact of out of home calorie labelling across the population, including on people with an eating disorder\". The BBC asked UK Hospitality for comment on how its businesses feel about offering menus without calories. However, Isabella says she's not sure two menus are really the answer. \"Is it going to stop people with eating disorders from asking for the menu with calories on? Probably not because I think there's a horrible part of your mind that says you've got to know, so you choose the lowest calorie option.\" Information and support for those affected by eating disorders or mental health issues is available via the BBC's Action Line.

            "content": "The energy regulator has said it has seen \"troubling signs\" that suppliers may have been increasing direct debit payments by \"more than is necessary\". Ofgem said it was concerned that firms may be directing customers to energy deals that aren't in their \"best interest\". It comes as households face significant increases in their energy bills. On 1 April, yearly bills increased by an average of £693 for about 18 million households on standard tariffs. And some 4.5 million prepayment customers saw an average increase of £708 - from £1,309 to £2,017. Energy experts have encouraged customers to take and submit meter readings as the changes take effect, in an attempt to save cash. Jonathan Brearley, chief executive of Ofgem, said the regulator had received information from consumer groups and the public about \"bad practices\" by some suppliers. \"We are also seeing troubling signs that some companies are reacting to these changes by allowing levels of customer service to deteriorate,\" he wrote in a blog post on Ofgem's website. He added that they were also concerned about \"the way some vulnerable customers are being treated when they fall into difficulties\". Mr Brearly said Ofgem planned a series of reviews and \"stricter supervision\" of energy firms over its concerns that the suppliers may have been increasing direct debit payments by \"more than is necessary\", or directing customers to tariffs that \"may not be in their best interest\". The regulator said it would issue \"substantial fines\" to firms found failing to comply with the measures. Energy bills have increased because the energy price cap - the maximum price suppliers in England, Wales and Scotland can charge households - is being raised. Energy firms have been able to increase bills by 54% following the introduction of the new cap on 1 April. Bill shock for millions as energy price rise hits\nMoney tips: How to cut spending as energy bills rise The price cap is reviewed every six months, and prices are expected to rise yet again in October. A report by the bank Investec has warned bills could reach £3,000 a year. Experts encouraged people without smart meters to submit gas and electricity meter readings on 31 March to ensure that they had logged the use of less expensive rates for energy before the changes took place on 1 April. If you can't submit your readings, you should take a photo with the meter reading and meter serial number both clearly visible to submit at a later date. It's worth noting too that logging an extra reading to give a more accurate picture of your energy usage could see your bills go up if it is more than your company had forecast. People struggling to afford energy bills can seek advice from charities such as Citizens Advice, Turn2Us or the StepChange debt charity. All the big energy firms also have hardship funds that can offer assistance if someone is struggling to pay. The government has said it will offer extra help worth a total of £350 via the council tax system in England too. The warm house discount scheme will also be expanded to cover three million households. It offers low income households a one-off annual discount on their electricity bill, and was worth £140 in 2021-22. In October customers in England, Scotland and Wales will receive a £200 rebate on their energy bills. They will have to repay this at £40 a year for five years, starting in April 2023. The Northern Ireland energy market is separate, but the government has said £150m would be available to support households. ",

            "content": "Tesla boss Elon Musk has admitted he is \"not sure\" his takeover bid for social media firm Twitter will be successful. He made the comments at a conference just hours after revealing that he had offered to buy the company for $54.20 a share, valuing the firm at $43bn. Also on Thursday, Twitter's chief executive told employees that the company was evaluating the approach. Parag Agrawal reportedly said at the staff meeting that the company was not being \"held hostage\" by the offer. Speaking at the TED2022 conference in Vancouver, Mr Musk said: \"I am not sure that I will actually be able to acquire it.\" He added that he had a \"Plan B\" if his bid for Twitter was rejected, but gave no further details of what that could mean. Mr Musk also said at the event that Twitter should be more open and transparent. \"I think it's very important for there to be an inclusive arena for free speech,\" he said. Elon Musk makes offer to buy Twitter\nNFT of Jack Dorsey's first tweet struggles to sell On Thursday, he revealed his offer to buy all the shares in Twitter that he does not already own. In an official filing to US regulators, Mr Musk said he was the right person to \"unlock\" the company's \"extraordinary potential\" and that if his offer was not accepted, \"I would need to reconsider my position as a shareholder.\" He also said that if Twitter's board of directors chose to reject the offer, it would be \"utterly indefensible not to put this offer to a shareholder vote\". Saudi Arabia's Prince Alwaleed bin Talal shunned the bid, tweeting: \"I don't believe that the proposed offer by Elon Musk comes close to the intrinsic value of Twitter given its growth prospects.\" The billionaire claimed that he has a stake in Twitter through his investment firm Kingdom Holding Company. However, Mr Musk immediately replied asking how many Twitter shares Prince Alwaleed's firm owns, adding: \"What are the Kingdom's views on journalist freedom of speech?\" The BBC is not responsible for the content of external sites.\nView original tweet on Twitter Twitter confirmed that it had received the bid, but said its board must still review the \"unsolicited, non-binding\" offer, which values its shares at well below the level of more than $70 that they reached last summer. Mr Musk already owns more than 9% of the social media platform, but he is no longer its biggest shareholder. Asset management firm Vanguard Group disclosed on 8 April that its funds now own a 10.3% stake, bumping him off the top spot. Mr Musk is the world's richest man, according to Forbes magazine, mostly due to his shareholding in electric vehicle maker Tesla where he is chief executive. He has not revealed any details on how his bid for Twitter will be financed. Mr Musk is being advised by US investment bank Morgan Stanley. Bruce Daisley, Twitter's former vice president for Europe, Middle East and Africa, told the BBC's Today programme that Mr Musk appeared to be \"toying with the company to some extent\". \"The latest bid he's put in, as far as I can tell, doesn't seem to be regarded as a serious bid but it is proving to be very disruptive with the organisation I think.\" He said that Twitter may benefit from being taken private and out of the hands of shareholders. \"To some extent the constant scrutiny of being a publicly listed company, following in the footsteps of the likes of Google and Facebook, is definitely a challenge for the organisation so private ownership might be the right solution. \"I'm not convinced Elon Musk's approach is going to win many fans though,\" he added. Twitter's shares, which are listed in New York, initially rose on Thursday but ended down 1.6% at $45.08, below Mr Musk's offer. The board of Twitter has enlisted the help of another Wall Street bank, Goldman Sachs, as it considers how to respond to the takeover approach. Other than acknowledging the takeover bid, Twitter has publicly kept pretty quiet since Elon Musk revealed his attempt to buy the company. But details have emerged of an \"all hands\" meeting, where questions were put to the company's chief executive, Parag Agrawal. The details give nothing more than a suggestion of what Twitter's management thinks of the offer. Mr Agrawal reportedly said he could not talk about the details, but that the company was not being \"held hostage\". I'm told the meeting was designed to give employees more information. But one Twitter worker told me they left the meeting more confused. \"I didn't leave feeling any sense of clarity,\" they said. The employee said that they were in the dark about what could happen next. \"I would say I know about as much as the public on Twitter,\" they said. Twitter's board not only has to weigh up the offer, but also assess the damage that Elon Musk could do if scorned. Apparently he has a Plan B if Twitter rejects his offer. Twitter may be worth tens of billions of dollars, but it is nothing compared to Elon Musk, who is worth more than $200bn. And that kind of wealth makes him a dangerous foe. ",

            "content": "The buyer of a non-fungible token (NFT) of Twitter co-founder Jack Dorsey's first tweet says he \"may never sell it\" after receiving a series of low bids. Malaysia-based Sina Estavi has been offered just over $6,200 (£4,720), about 0.2% of the $2.9m he paid for it. Mr Estavi has compared the digital asset to Leonardo da Vinci's Mona Lisa. The tweet, which says \"just setting up my twttr,\" was first posted in March 2006 and was auctioned off last year by Mr Dorsey for charity. Mr Estavi bought the tweet in the form of a NFT in March 2021. NFTs have been touted as the digital answer to collectibles. However, they have no tangible form of their own, and experts have warned about risks in the market. What are NFTs?\nBuyer defends paying $2.9m for 'Mona Lisa' of tweets Last week, Mr Estavi announced that the tweet was up for sale on NFT marketplace OpenSea. He pledged to donate half the proceeds - which he estimated to be $25m or more - to US charity GiveDirectly. The BBC is not responsible for the content of external sites.\nView original tweet on Twitter Mr Estavi, who is the chief executive of blockchain company Bridge Oracle, had earlier claimed that he had been offered $10m for the tweet. However, the highest bid was valued at $6,222.36 on Thursday. Earlier in the day, Mr Estavi told the BBC he \"may never sell\" the tweet unless he received a \"high bid\", without saying what that was. \"Last year, when I paid for this NFT, very few people even heard the name NFT. Now I say this NFT is the Mona Lisa of the digital world. There is only one of that and it will never be the same,\" Mr Estavi said. \"Years later, people will realise the value of this NFT,\" he added. \"Keep that in mind.\" Mr Dorsey's brief tweet was sold to Mr Estavi in an auction on an online platform called Valuables, which is owned by the US-based company Cent. As the buyer, Mr Estavi received a certificate, digitally signed and verified by Mr Dorsey, as well as the metadata of the original tweet. The data includes information such as the time the tweet was posted and its text contents. Although Mr Estavi is searching for a buyer, he said he \"will not accept anyone's offer\". \"I think the value of this NFT is far greater than you can imagine and whoever wants to buy it must be worthy.\" Asked who that may be, Mr Estavi said: \"I think someone like Elon Musk could deserve this NFT\". NFTs that are\"one of a kind assets\" have often been sold for thousands - and even millions - of dollars. ",

            "content": "Sri Lanka is about to default on its debts, two of the world's largest credit rating agencies have warned. Fitch Ratings lowered its assessment of the South Asian nation, saying \"a sovereign default process has begun\". S&P Global Ratings made a similar announcement and said that a default is now a \"virtual certainty\". This week, Sri Lanka said it will temporarily default on its foreign debts as it faces its worst economic crisis in more than 70 years. Meanwhile, faced with mass protests over major power cuts and the soaring cost of food and fuel, officials have urged Sri Lankans working abroad to send money home. The new governor of the country's central bank appealed for donations in sterling, US dollars and euros on Wednesday. He said the money \"will be utilised only for the purpose of importation of essentials such as food, fuel and medicine\". On Monday, Sri Lanka is due to make $78m (£59.4m) of interest payments on its international sovereign bonds. If the payment is not made within a 30-day grace period it would mark the country's first default on its foreign debt since independence from the UK in 1948. Sri Lanka warns it will default on foreign debt Fitch's latest rating puts Sri Lanka at \"near default\" and indicated that its \"payment capacity is irrevocably impaired\". \"We will downgrade the [rating] once a payment on an issuance is missed and the grace period has expired,\" the firm said in a statement on Wednesday. S&P also downgraded Sri Lanka \"to reflect the virtual certainty of a default on some affected obligations\". The ratings agency said it was waiting for more details on Sri Lanka's debt restructuring plan, or confirmation that its government had failed to pay its creditors. \"We expect the government to miss paying these coupons,\" S&P said in a note. A coupon is the interest payment due on a bond. Credit ratings are intended to help investors understand the level of risk they face when buying a financial instrument, in this case a country's debt - or sovereign bond. On Tuesday, the Sri Lankan government said it would temporarily default on $35.5bn in foreign debt. Its finance ministry said the impact of the pandemic and the war in Ukraine made it \"impossible\" to pay its creditors. The country is due to start talks with the International Monetary Fund (IMF) next week on a loan programme to get its economy back on track. It steeply devalued its currency last month ahead of talks with the IMF over a bailout. ",

            "content": "The French beauty brand L'Occitane says it will keep its shops in Russia open despite the invasion of Ukraine. The firm told the BBC it had discussed closing its stores \"at length\" but said it had not because it wanted to protect staff from potential \"retaliation\". It has stopped shipping to Russia but website sales still seem to be open. Hundreds of international brands including L'Oreal and Estee Lauder have already closed shops and ceased online sales in Russia in protest at the war. Some customers criticised L'Occitane for its decision and called for a boycott of the brand which is sold at more than 3,085 retail outlets worldwide and had sales of €1.5bn (£1.3bn) last year. The cosmetics firm, which has spas and stores in Russian cities including Moscow and St Petersburg, said it could not take the \"risk\" of closing its shops. \"At this point we cannot guarantee that our 700 employees in Russia will not face retaliation if we cease to operate in the country,\" a spokeswoman told the BBC. \"We are particularly concerned for those of our employees who have relatives in Ukraine or who are of Ukrainian descent,\" she added. \"At the same time, we are firmly committed to our partners and their employees in Ukraine.\" Growing numbers of firms pull back from Russia\nChanel restricts sales of goods to Russians abroad The firm said it strongly condemned Russia's \"unjustified and unprovoked\" invasion and had significantly scaled back its operations in Russia, suspending its investment plans and all shipments into the country. It refused to comment on whether it had continued online sales in the country and what the impact of stopping shipments would have on its Russian shops. Tweeting a picture of a L'Occitane product one customer said: \"I've used this cream for years, never again. Even if they back out, they've showed their corporate integrity.\" The BBC is not responsible for the content of external sites.\nView original tweet on Twitter L'Occitane is one of a number of firms listed as still operating in Russia by Professor Jeffrey Sonnenfeld at Yale University's School of Management. Among them are the French energy giant EDF, the UAE's Emirates airline, and China's Lenovo computer brand. However, a much larger group of around 600 big firms have pulled out of Russia or suspended sales since it invaded, including Starbucks, Coca Cola, Levi's and Apple. Other international outlets still open in Russia have said they are not able to shut stores due to complex franchise deals preventing them from withdrawing. Burger King and the hotel groups Marriott and Accor are among the firms restricted by these arrangements. On Tuesday, some independent Nike stores were found to be operating in Russia over a week after the sportswear brand said it was temporarily closing all its shops in the country. Professor Vanessa Burbano, from Columbia Business School in the US, said that consistency between claims and actions is important for brands with operations in Russia. \"Customers and employees do pay attention to which companies are first in making these kinds of commitments and which firms don't go as far,\" Prof Burbano said. \"The risk of companies making claims that may not be perceived as consistent with their actions is that they could be seen as a green-washing in the Ukraine context which would be bad for their reputation.\" ",

            "header": "'Flooding meant I could only reach my home by boat'",
            "content": "When the village of Datchet in the Thames Valley was hit by flooding, the only way Susan Young could reach her new home was by boat. She had yet to even move into the lower ground floor flat before it was hit by the rising river waters in 2014. But after the initial despair, she wanted to seize an opportunity. She was not only determined to repair her new home, but also to improve it so it was resilient to any future flooding. \"The village is beautiful so I felt the benefits outweighed the flood risks when I bought it. Clearly, the River Thames had other plans,\" she said. \"But I have never regretted buying it. It took time to get it back into a liveable state, but then I was forced into an opportunity.\" The measures she took back then will now be available to more people through the Build Back Better scheme, which launches in a week's time. It will allow people, through participating insurers, to claim up to £10,000 for flood resilience measures over and above the cost of work to repair damage caused by a flood. The funding comes from the government-backed Flood Re project, which was set up to provide affordable home insurance for people in flood-risk areas, which is itself paid for through a levy on UK insurers. Since the flooding in Datchet in Berkshire in 2014, Mrs Young has spent around £6,000 to £7,000 on flood prevention and resilience in her home, which is about 260m from the bank of the Thames. This has included pumps and a specially designed door, with seals to stop water getting in. A flood guard has been added to the back door, and non-return valves fitted to the drains. She has accepted that the risk cannot be entirely extinguished, so the floors are tiled, and doors and skirting boards are varnished rather than painted. She has bricks to stand heavy furniture on if there is a flood warning, as well as freestanding pumps and sandbag substitutes ready, and even a toilet bung to prevent backflow. \"If you can reduce the damage, then it reduces the time you are out of your home after flooding, which is probably the worst part of it,\" she said. The village has community flood groups and flood plans. Mrs Young, now aged 59, said everyone had to play their part, which was why she welcomed the new initiative. Insurers plan green replacements for write-offs\nMinister hears calls for action in flood-hit town She paid for some of the work, and the survey required, with a grant. However, such local or national government funding can be slow, experts say, prompting the inception of the Build Back Better programme. Andy Bord, chief executive of Flood Re, which will launch the scheme next week, said: \"In the UK, since 1998 we have seen six of the wettest years on record, with 5.2 million homes and businesses at risk of flooding. The trajectory will only continue to worsen without urgent, collective action.\" He said homeowners needed to be encouraged to adapt and insurers needed to innovate to make tangible change in this area. \"To do so, we must throw the traditional principles of insurance to one side. This means thinking of future resilience and building back better after a flood, rather than simply returning a property to how it was before.\" Insurers NFU Mutual, Aviva, Ageas, Lloyds Banking Group and LV= General Insurance have pledged to join the scheme this year or early next year. They can set their own cap on the extra funding, which could be less than £10,000 per claim. They will also decide what work can go ahead, and which measures will be installed. However, insurers would be bound by a code of practice that states all customers should be treated equally and fairly. Malcolm Tarling, from the Association of British Insurers, said the insurance sector was broadly supportive of the scheme, and the trade body was encouraging members to consider joining. \"Insurers have a role to play,\" he said. \"In the end, it is down to individual insurers whether they sign up or not.\" He added that some companies may already offer support to help people install flood resilience measures in their home.

            "header": "Inflation: Five things that are going up in price and why",
            "content": "The cost of living is continuing to climb, with prices in the UK rising at their fastest rate for 30 years, according to the latest official figures. Factors including supply chain issues, the war in Ukraine, recruitment challenges and increased wages have come together to create a perfect storm of higher costs, as the country recovers from the Covid pandemic. Prices are increasing on a wide variety of products - here are five things which have been particularly affected and some of the reasons why. Changes in prices at the pump are largely determined by crude oil prices. Fuel prices were already rising before the war in Ukraine, as suppliers struggled to meet the growing demand post-lockdown. But now the Russian invasion is making matters worse. The country is one of the world's largest oil exporters but Western countries have pledged to move away from Russian oil following the invasion. The US has announced a complete ban on Russian oil imports, while the UK is to phase it out by the end of the year. The EU is also trying to reduce its reliance on Russian oil. That means demand for oil from other producers has increased, leading to higher prices. The UK imports just 6% of its crude oil from Russia, but 18% of its diesel. The average price of diesel in the UK has risen 18% since the start of February, while the average cost of unleaded has risen by 11%. The surge in global demand for energy following the relaxation of Covid restrictions has also pushed up the price of gas. With Russia the world's largest natural gas exporter, the invasion of Ukraine has driven prices even higher. Again, the UK gets relatively little of its gas from Russia but it's still affected by volatile global prices. Energy bills rose further after the energy price cap - the maximum price suppliers in England, Wales and Scotland can charge households - increased by an average £700 a year at the beginning of April. Meanwhile, businesses are also being affected by rising energy prices - and they're not protected by the price cap. Paul White, who owns the pizzeria 6/CUT in Eccles, Greater Manchester, said his business was spending £500 more a week on energy bills, alongside rising fuel and food prices. \"We need to find an extra £1,400 a week to cover the costs of everything that's come on in the last few weeks,\" he told the BBC. He says he will have to put up prices, and is looking to charge each customer about 50p to £1 extra to cover his rising overheads. The rising cost of raw materials, supply chain disruption and shipping costs have all made furniture more expensive. Global shipping companies have been overwhelmed by surging demand after the pandemic so retailers have had to pay more to transport goods. Construction supply firm Timco told the BBC it used to pay about $1,000 (£739) for a shipping container, but was now having to pay \"north of $10,000\". The British Furniture Manufacturers Association, which represents the industry, said the cost of materials including hard woods, fabrics, foam and steel were all rapidly increasing and it warned the situation had \"escalated significantly in recent weeks\". The association added that rising energy, fuel and labour costs were also affecting its members. Some retailers have passed on these increased costs to customers. At the end of last year, furniture giant Ikea said it had increased the average price of products in its UK stores by 10% due to rising supply chain costs. The company also blamed raw material and transportation costs for the increase. The price of oils and fats for food increased by 7.2% in March alone and is nearly a quarter more expensive than a year ago, according to the Office for National Statistics. Between them Ukraine and Russia produce most of the world's sunflower oil and the war has inevitably disrupted exports, leading to increased prices. The biggest cooking oil bottler for UK shops, Edible Oils, has warned its supplies of sunflower oil are already running short. As a result of this, some food manufacturers have turned to alternative ingredients, including rapeseed oil, which is grown by British farmers. The increased demand has meant higher prices for these oils too. Tom Lock, founder of the British Snack Company, which makes hand cooked crisps, said his firm had switched to rapeseed oil to make its products. \"There's an incredible scramble. Everyone's doing the same thing. So while sunflower oil is impossible to get at the moment, rapeseed oil is possible but difficult to get as well obviously because everyone's having the same idea, as prices are skyrocketing at the moment,\" he told the BBC. Fertiliser is another one of Russia's biggest exports and since the invasion of Ukraine prices have soared. This has contributed to increased costs for farmers - and dairy products are among those affected. The UK's largest dairy, Arla Foods, says animal feed, fuel and fertiliser costs have all \"rocketed\" because of the crisis in Ukraine. David Christensen, an Arla dairy farmer based in Oxfordshire, told the BBC his fertiliser bill had jumped from £350 to £900 a tonne and his fuel had more than doubled. Arla has said dairy farmers will need to be paid more for their products to cover their increased costs - and this is feeding through to prices on supermarket shelves. The price of fresh milk rose by 1.7% in March and is 13.2% more expensive than a year ago. ",

            "header": "Soaring petrol costs drive UK inflation to 30-year high",
            "content": "Prices are rising at their fastest rate for 30 years, driven by a sharp increase in petrol and diesel costs. The UK inflation rate rose to 7% in the year to March, the highest rate since 1992 and up from 6.2% in February. Prices are rising faster than wages and there is pressure on the government to do more to help those struggling. The cost of living is expected to rise even further after the energy price cap was increased, driving up gas and electricity bills for millions. Inflation is the rate at which prices rise. If a bottle of milk costs £1 and that rises by 5p, then milk inflation is 5%. Why are prices rising so quickly?\n'My pay isn't keeping up with rising prices'\nTesco vows to rein in prices as profits treble\nStudent loan interest rate to hit 12% in England Fuel had the biggest impact on the inflation rate, with average petrol prices rising by 12.6p per litre between February and March, the largest monthly rise since records began in 1990, the Office for National Statistics (ONS) said. This compares with a rise of 3.5p per litre between the same months of 2021. Diesel prices also rose by 18.8p per litre this year, compared with a rise of 3.5p per litre a year ago. The rise in the inflation rate was higher than the 6.7% expected by analysts and was also driven up by furniture, restaurant and food prices. The figures for March do not yet reflect the average £700-a-year increase in energy bills that took place from 1 April when the energy price cap was raised. Since late last year, prices have been rising fast as pandemic restrictions have been eased and firms face higher energy and shipping costs which they have passed on to consumers. Russia's invasion of Ukraine is now adding to the pain, as the price of oil and other commodities climb higher. Russia is one of the world's largest oil exporters and demand for oil from other producers has increased since the invasion, leading to higher prices. Although the UK imports just 6% of its crude oil from Russia, it is still affected when global prices rise. Ukraine and Russia are also the world's main suppliers of sunflower oil and the war has hit prices. In the UK, the price of oils and fats for food increased by 7.2% in March, according to the ONS. Andrew Selley, chief executive of wholesaler BidFood, which supplies 45,000 caterers and food service businesses across the UK, said increasing electricity, fuel and packaging costs were impacting the price of all its products. But he told the BBC products affected by the war in Ukraine, such as wheat-based foods, sunflower oil, chicken and white fish, were particularly hard hit. \"I've been in the business for over 30 years. I've never seen a situation where everything seems to be going up [in price],\" he said, adding that some of these costs would ultimately be passed on to consumers. The firm had previously sourced a lot of its chicken from Poland but Ukrainian workers had returned to fight in the war and the country was keeping more of its chicken to feed refugees meaning it was now sourcing from other countries, driving prices up by a fifth. Sara Gerritsma, a student from Leicestershire with a partner and six year-old child, said she may have to give up her paramedic degree due to the rising cost of fuel. The 32-year-old only started the three-year course in October but she has a 2.5 hour roundtrip each day to get to university in Northampton, and her petrol costs have shot up by about £120 a month. \"It would be really frustrating giving up my course. It was a big decision changing my career at 32,\" Sara told the BBC. \"But recently we have sat down and gone through everything and thought, can I afford to be a full-time student?\" The sharp rise in prices is also putting pressure on businesses. Paul White, who owns the pizzeria 6/CUT in Eccles, Greater Manchester, said the increase in the minimum wage, the end of VAT relief, and rising fuel and food prices have all hit his company. The restaurant is also spending £500 more a week on its energy bills. \"We need to find an extra £1,400 a week to cover the costs of everything that's come on in the last few weeks,\" he told the BBC. He says he will have to put up prices, and is looking to charge each customer about 50p to £1 extra to cover his rising overheads. But he is also worried people might start eating out less as their budgets are squeezed. This is no longer a cost of living squeeze, but a financial throttling for many people. Price rises are accelerating and their wages, benefits and pensions are failing to keep pace. In the words of the ONS, there were \"no large offsetting downward contributions\" to the inflation rate. In other words, nothing is getting significantly cheaper. So avoidance of price rises is impossible. Even if you do not have a car and are avoiding surging fuel costs, lots of other necessities are getting more expensive. Experts say the only option is trying to budget as best we can, across every part of our lives. Most importantly, they also stress the importance of seeking early, and free, help before falling into unmanageable debt. Research for the consultancy Retail Economics found the least affluent UK households saw discretionary income fall by 5.2% or £26 in March, compared with the same month last year. The Retail Economics-HyperJar Cost of Living Tracker said households on average incomes had £52 each less spare cash, a fall of £52. Chief executive Richard Lim said it was a \"real concern to see the least affluent families under this amount of pressure even before accounting for the energy price hikes\". \"The most disadvantaged households will experience the brunt of the crisis,\" he added. Jack Leslie, senior economist at the Resolution Foundation think tank, which focuses on those on lower incomes, warned the cost of living crisis would \"continue to worsen before it starts to ease at some point next year\". He said with wages not keeping pace with rising prices, people were facing \"the biggest squeeze since the mid-70s.\" Chancellor Rishi Sunak said: \"I know this is a worrying time for many families, which is why we are taking action to ease the burdens by providing support worth around £22bn in this financial year, including for the most vulnerable through our Household Support Fund.\" But Labour criticised the government for increasing taxes when \"the cost of living is hitting households hard\". Liberal Democrats leader Ed Davey called for \"unfair tax hikes\" to be immediately reversed and said people needed \"urgent help\" with energy bills. And the SNP said the \"cost of living crisis continues to spiral out of control with no sign of the UK government stepping up to the challenge to protect families and households\". ",

            "content": "Tesco profits more than trebled last year amid rising sales and a fall in Covid-related costs. The UK's largest supermarket chain reported pre-tax profits of £2.03bn, up from £636m the previous year. Group sales, excluding fuel, rose by 2.5% to £54.8bn, while in the UK retail sales rose by 2.3% year on year. However, Tesco warned of \"significant uncertainties\" and said performance would be affected by the the investment needed to keep prices down. Chief executive Ken Murphy said: \"Clearly, the external environment has become more challenging in recent months. \"Against a tough backdrop for our customers and with household budgets under pressure, we are laser-focused on keeping the cost of the weekly shop in check - working in close partnership with our suppliers, as well as doing everything we can to reduce our own costs.\" Mr Murphy added that Tesco was managing to keep the rise in the cost of living a \"bit under the number for the overall market\". However, products that require a lot of energy to produce are experiencing the highest cost pressures. Tesco accepted a 20% cost price increase in milk from its suppliers less than two weeks ago. However, the UK's largest dairy Arla recently warned that with cost increases of some 36%, farmers faced tough cost challenges. Mr Murphy said strong product availability had been maintained but added that products such as sunflower oil were a challenge due to the war in Ukraine. Tesco staff to see pay rise to £10.10 an hour\nWorst to come for food price rises - Tesco It is also said customer behaviour is also returning to more normal patterns as shoppers rely less on supermarket trips as the UK emerges from the pandemic. Commenting on Tesco profits, chief executive of Retail Economics, Richard Lim said the increases were \"mightily impressive\". As the cost of living crisis continues, Mr Lim said many shoppers would be trading down to own-label brands, switching retailers and scaling back on premium purchases. However, he said Tesco was \"well-positioned\", given the \"competitive advantage\" offered by its loyalty scheme and \"meaningful negotiating power\" it had with suppliers. Tesco online business was lower as sales declined by 6.5% because some customers chose to return to shopping in stores as the pandemic eased. ",

            "content": "The area with the highest amount of warehousing is now synonymous with logistics, business leaders have said. According to figures from the Office of National Statistics (ONS), West Northamptonshire has the most transport and storage premises in the UK. Neighbouring North Northamptonshire had the third highest. Sara Homer, from the Brackmills Business Improvement District, said the county was \"the place to be\" for logistics. The ONS said growth in online shopping has contributed to an increase in the number of warehouses and other logistics premises. It said transport and storage had accelerated in the last two years, following Brexit and the coronavirus pandemic. West Northamptonshire had the highest number of business premises occupied by transport and storage with 3,200, while North Northamptonshire had 2,700, the ONS said. Both areas have also seen a rise in the percentage of premises used for logistics in the last 10 years, and were now both in the top 10 in the UK by that measure. Ms Homer said: \"We are logistics, getting things from A to B is what we are all about.\" Northamptonshire has the M1 and the A14 running through it, is close to the M40 and M6 and has the Daventry International Rail Freight Terminal (DIRFT), with another rail freight terminal being built near Northampton. Howard Wilson from StarTech said the Canadian company, which provides parts for the IT industry, chose Northampton as it UK base because it had \"good infrastructure and there's the right kind of building stock\". But Sean Rose from the Northamptonshire Chamber of Commerce said an emphasis on logistics meant \"there is concern other businesses will struggle to grow\". He said other industries could be \"priced out of the market\" for new premises. Find BBC News: East of England on Facebook, Instagram and Twitter.

            "content": "A major producer of Apple's iPhone has become the latest manufacturer to halt operations because of the lockdown in Shanghai. Technology company Pegatron says it has temporarily suspended production at two of its factories in China. The announcement came even as authorities eased some of Shanghai's coronavirus regulations on Tuesday. It means that some of the city's 25 million people are able to leave their homes for the first time in weeks. The city was locked down in late March after infections surged in the key manufacturing and financial hub. In a stock exchange filing Pegatron said it had halted operations at its factories in Shanghai and nearby Kunshan \"in response to Covid-19 prevention requirements from local government\". The company said it would work with authorities \"to resume the operations as soon as possible\". Major Apple MacBook manufacturer Quanta, and iPad maker Compal Electronics, have also paused activities in Chinese cities, according to Japanese newspaper Nikkei. Pegatron did not give any further details when contacted for comment by the BBC. Apple, Quanta and Compal did not immediately respond to requests for comment. Shanghai's U-turn on its Covid approach\nShanghai lockdown residents 'running out of food' Dan Ives, an analyst at investment firm Wedbush Securities, said he expected the shutdowns to have an impact on production. He estimated that the production of 3 million iPhones has been affected so far this month, \"with more to come if this continues\". Mr Ives also told the BBC that production of 2 million iPads and 1 million MacBooks may also be affected. \"The Pegatron closures throw gasoline on the raging fire which is the supply chain for Apple and other parts of the iPhone ecosystem,\" he said. \"This amplifies supply chain issues for iPhones.\" Another Taiwanese company Foxconn, which also assembles iPhones for Apple, halted operations at its factory in Shenzhen last month. It shifted production to other manufacturing sites, while resuming operations in Shenzhen with employees working in a closed loop system, which saw staff living and working at the plant. Since the pandemic began in 2019, China has enforced shutdowns affecting millions of people in major cities including Xi'an and Wuhan. The lockdown of Shanghai is the largest to date and the city is a key centre for the financial industry, manufacturing and home to the world's biggest port. ",

            "header": "How posh British schools are branching out in Asia",
            "content": "More than 40 years ago, Lyn Khaw traveled thousands of miles from her South East Asian home to study at a top UK school. She says making the move aged 15 afforded her the valuable experience of living and learning independently. Now, Mrs Khaw's son is getting the same opportunity, but without having to be so far from his family in Malaysia. She is among the growing number of well-off parents in Asia sending their children to leading British schools that now have campuses in the region. The schools - set up in South East Asian countries including Malaysia, Singapore and Thailand - have student accommodation on site and largely cater to Western families. But they also admit locals who are able to pay as much as £36,000 ($47,000) a year to study and live at the schools. Are school uniforms too expensive?\nGordon Ramsay sends chef to help at school canteen People across South East Asia spent $80bn on private education last year, an increase from $60bn six years earlier, according to global accounting and consultancy firm EY. EY expects spending, which has been stagnant since the pandemic began, to accelerate in the coming months. \"The British curriculum is well regarded, particularly in countries with historic ties with the UK such as Malaysia, Singapore and Thailand,\" said Luke Pais, EY's Asia Pacific private equity leader. One top school with a presence in the region is Marlborough, where Catherine the Duchess of Cambridge and comedian Jack Whitehall were educated. Marlborough, which is based in the English county of Wiltshire, opened its only overseas campus in the Malaysian city of Iskandar Puteri in 2012. There, its facilities include an organic farm, a golf range, and a lake for water sports - features that are not usually found in local institutions. The Khaws said Marlborough's Malaysian campus being relatively close to the family home in Kuala Lumpur is also one of the reasons for sending their 16-year-old son Ren there. It is just a three-and-a-half-hour drive, or a 50-minute flight from the country's capital, which means he can easily go home for the holidays. Sending him to the school does not come cheap though. It costs the family MYR 200,400 ($47,466; £36,320) a year for him to board there. That is more than five times the average annual wage in Malaysia, according to the latest official figures. Still, a quarter of the students at Marlborough College Malaysia are locals. The hefty price of a British education for her son is worth it for Mrs Khaw, who has fond memories of her time at another leading British public school, Sherborne Girls in Dorset. \"There were obviously school rules, yet also a sense of personal freedom from taking the first steps to becoming independent,\" she said. Meanwhile across the causeway in densely populated Singapore, Dulwich College has several sports fields, three swimming pools, and a performing arts centre with three theatres. With its original location in south London, Dulwich's alumni includes the late Antarctic explorer Ernest Shackleton. The school has branched out of the UK with 10 schools in Asia - the latest being in Yangon, Myanmar's largest city. Another institution that has its sights on the region is Gordonstoun, the Scottish boarding school famous for its association with the British royal family. It plans to open its first international school in China this year, with the ambition to expand in South East Asia in the coming years. The Queen's late husband Prince Philip, their three sons - Charles, Andrew and Edward - as well their daughter Anne's two children were all educated at Gordonstoun. Prince Charles famously made his views clear on the school's austere approach, describing it as \"Colditz in kilts\", in a reference to the World War Two German prisoner-of-war camp. \"The fact that we have educated three generations of the British Royal family, including the heir to the throne, is another attraction for families who want the best education possible for their child,\" Gordonstoun's principal Lisa Kerr told the BBC. \"We already welcome children from a variety of South East Asian countries to our campus here in Scotland but this option is not available or suitable for everyone,\" Ms Kerr said. The schools often draw students from around the region. Well-off parents in countries like Cambodia, for instance, prefer to send their children to the Asian outposts of leading British public schools as they feel confident that they will be taught English, an internationally recognised language, and other subjects to a high level, according to Kimkong Heng, a visiting senior research fellow at the Cambodia Development Center. \"Cambodia lags behind many countries in the region in terms of educational standards, research and innovation,\" Mr Heng told the BBC. \"It looks up to the Singaporean or Malaysian standards. And of course the goal is the European and American educational standards.\" However, Mr Heng believes that attending a South East Asian branch of a top British school still does not completely match up to the experience of the original historic institutions. \"We dream to visit world-famous cities like London and study in world-renowned universities [there]. The standard of education is one thing, but the experience of the culture and language is another,\" he said. Mr Pais said the lifting of travel restrictions around the world would benefit British public schools. He added: \"There are several attractive characteristics of South East Asia that supports the growth of private education - rising affluence, a favourable regulatory environment and limited high-quality supply.\" ",

            "header": "Warning travel problems could continue into summer",
            "content": "Worker shortages mean airports and ports are facing a \"very difficult summer\", a border staff union has said. Lucy Moreton, from the Immigration Services Union, warned that Border Force was \"catastrophically under-staffed\" and that it took nearly a year to fully train new officers. Meanwhile, one aviation recruitment expert said it would take at least 12 months for shortages to settle down. Some travellers have seen long queues and cancellations over Easter. The travel industry cut thousands of jobs during the pandemic, but as demand for flights has returned, it has struggled to recruit, carry out security checks and train new staff quickly enough. \"For the first time in living memory, Border Force is no longer attracting enough candidates to fill the vacancies that they've got,\" Ms Moreton told the BBC. \"Combined with the fact it takes nearly a year to fully train a Border Force officer, we're going into not just this summer but this weekend catastrophically under-staffed, with people beginning to travel again.\" What's causing flight disruption this Easter?\nAirport warns of queues as travel delays continue While she said it was right that no corners were cut with training and security clearances, Ms Moreton said more resources would help. She said cash incentives were being offered for working shifts at London's Heathrow Airport, while staff from Scotland and Northern Ireland were also being brought down to provide cover. However, she added: \"This is a very expensive proposition that resourcing it properly in the first place would have avoided.\" The Aviation Recruitment Network, which is working with airports including Heathrow, Gatwick, Stansted and Manchester, said it currently had more than 300 live vacancies - a record for this time of year. Kully Sandhu, the organisation's managing director, told the BBC he believed it would take at least 12 months for recruitment problems to be resolved. \"Brexit has not helped with the issues we're facing at the moment because we had a natural attraction of individuals from the European market who would apply for vacancies within UK airports,\" he told the BBC. \"We no longer have that talent pool to recruit from and we are relying on individuals within the UK.\" Heathrow has said security checks and training mean it can take three to six months before new recruits can start working. It is aiming to have 1,000 new security officers recruited and in their posts by the summer. On Monday, Heathrow admitted resources were \"stretched\", as it revealed March was its busiest month since the start of the pandemic. The airport warned of \"congestion in check-in areas at peak times\" and said it was \"working closely with airlines and ground handlers to make sure this increase in demand can be met while keeping passengers safe\". The Home Office also said travellers may face longer waits than usual over the Easter period due to high passenger numbers. \"Border Force's number one priority is to maintain a secure border, and we will not compromise on this. We are mobilising additional staff to help minimise queuing times for passengers and will continue to deploy our staff flexibly to manage this demand,\" a statement said. Last week, Ken O'Toole, the deputy chief executive of Manchester Airports Group, said staff shortages meant long queues at security could continue for four to six weeks. Meanwhile, airlines have been hit by Covid-related absences, with EasyJet and British Airways cancelling flights as a result. EasyJet chief executive Johan Lundgren said the company had seen absence rates of 20% in some cases. But he said delays in processing security checks for new airline crew were also contributing to flight cancellations. Mr Lundgren said the airline was waiting for the Department for Transport to give permission for around 100 new members of staff to start work. However, the company said it had flown 94% of its planned schedule in the past seven days, with around 1,500 flights a day - four times higher than this time last year. It added that cancellations had been made as early as possible to enable the majority of customers to rebook onto flights departing the same day. EasyJet said it was seeing strong demand, with summer bookings over the past six weeks above pre-pandemic levels. Have you changed your travel plans due to warnings of disruption?

            "header": "Soaring petrol prices send US inflation to 40-year high",
            "content": "The US inflation rate hit a fresh 40-year high in the year to March after fuel prices soared during the first full month of the Ukraine war. Consumer prices surged by 8.5% - the largest annual gain since December 1981 - following a double-digit rise in energy prices. Last month, President Joe Biden banned all imports of oil and gas from Russia following the invasion of Ukraine. At the same time, US fuel prices reached new records. The attack on Ukraine began on 24 February and triggered a wave of international sanctions against Russia, which is the world's second largest oil exporter. US energy prices rose by 32% in the year to March, according to the country's Labor Department. It also said that food prices had surged over the same period, up by 8.8%. Like energy, food price inflation has been exacerbated by Russia's invasion of Ukraine. Both countries are big exporters of widely-used goods such as wheat and sunflower oil. Kristen Havlik, from North Carolina, said price increases in her area had been \"insane\". \"During the first year of the pandemic, my rent went up by $400 a month which was extremely hard to afford as I had lost majority of my income from one of my jobs,\" she told the BBC. \"My husband and I were privileged to both secure well paying jobs last year but if we had not, we would have had to move outside of our area to afford to keep living in NC.\" \"We are both still very much working class and now can't save up enough money fast enough to keep up with the insane home-buying market where sellers are making record profits,\" she added. \"The Russia-Ukraine war has added further fuel to the blazing rate of inflation via higher energy, food, and commodity prices that are turbo charged by a worsening in supply chain problems,\" said Kathy Bostjancic, chief US economist at Oxford Economics. The soaring rate of US inflation prompted the Federal Reserve last month to lift its key interest rate for the first time in three years. The US central bank also signalled that the interest will rise a number of times this year. On Tuesday, Russian President Vladimir Putin said that inflation and rising food and petrol prices in Western countries would start to put pressure on politicians there. Inflation rates were already rising before Russia's invasion of Ukraine as many global economies reopened following the lifting of Covid restrictions. However, prices appear to be accelerating at a time when wage growth is struggling to keep up. Recent figures show that average hourly earnings in the US rose by 5.6% in the year to March, well below the latest rise in the cost of living. But some economists believe that inflation may be close to or has already peaked in March. On a month-by-month basis, inflation rose 1.2% in March compared with a 0.8% increase in February. However, stripping out volatile fuel and food prices, core inflation rose by 0.3% which was lower than expected. Peter Cardillo, chief market economist at Spartan Capital Securities, said: \"The bottom line is inflation is going to stick around for a while, but we could see it begin to reverse in the summer months, provided we get some cooling off in agricultural and energy prices.\" ",

            "content": "Public sector pay for jobs such as NHS workers, teachers and civil servants fell further behind price rises in the three months to February, figures show. While wages rose for public sector workers, price rises outpaced them meaning a 3% drop in spending power, the biggest fall in 20 years. In contrast, an average private sector employee's wage bought 0.5% less. The latest inflation figures show the cost of living is rising at its fastest pace for 30 years. \"Basic pay is now falling noticeably in real terms,\" said Darren Morgan from the Office for National Statistics describing the fall in spending power. The most recent figures show that inflation reached 6.2% in February and new data, due out on Wednesday, is expected to show a further rise in March. Tom Southern, a recruitment consultant from Macclesfield, says he and family are having to make cutbacks because of the rising cost of living. The 30-year-old says he recently moved jobs to get a better salary, but it still does not go far enough. \"We're not massively uncomfortable, we have a house and two cars. But it's the little cutbacks you have to make, it starts to add up.\" The father of three says it costs £1.80 a litre to put diesel in the family car and their energy bill has gone from £69 to £268 a month. Their weekly shop at Aldi is up from £50-60 to £80-90. Tom and his partner, who is a midwife, also have loans to pay, childcare costs, and are getting married this month which is another bill to pay. \"I don't see myself as unfortunate, it's other people I feel sorry for,\" he says. \"I don't see how single parents or people on a low wage can make ends meet.\" The ONS said the unemployment rate fell to 3.8% from 3.9% last month. Capital Economics said the fall in unemployment was mainly due to people taking themselves out of the workforce by retiring or by looking after family or long-term sick. Ruth Gregory, senior UK economist at Capital Economics, said the number of people classed as inactive rose by 76,000 in the three month period. At the start of the week, the annual rise in benefits and the state pension came into force. The increase was 3.1%. Now official figures show the average wage is going up by 4%. In normal times, that sounds like a decent rise in income, but these are not normal times. Households are watching most things get more expensive. Prices are rising at over 6% a year and accelerating, outstripping the uplift in benefits and pay. Remember, the target rate for price increases in the economy, as measured by inflation, is 2%. That leaves policymakers with a headache. Either people continue to get worse off, increasing poverty and putting added strain on individuals and the welfare system. Or workers get big pay rises, which bosses can only pay for by putting up prices again - creating what is called an inflationary spiral. Targeted support for those in the most need is another option. Ultimately, it may be that everyone feels some short-term financial pain in the hope, and belief, that those prices rises slow to the 2% target as soon as possible. The number of job vacancies reached a fresh high of 1.29 million between January and March - a rise of 492,400 roles compared with the pre-pandemic first three months of 2020. The ONS said the highest rate of vacancies was in construction, which rose by 18.7% in the first three months of the year. Sectors such as hotels and food services, including restaurants, and entertainment saw job openings increase by 13.1%. However, there was a fall in demand for people in the gas and electricity sectors where vacancy rates dropped by 14%. Chancellor Rishi Sunak said the latest figures \"show the continued strength of our jobs market\", adding that the government was \"helping to cushion the impacts of global price rises through over £22bn of support for the cost of living this financial year\". But Labour's shadow chief secretary to the Treasury, Pat McFadden, said the data shows that \"Conservative choices are leaving real wages squeezed and people worse off\". \"At a time like this, Rishi Sunak could have chosen a one-off windfall tax on huge oil and gas company profits to cut household energy bills by up to £600. \"Instead, he's decided to make Britain the only major economy to land working people with higher taxes in the midst of a cost-of-living crisis,\" he said. Molly Scott Cato, Green Party finance and economy spokesperson, said: \"Rather than a cost of living crisis we should see the perilous situation facing working people as a wages crisis. \"A Green government would introduce taxes on the wealthy and on pollution to fund decent pay rises so that all public service workers get a pay rise that at least matches the cost of living and begins to restore earnings lost over the last decade.\" ",

The Office for National Statistics said regular pay rose by 4% between December and February, and by more than 5% when bonuses were taken into account. But that did not keep up with inflation, which is running at 6.2%. Meanwhile Scotland's unemployment rate fell to 3.5%, down 0.1 percentage points from the previous quarter. It has fallen 0.2 percentage points from the same period two years ago, before the onset of the pandemic. Across the UK, 3.8% of the workforce is unemployed. Pay growth fails to keep pace with cost of living\nScottish business output hits nine-month high However, Scotland's employment rate also fell during the months when a new wave of coronavirus - the Omicron variant - disrupted the economy. It dropped 0.3 percentage points from the previous quarter to 74.7%, according to the ONS Labour Force Survey. That is 0.6 percentage points lower than pre-pandemic levels between December 2019 and February 2020. Early estimates indicate that median monthly pay for payrolled employees in Scotland increased to £2,050 in March 2022 - an increase of 4.4% compared to the same period last year. This is lower than the annual growth in median monthly pay for the UK over the same period (5.9%). Tom Arthur, the Scottish government's public finance minister, said: \"This latest time period reflects the emergence of the Omicron variant at the end of last year, when it was necessary to implement strict public health measures to curtail its spread. \"Separate HMRC early estimates show 2.41m payrolled employees in Scotland in March 2022, 21,000 more than in February 2020, prior to the pandemic. \"While we continue to face economic challenges, with the rising cost of living, the negative effects of Brexit and the potential economic impacts of Russia's illegal invasion of Ukraine, the Scottish government remains committed to doing all we can to help our economy recover.\" Chancellor of the Exchequer Rishi Sunak said: \"Today's stats show the continued strength of our jobs market, with the number of employees on payrolls rising once again in March and unemployment falling further below pre-pandemic levels. \"We are helping to cushion the impacts of global price rises through over £22bn of support for the cost of living this financial year.

            "content": "Sri Lanka has said it will temporarily default on its foreign debts amid its worst economic crisis in over 70 years. Officials said the impact of the pandemic and the Ukraine war made it \"impossible\" to pay its creditors. The South Asian country has seen mass protests as it suffers food shortages, soaring prices and power cuts. It is due to start talks with the International Monetary Fund (IMF) next week on a loan programme to get its economy back on track. Sri Lanka's finance ministry said it otherwise had an \"unblemished record\" of paying its dues since independence from the UK in 1948. \"Recent events, however... have eroded Sri Lanka's fiscal position that continued normal servicing of external public debt obligations has become impossible,\" it said in a statement on Tuesday. The IMF had assessed Sri Lanka's debt to be unsustainable last month, the ministry noted. \"Although the government has taken extraordinary steps in an effort to remain current on all of its external indebtedness, it is now clear that this is no longer a tenable policy,\" it said. \"A comprehensive restructuring of these obligations will be required.\" Why are there mass protests in Sri Lanka?\nFirms struggle amid Sri Lanka's economic crisis\nHow soaring cost of living is hitting Sri Lanka hard Credit rating agencies have not yet classified the move as a default. S&P Global Ratings said it had \"nothing to say at this stage\" when approached by the BBC. In January, the firm lowered Sri Lanka's rating to a classification where it was \"currently vulnerable and dependent on favourable business, financial and economic conditions to meet financial commitments\". Moody's and Fitch Ratings did not immediately respond to requests for comment. Lakshini Fernando of Asia Securities welcomed the move by Sri Lanka's government, and called it \"the better option compared with a hard default\". \"We expect Sri Lanka's current credit rating to be downgraded to 'selective default' or 'restricted default' following the announcement,\" Ms Fernando said. She noted that Sri Lanka had $78m (£60m) in international sovereign bond payments due next week. Sri Lanka's foreign reserves stood at $1.93bn at the end of March. However, it has around $4bn in foreign debt payments due this year. The country recently named a new central bank chief and almost doubled its key interest rate to help tackle soaring prices and shortages of essential goods. In recent weeks, demonstrators have taken to the streets of the capital Colombo as homes and businesses were hit with long power cuts. Sri Lankans are faced with shortages and rising inflation after the country steeply devalued its currency last month ahead of talks with the IMF over a bailout. ",

            "content": "Sales in shops have slowed as household budgets come under pressure from the rising cost of living, the British Retail Consortium (BRC) has said. Its figures show sales growth for March rose by 3.1%, the smallest increase so far this year and down from a 6.7% rise in February. It comes as millions are having to deal with higher energy bills and taxes. The BRC said pressure on people's finances and the war in Ukraine had \"shaken consumer confidence\". Helen Dickinson, chief executive of the BRC, said customers faced \"an enormous challenge this year\" around their finances, which was \"likely to be reflected in retail spend in the future\". Online fashion giant Asos said on Tuesday that its sales forecasts for the next few months carried greater uncertainty than usual as it was still unclear how the rising financial pressures on consumers would affect their spending. Small business owners told the BBC they had seen a recent dip in sales compared to previous months at a time when they were also having to grapple with higher operating costs. Lucy Rushton, owner and founder of the Cheshire Gift Company, said she believed a lot of people were starting to be more prudent with their spending. \"Going into Easter, sales have definitely been lower than they were last year,\" she said. Ms Rushton, who started her business online and stored products in her garage before moving to a warehouse, told the BBC the company's social media presence had helped with sales from loyal customers. But she added: \"I would be lying if I was not worried looking to the next year.\" Ms Rushton said she and her staff wear thermals to avoid putting the heating on in the company's warehouse due to high energy costs. \"It is cold in the warehouse [but] I would rather keep my staff in jobs,\" she said. She said higher shipping and packaging costs were having the biggest impact on her profits, but her team had \"adapted\" and found new ways to get the best value for money without having to pass on big price increases to customers. With inflation rising at its fastest rate for 30 years, people in the UK are facing increased pressure from living costs. Fuel, energy and food prices have seen some of the biggest increases. The rate at which prices rise has been forecast to reach 8.7% in the final three months of 2022, which means households may be forced to cut back. Bev Logan, who set up her online women's sportswear business Badass Mother Runners during the first Covid lockdown, said sales had been strong until they \"nosedived\" in April. \"It's just a bit weird\", she said. \"April hit and things went eerily quiet. \"It's scary being a small business owner as your bills are going up just like everyone else's, but your sales are going down. It's understandable that people have to be careful but it's a worry for many small businesses.\" Five reasons why prices and bills are going up\nWhat is inflation? Don Williams, retail partner at KPMG, said the slower rate of sales in March suggested \"clouds on the horizon as household budgets come under pressure from rising costs, an increasing tax burden and competition from holidays\". \"Additionally, retailers are facing their own battle with rising costs and inflation, and are walking a tightrope between absorbing rising costs themselves or passing these on to consumers,\" he added. He said the big question was whether shoppers will reduce their physical and online shopping baskets in turn. The figures from the BRC-KPMG retail sales monitor showed that overall sales fell by 0.4% in March from 12 months earlier. Food sales for the month fell year-on-year and online sales for non-food items also decreased by 29%, compared with growth of 64.7% the year before. Susan Barratt, chief executive of the Institute of Grocery Distribution, said food and drink sales figures faced tough comparisons to last year, when some lockdown restrictions started to ease. \"Easter was also earlier and we're yet to see holiday spending ramp up this year,\" she pointed out.

            "header": "Tree-planting driving up rural land prices",
            "content": "Land values in Scotland are booming because investors are putting cash into forestry and tree-planting to offset carbon emissions, a new report says. The Scottish Land Commission said exceptionally high demand and low supply meant prices had risen sharply. The report said there was more demand for smaller farms because of the lifestyle attractions. And more corporate money - often from overseas - was looking for environmental investments. The Scottish Land Commission (SLC) is a Scottish government agency which looks at the concentration of land ownership and its effective use. Hamish Trench, from the SLC, said the report showed that demand for rural land from different types of buyer had increased significantly and was raising prices. The report found a growing number of non-farming investors who were influenced by long-term investment potential as well as ESG (environmental, social and governance) considerations, which promote a more sustainable corporate approach. It said farmland values had risen by 31.2% in Scotland in 2021 compared with 6.2% across UK. The Scottish government has a target of 18,000 hectares (44,500 acres) of new woodland each year by 2024/25 in an attempt to offset the effects of climate change. Could Scotland see a 'green laird gold rush'? Land reform campaigners have warned of businesses buying up land in Scotland to offset their carbon emissions rather than reducing what they emit. Green laird is a term that has been used to describe a business buying thousands of acres of land to plant with trees to help it achieve net zero - a balance between the carbon emitted into the atmosphere, and the carbon removed from it. Scottish Land & Estates, which represents rural land-based businesses, said it was unsurprising that potential buyers were responding to clear government signals to plant more trees. Land ownership is politically sensitive, in Scotland and in many countries around the world. That's partly because we all use it, but also because it has cultural, environmental and economic heft. Yet for all the hopes of radical land reform when the Scottish Parliament started work in 1999, there remains little to discourage secretive corporate and foreign money from buying up large chunks of Scotland and doing, quite often, not much with it of any use to the wider community. The legislated land reform we've seen is aimed at support for communities to get at least the opportunity to buy land when it comes on the market. But today's report points to a sharp increase in off-market deals, which give those communities no chance of putting their case and their finance together. There are several reasons for doing deals without transparency, in addition to subversion of that legal intent; it works for brokers to shift assets on their books to known investors on their books: some farmers don't want their neighbours to know they are \"selling out\" for forestry, which carries social disapproval in some farming circles. The buyers of estates used to want prestige and private lodges with bounteous space for hunting, shooting and fishing. Such owners tend to hang on to their land for a long time, and across generations. Demand for property far outstrips supply, which is the simple explanation for prices soaring. However, this report suggests that there is \"declining social acceptability of driven grouse shooting\". Investors in the 2020s, typically younger, are more focused on land as a means of getting to net zero - as investment for forestry planting or existing woodland, either of these mean owners can offset their carbon emitting activities elsewhere. That's why a company such as Brewdog and its \"punk\" equity investors own a Highland estate, and new investment vehicles are joining it. With land, the company or investor can get a certified store of carbon roughly equal, it is claimed, to the emissions from burning natural gas in the process of brewing beer in Ellon. This follows the policy of Westminster and Holyrood governments to boost tree planting on a massive scale. And it helps that the poor quality of land across much of Scotland is of much higher value for forestry than for grouse moor and sheep grazing. As the prices for upland farms rise relative to more productive agricultural land further down the strath, upland hill farmers can sell up to rich investors, and buy a smaller holding with which to change the way they farm. Part of the demand for Scottish farms is also coming from English farmers selling up at higher values and with tax advantages from doing so. This could have profound implications for rural Scotland. A rapid shift in the market that could bring major changes in the way Scotland looks, and in the type of jobs to be found in rural Scotland. One of the challenges is for communities, and the agencies that represent them, to engage with new owners to ensure there is a social dimension to their investing, which engages local people. The other challenge is to those who set policy on land ownership, notably at Holyrood: how much are they letting this shift in the market determine the future of Scottish land, ownership and farming? And what more do they need to do to have the policies, financial incentives and laws in place to achieve a broad mix of ownership and the best possible environmental and social outcomes for the nation? The report recognises that there is an element of speculation in the land market as investors look for a safe haven in a turbulent global economy and gamble on future carbon values rising. Strong growth in land values is expected to continue due to continued low supply and high demand driven by the long-term policy on climate change and increasing pressure on the global timber market. In the Scottish estates market there was an estimated 87% increase on prices paid in 2020, and last year two estates sold for more than £20m, while five sold for between £10-£20 million. About one third of buyers were from overseas. Mr Trench said: \"The way the land market functions is important to Scotland's ambitions such as net zero, nature restoration, repopulation, and community empowerment. \"Being able to participate in the market shapes not just who owns Scotland's land, but who is able to make decisions and who benefits from land and its economic, social and environmental value.\" Sarah-Jane Laing, chief executive of Scottish Land & Estates, which represents rural land-based businesses, said: \"It is unsurprising that potential buyers are responding to clear government signals to plant more trees and sequester more carbon as part of a global effort to tackle climate change. \"Long-term investment in forestry is attractive to landowners and farmers as there is less volatility compared with some markets for farming produce. \"However, as stated in the report, carbon is only the motivation for some buyers and it is clear that from this small sample of land sales that about half of buyers are acquiring estates and land for other reasons.\" ",

Means-tested payments, like Universal Credit, and the state pension have risen by 3.1%. But official figures show that prices are rising twice as fast, and they are expected to accelerate further. The new rates were set last year - before household bills soared to the highest level in decades. Benefits and pension rise outpaced by higher costs\nHow we cut back: Skipping meals and fewer car journeys\nFive reasons why prices and bills are going up\nWarning of fresh energy bill shock in October Charities say this increase in state payments fails to tackle the cost of living pressure. Annie McCormack, from Perth & Kinross-based charity Broke Not Broken, said people in the most deprived situations are being driven further into poverty. She said: \"Everything is increasing in cost yet benefits are only increasing by 3%. \"People are telling us they can only put the heating on once a week. There is going to be an increased pressure on community groups and food banks who will not be able to cope. The pressure is unsustainable. \"It is not a case of saying 'lucky them' getting a 3% increase in their benefits. That 3% is getting gobbled up in the energy bills. \"Access to adequate food and housing are human rights and those rights are being breached with people not able to afford adequate food\". It is estimated around half a million people across Scotland are in receipt of Universal Credit. The UK government said it has provided billions of pounds in extra support to help people pay their bills. Patricia Gill lives with her partner in Castlemilk, Glasgow. The 36-year-old is in receipt of Universal Credit. She has a teenager daughter and is due to have her second baby this October. She told the BBC: \"My bills have gone through the roof. This rise today in benefits won't really make a difference because we have got our private-let rent, gas and electricity.\" Patricia has a pre-payment meter which means she pays for her energy as she uses it. She described how she slipped in to her emergency supply last week due to low funds: \"We used to pay £10 per week on our electricity and now it is up to £30. \"A few days ago we hit the emergency credit. So I just topped it up again and that will only last us three days if we are lucky. \"It is a worry. We are just trying to make do as best we can.\" Prices are rising at their fastest rate for 30 years. Inflation is currently 6.2% but forecasters expect it to peak at close to 9% later this year due to more expensive gas and electricity bills. A UK government spokesman said: \"We recognise the pressures people are facing with the cost of living, which is why we're providing support worth £22bn [across the UK over] the next financial year and benefits are being uprated by the usual measure, September's inflation figure.\" He added that support also included cutting fuel duty and money to help pay for energy bills. The minimum wage had also been increased. Normally under the triple lock formula, pensions increase by either inflation, the increase in earnings between May and July, or 2.5% - whichever is highest. UK ministers said last September that the figures had been \"skewed and distorted\" by the average earnings rise, which was \"statistical anomaly\", owing to the impact of Covid and the withdrawal of furlough. The House of Commons Library said that would have been about 8% and cost an extra £4bn to £5bn. So the UK government decided to limit this April's rise to the greater of the inflation rate last autumn or 2.5%, hence the 3.1% increase now. June Hickman, a pensioner from Aberdeen, told BBC Scotland: \"I feel really angry. The pension did not go up as we expected it. \"I only retired in January. Lucky I managed to get a couple of days work a week otherwise I would not have managed. The heating bills alone are crippling. It's upsetting. It's scary.\" Another pensioner, John Shepherd, said: \"Our pensions are not keeping up with the rate of inflation. \"I am cutting down the heating and I am watching what I am eating.\" The Scottish government has control of eight devolved social security benefits. Ministers have increased them to 6% to cope with the cost of living crisis. Social Security Minister Ben Macpherson said: \"We have acted urgently in response to growing pressures on the costs of living. \"We wrote to the UK government before the recent budget to urge them to increase benefits by more than 3.1% and it is extremely disappointing they chose not to do so.\" ",

We have got into debt this year. This is all going to burst at some point.\" Five reasons why prices and bills are going up\nWarning of fresh energy bill shock in October She said she wished she could work, but was unable to due to ill health. People she knew who were doing two jobs - as she used to - were still struggling to cope financially, she added. The extra government household support grant she received had been spent on gas bills, she said. Long-standing policy links the rise in a series of benefits and tax credits each April to the rate of inflation the previous September. That is why means-tested benefits such as universal credit, as well as disability and carer's allowances, have now gone up by 3.1%. The actual amounts individuals receive depends on their circumstances. Child benefit has also gone up by 3.1% to £21.80 a week for the eldest child, and £14.45 a week for other children. Andrew McIntyre owes his energy supplier £1,200, and his monthly bill is about to go up from £75 to £120 a month. The 57-year-old lives off universal credit, and already regularly faces a shortfall between what he has got coming in and what he needs to pay on bills. As he gets ready to go to a local food charity for a free meal - something he does one day a week and likes to get dressed up smartly for - he explains that it means he has had to choose between paying his rent and heating his flat. \"Every month I'm robbing Peter to pay Paul,\" he says. Andrew gets £325 a month in universal credit, and £351 a month in housing benefit. He has no savings. He pays £400 for rent, leaving him with £276 for food and bills. \"If I can eat late in the morning then I don't have to eat again until my evening meal,\" he says. Read more about how people are coping with the rising cost of living Dame Clare Moriarty, chief executive at Citizens Advice, said: \"We've heard stories of families resorting to heating up tins of beans over a tealight, or choosing between giving their kids a hot bath at bedtime and putting on the heating for an hour while they dress for school. With energy bills rocketing this month, things will only get worse. \"At the bare minimum, the government should reconsider and increase benefits by the current inflation rate to help people keep up with the rapidly rising cost of living. And as costs continue to soar, they must bring in further support to stop more households being pushed into hardship.\" A government spokesman said: \"We recognise the pressures people are facing with the cost of living, which is why we're providing support worth £22bn across the next financial year and benefits are being uprated by the usual measure, September's inflation figure.\" He added that support also included cutting fuel duty and money to help pay for energy bills. The minimum wage had also been increased. If the rate of inflation is high in September, then benefits could rise significantly in April 2023, when the rate of price increases is forecast to slow. The uprating of some social security benefits is devolved, with the Scottish government setting a 6% increase in eight of them from 1 April. The move affected the Job Start Payment, Young Carer's Grant, Funeral Support, three Best Start Grants and Carer's Allowance Supplement - which had all been due to increase by 3.1%. It also covered Child Winter Heating Assistance, which was to rise by 5%. Ministers said it was an \"urgent\" response to growing pressures on the cost of living.

The House of Commons Library said that would have been about 8% and cost an extra £4bn to £5bn. So the government decided to limit this April's rise to the greater of the inflation rate last autumn or 2.5%, hence the 3.1% increase now. It means: The full, new flat-rate state pension (for those who reached state pension age after April 2016) is £185.15 a week, a rise of £5.50 a week\nThe full, old basic state pension (for those who reached state pension age before April 2016) is £141.85 a week, a rise of £4.25 a week. They may also get a Pension Credit top-up Work and Pensions Secretary Therese Coffey has committed to reinstating the triple lock from now on, telling the Commons: \"I am again happy to put on record that the triple lock will be honoured in the future.\" Jonathan Cribb, associate director at the Institute for Fiscal Studies, said that had the government considered making a change to next year's triple lock promise, it would be a much worse policy that the current temporary suspension. He added that there was a \"good case\" to smooth out pensions and benefits rises but government policy - which included some help with energy bills - should be considered as a whole. ",

            "content": "The UK's economic growth slowed in February following a sharp fall in the production of cars and computer goods. The Office for National Statistics (ONS) said the economy expanded by 0.1% compared with 0.8% in January. The fall in manufacturing was off-set by growth in the services sector including areas such as tourism and travel. The ONS also said that the UK economy is 1.5% above its pre-coronavirus pandemic level in February 2020. Economists had been expecting gross domestic product (GDP) - which measures activity in services, construction and industrial production - to grow by 0.3% in February following the lifting of most Covid restrictions in England at the end of January. \"The pace of the recovery was already going to slow once the post-Omicron bounce faded and the squeeze on household real incomes intensified,\" said Ruth Gregory, senior UK economist at Capital Economics. \"But we hadn't expected it to slow so much so soon.\" Alpesh Paleja, lead economist at the CBI, a business lobby group, said: \"Near-term challenges to the outlook have ramped up since, with a growing cost-of-living crunch set to weigh on growth,\" he said. \"Businesses are also grappling with headwinds from the Ukraine conflict, which is exacerbating cost pressures and supply chain disruption.\" Chancellor Rishi Sunak said he \"welcomed\" February's growth figures. He said: \"Russia's invasion of Ukraine is creating additional economic uncertainty here in the UK, but it is right that we are responding robustly against Putin's unprovoked invasion.\" The ONS said the fall in industrial production was due to a 5.4% drop in the manufacture of transport equipment \"driven entirely by the fall in manufacture of cars\". It added that production of computer and electronic products had fallen in February. Barret Kupelian, senior economist at the accountancy firm PwC UK, said: \"This is an area other European economies have also been struggling with, because of the semiconductor shortage. \"Manufacturing is also likely to face headwinds due to high energy prices as it consumes above average energy per unit of GDP and we will see this reflected in future data releases.\" The construction sector also contracted but at a slower rate than production industries. Capital Economics said the fall was, in part, \"driven by Storm Eunice, Dudley and Franklin resulting in construction projects being delayed\". The services sector provided the only bright spot in the data as post-Omicron spending on leisure continued, with growth in accommodation as well as travel agencies and tour operators. Mr Kupelian said growth momentum \"shifted towards the sectors of the economy which were hardest hit during the pandemic, including accommodation and food services, activities and arts, entertainment, and recreation\". He said: \"We expect that there is still more growth to come from these sectors.\" ",

            "content": "Elon Musk has decided not to join the board of Twitter, the company's chief executive Parag Agrawal says. Mr Musk's appointment was due to become effective on Saturday after revealing last week that he had bought a 9.2% stake in the social media platform. However, Mr Agrawal tweeted: \"Elon shared that same morning that he will no longer be joining the board.\" The Tesla boss remains Twitter's largest shareholder and the firm will remain open to his input, he added. Just over an hour after Mr Agrawal's announcement, Mr Musk cryptically tweeted a single emoji. The tweet has since been deleted. The BBC is not responsible for the content of external sites.\nView original tweet on Twitter Over the weekend, the Tesla chief suggested changes to the Twitter Blue premium subscription service, including slashing its price, banning advertising and giving the option to pay in the cryptocurrency dogecoin. Mr Musk also asked his more than 81 million followers whether Twitter is \"dying\" and if its headquarters should be turned into a homeless shelter. And he created a poll asking whether the letter \"w\" should be removed from the Twitter, with the only options being \"yes\" and \"of course\". The BBC is not responsible for the content of external sites.\nView original tweet on Twitter Mr Agrawal said Twitter offered Mr Musk a seat on its board as the company had believed it was \"the best path forward\", with board members having to \"act in the best interests of the company and all our shareholders\". However addressing Mr Musk's decision to decline, Mr Agrawal said: \"I believe this is for the best\". \"We have and will always value input from our shareholders whether they are on our board or not,\" he added. \"Elon is our biggest shareholder and we will remain open to his input.\" Laura Foll, portfolio manager at Janus Henderson Investors, said: \"The statement from the Twitter chief executive is, I think, quite telling in that he says 'look, Elon decided not to join the board'. It says in the statement the board offered him a seat [and] it was Elon Musk's decision. \"But the Twitter chief executive goes on to say 'there will be distractions ahead but our goals and priorities remain unchanged. Let's tune out the noise.' I think this is the Twitter chief executive saying 'we want to get on with running the business without these distractions'.\" She told BBC Radio 4's Today programme: \"This is a very large publicly listed company. There are very strict rules around what board members, what executive members can say publicly. There has to be very strict controls and I think this is the Twitter chief executive just saying 'let's get on with it now, let's run this company and Elon Musk will be a shareholder and we will listen to him along with shareholders'.\" What are Elon Musk's plans for Twitter?\nElon Musk becomes Twitter's biggest shareholder As the largest shareholder, Elon Musk has more than four times the 2.25% shareholding of Twitter co-founder Jack Dorsey. Shares in Twitter soared by more than 27% last Monday after Mr Musk's stake was revealed. However, many Twitter employees have felt disgruntled by the announcement. According to company insiders, there was anxiety over what impact he would have on the social media company's ability to moderate content in the future. Twitter's chief executive started his statement with a cryptic line. \"Here's what I can share…\" Clearly a lot has gone on behind the scenes that he has left out. The announcement of Elon Musk's appointment to Twitter's board appeared to please everyone. Mr Musk seemed happy, Parag Agrawal tweeted out his approval, as did Twitter's former boss Jack Dorsey. The deal made sense for Twitter. Crucially, in exchange for a board seat, Mr Musk agreed not to buy more than 14.9% of the company. Mr Musk is so wealthy that he could, in theory, afford to buy Twitter outright, very comfortably in fact. His decision to reject the offer of a board seat now leaves the door open, if he so wishes, to take an even larger stake in the company. There are other hints in Mr Agrawal's statement. He says Mr Musk was offered a position on the board - where he would have had to behave in the interests of shareholders. Is this a cryptic clue that Twitter wanted him on the inside, where perhaps he might do less damage? Musk is immensely powerful, his wealth and unpredictability makes him a possibly lucrative but also potentially dangerous investor. He clearly wants to change Twitter. But as a major shareholder with no board seat, what he does next is anyone's guess. ",

            "content": "Ukraine's economy is set to shrink by almost half this year as a result of the war, the World Bank has said. The institution forecasts Russia's invasion will cause more economic damage across eastern Europe and parts of Asia than the coronavirus pandemic. The conflict in Ukraine has shut half of the country's businesses and slashed exports, the World Bank said. Anna Bjerde, the bank's vice-president, said Ukraine needed \"massive financial support immediately\". The bank has sent almost $1bn of assistance to Ukraine so far and has promised a further $2bn in the coming months. It said the closure of Black Sea shipping from Ukraine had cut off some 90% of the country's grain exports and half of its total exports. Ukraine is the world's biggest exporter of sunflower oil and the shutdown of exports has affected global food prices. Ukraine war 'catastrophic for global food'\nUkraine war is economic catastrophe - World Bank The World Bank said the war had made economic activity impossible in large parts of the country, disrupting farming and harvest operations. \"The magnitude of the humanitarian crisis unleashed by the war is staggering. The Russian invasion is delivering a massive blow to Ukraine's economy and it has inflicted enormous damage to infrastructure,\" said Ms Bjerde. The bank said the 45.1% contraction estimate excluded the impact of physical infrastructure destruction, but said this would hamper future economic output further. While Ukraine's economy will suffer the most damage by the war, the World Bank said Russia's economy had been already plunged into a deep recession as a result of sanctions from Western countries. The sanctions have ranged from cutting ties with Russian banks and targeting Russian politicians and oligarchs to banning luxury goods imports and flights. The bank projected Russia's economy would contract by 11.2% in 2022 as the sanctions bite. But while the US has banned all Russian oil and gas imports, the EU, which gets a quarter of its oil and 40% of its gas from Russia, has stopped short of such action. EU countries continue to pay Moscow up to €800m (£674m; $884m) for energy every day, which amounts to an estimated 40% of the Kremlin's income. The EU has proposed a plan to make Europe independent from Russian fossil fuels before 2030. The World Bank said that in addition to Russia and Ukraine, Belarus, the Kyrgyz Republic, Moldova and Tajikistan were projected to fall into recession this year. It said growth projections had been downgraded in all economies because of the war, with weaker-than-expected growth in the euro area. \"The Ukraine war and the pandemic have once again shown that crises can cause widespread economic damage and set back years of per capita income and development gains,\" said Asli Demirgüç-Kunt, World Bank chief economist for Europe and Central Asia.

            "header": "Energy giant Ineos asks to build fracking test site",
            "content": "Energy firm Ineos says it wants to build a fracking test site to show the process can be performed safely. The company claimed extracting shale gas in the UK could make the country \"self-sufficient in 10 years\". The firm has written to the government asking to develop a site, with its boss Sir Jim Ratcliffe saying such a move would \"reduce the cost of energy\" and ensure \"long-term energy independence\". The offer comes after the government ordered a new report into fracking. Last week, it announced the UK's new energy strategy, which included plans to have more nuclear reactors, wind farms and solar energy production. However, the government's strategy made no mention of fracking, a method of extracting gas and oil from shale rock. Fracking involves drilling into the earth and directing a high-pressure mixture of water, sand and chemicals at a rock layer in order to release the gas inside. What is fracking and why is it controversial?\nMinister orders review of fracking impact\nHow high could my energy bills go? The technique was halted in the UK in 2019 amid opposition from green groups and concerns over earth tremors, but there have been calls to rethink the ban, given the recent rise in the cost of energy. Sir Jim, the founder and chairman of Ineos, said that with the UK in the \"midst of an energy crisis\", it was a \"ridiculous situation with so much gas under our feet\". He said extracting shale gas would allow \"the UK to benefit from its own resources, massively reduce the cost of energy and ensure our long-term energy independence\". \"We are today offering to drill a shale test site to show that a competent operator can be trusted to develop the technology safely,\" he added. Ineos said while it was invested in what it called the \"growing renewables revolution\", the technology was not yet reliable enough to take over. The company said the UK would need gas for three decades as it moves completely away from burning fossil fuels. \"Fracking has been safely used in the oil and gas industry for over 50 years. In the US, over one million wells have been safely used and have transformed the energy security of the country,\" Ineos said. The UK met 48% of its gas demand from domestic supplies in 2020, and bought the rest on international markets, according to the Department for Business, Energy and Industrial Strategy. Russia's invasion of Ukraine has led to many countries, particularly European Union members who rely heavily on Russian gas and oil, considering where they get their supplies of energy from. Ineos's call for a fracking test site comes after the boss of British Gas owner Centrica said the process could boost UK energy supplies and reduce bills. Chris O'Shea said there needed to be an \"informed debate\" about it. Some senior Conservatives have also called for a rethink on fracking amid concerns over security of access and rising energy prices. However, environmental group Greenpeace has said there has been \"a decade of hype and bluster\" around shale gas. Previously, Greenpeace said that fracking would not improve energy security, because any gas extracted would belong to the gas firm doing the drilling, not to Britain, and it would be sold on international markets. Many environmental groups have said they are concerned about the potential for fracking to cause earthquakes. At Cuadrilla's site in Lancashire, more than 120 small tremors were recorded while it was drilling. Sir Jim said Ineos would invite government inspectors to monitor any potential test site. \"If at any stage the science shows there are problems, we will stop and make good the site,\" he said. \"But if, as we believe, the opposite is true, we would ask that the government looks again at shale gas which would allow the UK to benefit from its own resources, massively reduce the cost of energy and ensure our long-term energy independence.\" ",

            "content": "Most of us have probably done it pre-pandemic, gone into work with a cough or sniffles - but unions want attitudes towards working with viruses to change. Now we are learning to live with Covid and self-isolation is guidance and no longer law, employers are being asked to take a more \"mature\" approach about wanting unwell staff to work. Not just Covid, but any contagious illnesses like colds and flu. One union member said it was \"important\" firms learn from Covid. Most of the remaining Covid restrictions in the UK have ended while a few rules remain in Wales and Scotland. Nearly 4.9 million people across the UK would test positive for Covid, according to the latest official stats, which is about 25,000 lower than last week's record high. What are the UK's remaining Covid restrictions?\nHave I got Covid, a bad cold or something else?\nNine new Covid symptoms added to official list Due to the pandemic, people in certain occupations have the ability to work from home - with about 5.6 million people in the UK doing that during the height of the pandemic. Now Graham Perkins, who is a member of union USDAW, which represents about 400,000 workers, has explained why businesses will be better off not expecting all potential infectious staff, not just those with Covid, into work. \"I have concerns that there is going to be pressure on workers to come into work, even if they are feeling unwell. \"I think the workers even now at these late stages of the pandemic, are already starting to feel those pressures, whether they are implicit or explicit, they are there. \"It's really important that the learnings that we've taken from this pandemic are that we can work from home. \"Bosses really do need to be aware that illnesses can be spread amongst the workforce, and that does affect productivity - and there is a case to be made for working from home when possible.\" Teachers, according to the largest education union, \"feel that they can't leave their class because want to be there for the children who are learning\". \"In the past in lots of sectors, people have come into work when they haven't been feeling very well,\" said Mary van den Heuvel of the National Education Union, which represents more than 500,000 teachers. \"But as we've seen in the past couple of years, Covid has really made it essential that people stay off work if they're poorly. \"So we would be encouraging schools to encourage their staff to stay at home, take a test, work from home where possible and self isolate.\" In the UK, isolation advice varies depending if you live in England, Wales, Scotland or Northern Ireland. The UK government's Living with Covid plan was designed to help businesses get employees back in the office in what Prime Minister Boris Johnson described as a \"transition back to normality\". Yet Covid-related staff absences among airport and airline staff have played a part in the travel disruption holidaymakers have faced in the Easter getaway. Which treatments work best against Covid?\nHow to look after yourself if you get Covid\nCovid infections show signs of plateauing in UK Although unions have said organisations should not want potentially contagious staff back in the workplace, they are aware many of their members would want to go back to work because they do not get paid absence. \"At the root of it is sick pay and whether the extent to which sick pay is causing people to return to work sooner than they might do ordinarily,\" said Lesley Richards, of HR firm the Chartered Institute of Personnel and Development (CIPD). \"We can't forget the economic angle to it as well where people's costs are rising and we need to think about whether the statutory sick pay system is sufficient and effective to enable people to take that time off if they need to and whether employers need be doing something around the occupational sick pay to top that up. \"This is a chance for organisations to take a more mature approach to people being sick, particularly with contagious diseases. \"Responsible employers will be trying to prevent contagion in the workplace due to the dual impact on people and productivity.\" The CIPD boss in Wales also said there is also \"a risk people will stop testing because it doesn't make a difference is there's no requirement to self-isolate\". Union bosses have warned their staff that if they do feel unwell, especially with Covid to \"stay at home and don't spread this.\" But Mr Perkins USDAW admitted: \"I've seen it several times amongst my colleagues where people have decided not to self-isolate, decided not to LFT, simply because they're not going to get paid, because the rules of sick pay are so very strict at the moment. \"I totally get that there is there is a need for looking at the needs of the business, the needs of the economy. But we also need to look after our workers because they're the people that are putting that effort into the economy.\" The UK government said it has ended self-isolation payments now the law has been scrapped. \"It's up to employers to determine their sick pay policies and many employers choose to pay more than the minimum level,\" the government said in a statement.

            "content": "A \"real embargo\" on Russian energy by Western countries could stop war in Ukraine, President Putin's former chief economic adviser has suggested. Dr Andrei Illarionov said Russia \"did not take seriously\" other countries' threats to reduce their energy usage. Despite trying to reduce its reliance on Russian sources, Europe is continuing to buy oil and gas. Last year, soaring prices meant oil and gas revenues accounted for 36% of Russia's government spending. Much of that income comes from the European Union, which imports about 40% of its gas and 27% of its oil from Russia. This week, its top diplomat Josep Borrell said \"a billion [euros] is what we pay Putin every day for the energy he supplies us\". EU unveils plan to end reliance on Russian gas\nWest hits Russia with oil bans and gas curbs\nCould the world cope without Russian oil and gas? Dr Illarionov said if Western countries \"would try to implement a real embargo on oil and gas exports from Russia... I would bet that probably within a month or two, Russian military operations in Ukraine, probably will be ceased, will be stopped\". \"It's one of the very effective instruments still in the possession of the Western countries,\" he added. While the oil and gas trade has continued during the conflict, widespread sanctions mean that a lot of other economic activity has stopped, many foreign companies have pulled out and exports have been disrupted. One recent survey by Russia's own central bank even forecasts the economy will shrink by 8% this year, while the International Institute of Finance says it could fall by as much as 15%. Dr Illarionov suggested that President Putin was prepared to endure a hit to the economy that shows where his priorities lie. \"His territorial ambitions, his imperial ambitions, are much more important than anything else, including the livelihood of the Russian population and of the financial situation in the country... even the financial state of the his government,\" he said. Last week, amid tensions with Europe over how gas would be paid for, President Putin said that \"key indicators\" of the health of the Russian economy include the \"creation of jobs, the reduction of poverty and inequality, the improvement of the quality of life of people, the availability of goods and services\". World Bank figures suggest that almost 20 million Russians live in poverty. President Putin has, in recent years, pledged to halve that number. Now Dr Illarionov said \"we'll see probably doubling the number of those people, maybe even tripling\" as the economy struggles. The Moscow-based think tank, the Centre for Strategic Research, estimated two million jobs could be lost this year as the unemployment rate rises from a record low. Those concerns are shared by Vladimir Milov, who is a former Russian deputy energy minister, but is now part of Alexei Navalny's Russia of the Future opposition party. \"Many people are concerned about losing their jobs, I think it's just that the majority does not really realise the severity of the economic situation,\" he said. Inflation, which has already risen to 15.7% because of the war, means people might stop spending money on things such as gyms and meals in restaurants and \"that's bad news for a lot of small businesses\", said Mr Milov. Some basic food items such as sugar, onions and cabbages have risen in price by more than 40% since the start of this year. Mr Milov said any noticeable falls in living standards would help his party's cause as an opposition. \"We have been explaining to people all along [that] Putin's policy would lead Russia into a catastrophe, including a complete social and economic catastrophe, including [a] deterioration of living standards that we haven't seen in decades,\" he said. \"I have to say that comes at an extremely high price. We would prefer not to see what is happening today.\" Will Russia be able to pay its debts?\nCanada pledges to help states stop using Russian oil\nUkraine war is economic catastrophe - World Bank However Mr Milov, who fled to Lithuania last year, thinks it will take time for falling living standards to translate to political change. \"Russia is a country with big inertia in society, and a lot of fear instigated by the authorities. Specifically people really are very much afraid of protesting because right now they can end up in jail for a long, long time for doing that\". He added: \"But I would say [that within a] few months [of] real deep economic trouble, that we haven't seen in 30 years, it will change the mood of the society. More people will start to speak out loudly.\" President Putin's former adviser Dr Andrei Illarionov, who now lives in the United States, said a change of government is inevitable \"sooner or later\". He said \"it is absolutely impossible to have any positive future for Russia, with the current political regime\". Under President Putin, he suggested, \"there is no way that country might be integrated back into the international relations, in the world economy\".

            "content": "As home prices in the US surge at record rates, the American Dream is moving out of reach. Ethan Carpe put in more than two dozen offers on homes after starting his house hunt in Phoenix, Arizona in 2020. But as competition heated up, prices in the sprawling desert city jumped 14% in 2020 and then another 32% last year, finally pushing him out of the market. \"It was just absolute insanity,\" says the 29-year-old statistician, who was repeatedly beaten out by buyers offering cash. \"At this point, there's no plan to get back into the market unless something drastic happens,\" he adds. \"If you're not in it right now, it's tough to get in.\" Since 2019, home prices across the US have jumped nearly 30%, as supply hit record lows, according to the National Association of Realtors. Meanwhile household incomes have barely budged. The disconnect has created a rapidly spiralling crisis, as affordability issues, once a problem concentrated in big coastal centres such as New York and San Francisco, have spread throughout the country, touching mid-size cities, small towns - even rural counties. \"You're seeing greater and greater affordability pressures,\" says Alexander Hermann, senior research analyst at Harvard University's Joint Center for Housing Studies. \"And the price growth is not just unprecedented nationally. We're also seeing unprecedented price growth in most markets across the country.\" A typical single family house in the US now costs about $350,000 - more than five times the median household income - a new record. And the rental market - where asking rates surged 14% last year - provides little relief. In Phoenix, known for its sun and vast tracts of suburbia, the pressures are particularly acute. Long a hot spot for retirees, the city of 1.6 million is a prime destination in America's so-called Sun Belt, which has boomed as people head south and south west in search of job opportunities and relatively lower costs. It lies at the heart of Maricopa County, which last year - for at least the seventh year in a row - added more people than any other county in the country, most of them transplants from more expensive places, such as Los Angeles. The influx has pushed up prices and strained supplies, making the area home to the fastest property price increases in the country. \"It's crazy and it doesn't seem to be getting any better any time soon,\" says property agent Butch Lieber, president-elect of the Phoenix Realtors business association. Ethan, originally from California, first moved to the desert town after graduating from a nearby university, joining his brother in the area. He returned in 2019 after graduate school, drawn in part by its relative affordability. He hoped to buy a three-bedroom, two-bath property for about $325,000. But the market - up 6.5% in 2019 - was changing amid a frenzy of bidding wars and cash buyers, at least some of them investors planning to convert the homes to rentals. Now homes like the ones Ethan was considering go for half a million dollars - making his savings insufficient, he says. Ethan says he doesn't want to rent forever, but at the current pace of price increases \"it's going to be tough\". Rents are rising too - up more than 20% in Phoenix last year - making it difficult to stockpile more. \"It's just frustrating,\" says Ethan, whose landlord raised the monthly rent on the two-bedroom property he shares with his girlfriend by $400 - nearly 30% - to $1,750 last autumn. \"You get a raise and it goes straight to the apartment company.\" Analysts say the increasing house prices reflect severe supply shortages, rather than a bubble fuelled by risky lending like the one that precipitated the financial crisis of 2008. But the situation is hardly unique to the US. Since 2015, property prices have increased faster than incomes in most major economies, including Canada, Germany and the UK. The disconnect has worsened since the pandemic hit in 2020, when policymakers around the world slashed interest rates to stabilise the economy, unleashing unusually low borrowing costs. \"We're in kind of a unique time where housing prices are rising disconnected from household income and part of that is because of the incredible amount of money, of finance involved in housing,\" said Suzanne Lanyi Charles, professor of city and regional planning at Cornell University. As the pressures divide the US into a country of housing haves and have nots, they are raising questions about how long such increases can be sustained. At roughly 65.5%, homeownership in the US remains more than three percentage points lower than its peak before the financial crisis - and lower still for younger people and people of colour. Meanwhile, big investors accounted for one in five purchases at the end of last year, according to Redfin. In Phoenix, primary home buyers made up just 64% of the market, Mr Lieber says. \"One wonders if one is creating an America that is permanently separate groups: homeowners doing very well, getting the wealth accumulation, while the first time buyers are simply left out and the American Dream is unattainable,\" says Lawrence Yun, chief economist for the National Association of Realtors. \"Will this fuel social discontent? Right now we are essentially approaching that situation unless we dramatically increase the supply.\" The situation is drawing growing political attention, including calls for more investment in affordable housing and stricter rules for landlords. The market is also responding. Construction has increased and last month America's central bank raised interest rates for the first time since 2018, a move that should help curb price appreciation by cooling demand. But for now, experts say demand so far outstrips supply they expect prices to remain high. And the increased cost will only make it harder for first time buyers and those with moderate or low incomes to get into the market. \"This is something that's going to take a decade or more to really see real progress on,\" says Mr Hermann.

            "content": "A Kinder chocolate factory in Belgium has been ordered to close after it was linked to dozens of salmonella cases. Belgium's food safety authority has also ordered the recall of all Kinder products made at the factory in Arlon, which is owned by Ferrero. Suspected salmonella cases linked to Kinder chocolate have been reported in countries including the UK, Germany, France and Belgium. Ferrero has apologised and acknowledged \"internal failures\". Belgium's food safety authority, the AFSCA, said the factory was ordered to shut after Ferrero was unable to provide complete information for its investigation. The AFSCA said the investigation was ongoing and the factory would only be allowed to reopen if Ferrero could provide the necessary guarantees that it complied with food safety regulations. Belgian Agriculture Minister David Clarinval said in a statement: \"Such a decision is never taken lightly, but the current circumstances make it necessary. The food security of our citizens can never be neglected.\" Kinder sweets recalled in US over salmonella fears\nMore Kinder egg chocolates recalled over salmonella The recall includes all Kinder Surprise, Kinder Surprise Maxi, Kinder Mini Eggs and Kinder Schokobons products. The AFSCA has also asked companies to remove the products from their shelves and advised people not to eat them. On Thursday, Ferrero recalled some of its Kinder chocolates from shops in the US over concerns about potential salmonella contamination. Earlier this week, a number of Kinder Surprise chocolate egg products were also recalled in the UK. On Friday evening, the UK's Food Standards Agency said that none of the products recalled should be eaten, regardless of best before date. All the sweets affected had been made in the same Belgian factory. Tina Potter, head of incidents at the Food Standards Agency, said: \"We have emphasised to the business and the authorities in Belgium the importance of taking as precautionary an approach to their recall as possible and trust that they will continue to put consumers' needs first in any action they take.\" Customers can contact Ferrero directly for a full refund and the products will be taken off the shelves and notices put up in shops to warn consumers. Some Kinder chocolates have also been recalled in parts of Asia, including Hong Kong and Singapore. Ferrero has previously described the recalls as \"precautionary\" and said none of its Kinder products released for sale had tested positive for salmonella. It came after more than 60 people in the UK, mostly young children, became infected with salmonella in an outbreak linked to Kinder Surprise eggs. On Wednesday, Europe's health agency said it was also looking into dozens of suspected cases of salmonella linked with eating chocolate in at least nine countries including the UK, Germany, France and Belgium. It did not mention Ferrero or any other confectioner in a statement, but warned that the reported cases were mostly among children under 10. The salmonella bacteria can cause serious and severe infections, especially in children or elderly people and others with weak immune systems. ",

            "header": "1MDB scandal: Ex-Goldman Malaysia boss found guilty",
            "content": "The former head of Goldman Sachs in Malaysia has been convicted for helping to orchestrate one of the world's biggest financial corruption scandals. A US jury found Roger Ng guilty on all charges in the trial, which concerned the looting of billions of dollars from Malaysia's 1MDB sovereign wealth fund. He is the only Goldman Sachs banker to face a jury over the scandal, which rocked Malaysian politics and forced the bank to pay billions in fines. He had pleaded not guilty. Mr Ng's lawyer said he was a \"fall guy \"and attacked the credibility of the government's star witness, Tim Leissner, who was Mr Ng's boss at Goldman Sachs and pleaded guilty to his role in the scandal in 2018. But after a nearly two-month trial and several days of deliberation, the jury in New York convicted Mr Ng of conspiring to launder money and violating an anti-corruption law. US prosecutors said the decision was \"a victory for not only the rule of law, but also for the people of Malaysia\". \"The defendant and his cronies saw 1MDB not as an entity to do good for the people of Malaysia, but as a piggy bank to enrich themselves with piles of money siphoned from the fund,\" said US Attorney Breon Peace. \"With today's verdict, a powerful message has been delivered to those who commit financial crimes motivated by greed. You will be caught, prosecuted and convicted, like Ng, and face a long prison sentence.\" The charges stemmed from bond deals that Goldman helped arrange in 2012 and 2013 that raised $6.5bn (£5bn) for the 1MDB fund, which was founded to finance public development projects. Authorities say more than $4bn was stolen and spent on art, diamonds and property - even helping to finance Hollywood's Wolf of Wall Street film. Prosecutors said Goldman Sachs bankers helped to arrange laundering of some of the money, some of which was paid as bribes to officials in Malaysia and Abu Dhabi to help win business for the bank. Prosecutors said 49-year-old Mr Ng was central to the scheme, introducing Mr Leissner to Chinese-Malaysian financier Jho Low, the alleged mastermind and a confidant of former Malaysian Prime Minister Najib Razak. Malaysia ex-PM given 12-year term for corruption\nEx-Goldman banker: 'Bribes' made business possible Jho Low was indicted alongside Ng in 2018 but remains at large. They told the court that Mr Ng, who worked for Goldman from 2005 to May 2014, received $35m in kickbacks for his role. Mr Ng's team had claimed the payment was part of a legitimate business deal involving his wife. His lawyer, Marc Agnifilo, also gave the court accounts of Mr Leissner's deceit, calling him a \"double bigamist\" for twice being married to two women at the same time. He previously admitted forging divorce papers to marry an analyst at the bank while still married to his first wife. Mr Ng, who could be sentenced to decades in prison, may appeal, Mr Agnifilo said. In 2020, Goldman reached a $3.9bn settlement with the Malaysian government for its role in the multi-billion-dollar corruption scheme. It also paid nearly $3bn to authorities in four countries to end an investigation into work it performed for 1MDB. The same year, Malaysia's former Prime Minister Najib Razak was sentenced to 12 years in jail after he was found guilty of abusing his power, laundering money and breaching the public's trust. He remains free pending an appeal in Malaysian court. ",

            "header": "Manchester Airport warns of more queues as travel disruption continues",
            "content": "Disruption at airports and the Port of Dover is continuing, ahead of another busy weekend for travel. Thousands of people heading abroad for the Easter holidays have faced long queues, delays and cancellations. Manchester Airport, which has had particular problems for weeks, told the BBC the long waits it has seen at security could continue. At Dover, the suspension of P&O ferry services and bad weather have also caused delays. With passenger numbers increasing after the easing of pandemic restrictions, several airports have been hit by cancellations and long queues. Airports say they are struggling to recruit and train new staff quick enough to cope with demand, leading to staff shortages and delays at check-in and security. Meanwhile, airlines have also been hit by Covid-related staff absences, with a total of more than 100 daily flights being cancelled by EasyJet and British Airways. However, this figure will include dozens of flights cancelled in advance. Transport Secretary Grant Shapps said he was \"very concerned\" about the level of disruption over the Easter holidays. He called on travel operators to \"redouble their efforts\" to make sure people travelling abroad \"can get away as smoothly as possible\". What's causing flight disruption this Easter?\nHow are travel rules being relaxed? Ken O'Toole, the deputy chief executive of Manchester Airports Group, said the next four to six weeks would be a \"difficult period\" for the airport, with some passengers facing queues of 60 to 90 minutes. However, he told the BBC the chaotic scenes last weekend, which saw some passengers miss flights, were an \"isolated incident\". Mr O'Toole said the speed the travel industry had recovered had taken Manchester Airport by surprise, leaving it short-staffed. He added that 220 new staff had been recruited, who were currently being trained and would start work over the coming weeks. In the meantime, he urged travellers to be prepared for longer waits and to arrive three hours in advance to ensure they do not miss their flights around the Easter holidays. \"We want to protect the full flying schedule. We want to make sure that after two years of people not getting away, those trips that they have booked, they can take them,\" he said. \"That unfortunately does mean on occasion there will be queues which are not acceptable, they're not what we're aiming for. \"But the compromise between having that situation or cancelling lots of flights for people - which other airports have done in recent weeks - we believe people would prefer to accept a queue and make sure they get away.\" While Manchester Airport appears to be the worst affected, Heathrow, Gatwick and Birmingham have also been hit by delays and cancellations. The boss of the airlines watchdog has written to UK airlines expressing frustration and concern for holiday-makers. Richard Moriarty, chief executive of the Civil Aviation Authority, said \"late-notice cancellations and excessive delays at airports\" were distressing for passengers and could hit consumer confidence. He called on airlines and airports to work together to ensure disruption is \"kept to a minimum\". A group of schoolchildren told the BBC how upsetting it was for their EasyJet flight from Gatwick to be cancelled, preventing them from joining their classmates on a skiing trip. \"It's really sad, because we had to get up really, really early in the morning for absolutely nothing, just to sit in the airport for about six hours, sitting next to our suitcases looking forward to something that wasn't going to happen,\" one of the girls said. EasyJet apologised and offered further assistance, including a refund. Easter flight cancellations to continue for days\nPassengers swapping flights to avoid airport delays\nCardiff Airport 'wiped out' by Covid, says boss Meanwhile, ferry passengers have also seen disruption since the Easter holiday period began last weekend, with the no-notice sackings of hundreds of P&O Ferries staff placing pressure on other operators while demand for travel has picked up. Bad weather has exacerbated problems at Dover, where lorry drivers and holiday-makers have been forced to queue for hours in recent days due to traffic around the port. Dover District Council has said it is prepared to declare \"a major incident\" if the disruption continues into the weekend. On Friday, ferry company DFDS reported delays of two hours on its services from Dover to Calais. The company's director of capacity, Chris Parker, told the BBC tourist traffic through Dover was currently \"free-flowing\" but he warned the port would be \"extremely busy\" this weekend. He added that it would take longer to clear the backlog of freight traffic. Richard Ballantyne, chief executive of the British Ports Association, said it would take several days for the disruption to ease. P&O Ferries has said all its Dover-Calais routes will remain suspended this weekend but it is preparing to get its Pride of Kent and Spirit of Britain ships back in action on the route by next week. In a statement, the Port of Dover said it was expecting \"another busy weekend\" as travellers set off for Easter getaways. It advised passengers to allow plenty of time for their journey, check with their operator before travelling and only arrive for their allotted sailing. ",

            "content": "Sainsbury's has said it is raising the pay for some of its London staff following pressure from shareholders. Workers at outer London stores will be paid the same £11.05 hourly rate as inner London colleagues. It means all Sainsbury's shop workers will get the voluntary Real Living Wage, which is higher than the compulsory National Living Wage. It follows Tesco's announcement on Thursday of a pay increase for their staff. In March, Sainsbury's increased its basic rate of pay from £9.50 to £10 an hour for staff across its supermarkets and Argos stores. At the same time, outer London workers' pay climbed to £10.50 an hour but inner London pay climbed to the Real Living Wage rate of £11.05. But last month, a group of major investors called on Sainsbury's to commit to paying all its workers the Real Living Wage. Sainsbury's new pay deal means all its supermarket workers across the country will be paid the relevant Real Living Wage, matching earlier moves by Lidl, Aldi and Marks & Spencer. Simon Roberts, chief executive of Sainsbury's, said the company \"wanted to help colleagues plan and manage the cost of living in the year ahead\". \"We are always looking at what more we can do and have therefore decided to increase pay rates for outer London to £11.05 so that Sainsbury's and Argos retail colleagues are paid the Real Living Wage and London Living Wage from May,\" he added. Although Sainsbury's has boosted pay for its employees, the supermarket has made no commitment relating to the pay of third-party staff, such as cleaners and security guards. Real Living Wage rises to £9.90 an hour\nHow much is the minimum wage? Last year, Morrisons became the first UK supermarket to announce it would pay at least £10 an hour from April 2021 which was quickly followed by its rivals. Lidl is the highest paying supermarket, with wages increasing to £10.10 an hour outside London and to £11.30 within the M25 in March. Ged Futter, analyst for The Retail Mind consultancy and a former buyer at Asda, told the BBC's Today programme that competition between supermarkets had prompted Tesco and Sainsbury's to raise their wages this week - with an \"Aldi match\" being one factor. \"You need to be offering a salary that is the same as your competitors,\" he said. \"What you will see is that those who don't follow suit will find that their colleagues start looking round for other opportunities. \"People will look for where they can get the best working conditions.\" The Real Living Wage is currently £11.05 in London and £9.90 for the rest of the UK. Half of the companies listed on the FTSE 100 share index are among the more than 9,500 accredited Living Wage employers. It is set by the Living Wage Foundation charity and is different to the National Living Wage, which sets out the minimum a worker can be paid per hour by law. The National Living Wage applies to workers over the age of 23, and is currently £9.50 per hour. There is also the National Minimum Wage for those aged 21 to 22, which is currently £9.18. ",

Kinder Happy Moments Chocolate Assortment and Kinder Mix Chocolate Treats basket are being voluntarily recalled, Ferrero North America said. It comes after the firm recalled its Kinder Surprise chocolate eggs from UK stores earlier this week. The company said it made the decision because they were made in a factory where salmonella had been detected. At the time, Ferrero said the affected chocolate was manufactured in Belgium and the recall could be extended to other countries. It emphasised that no other Kinder or Ferrero products sold in the US were affected by this recall. \"Ferrero is cooperating with the US Food and Drug Administration on reported cases of Salmonella in Europe,\" the company said in its latest statement. Some Kinder chocolates have also been recalled in parts of Asia, including Hong Kong and Singapore. Earlier this week, Kinder Surprise chocolate egg products were recalled over a link to salmonella cases in the UK. More Kinder egg chocolates recalled over salmonella\nKinder eggs recalled due to salmonella concerns The UK's Food Standards Agency (FSA) had already advised people not to eat 20g or three-pack eggs with best before dates between 11 July and 7 October 2022. Within days Kinder Easter egg hunt kits (150g), Kinder Mini eggs (75g), Kinder Schokobons (200g) and the 100g Kinder Surprise were also recalled. All the sweets affected were made in the same factory in Belgium. Ferrero, which makes Kinder chocolates, said that it had taken the \"precautionary decision\" to voluntarily extend the recall to these products in the UK and Ireland with best before dates between 20 April 2022 and 21 August 2022. The chocolate-maker said none of its Kinder products released for sale had tested positive for salmonella, but that it takes the matter \"extremely seriously\". The firm added that it was aware of Easter coming up, which usually sees a jump in sales of Kinder Surprise eggs. It came after more than 60 people in the UK, mostly young children, became infected with salmonella in an outbreak linked to the Kinder Surprise treats. On Monday, the FSA said no deaths had been reported in the UK but most cases involved children aged five and under. Investigations so far have been led by the UK Health Security Agency, Public Health Scotland, Public Health Wales and Public Health Agency Northern Ireland. Europe's health agency said on Wednesday it was also looking into dozens of suspected cases of salmonella linked with eating chocolate in at least nine countries including the UK, Germany, France and Belgium. It did not mention Ferrero or any other confectioner in a statement, but warned that the reported cases were mostly among children under 10. The salmonella bacteria can cause serious and severe infections, especially in children or elderly people and others with weak immune systems. ",

            "header": "Firms struggle amid Sri Lanka's economic crisis",
            "content": "It is a daily struggle for Ranjith Koralage, the boss of a Sri Lankan clothing manufacturer, to find enough diesel to run his company's machines and steam rollers. The chief of Kolonna Manufacturing, which is based in Sri Lanka's central province, has been running from station to station looking for 400 litres of fuel for the generator - just enough for one day. With long power outages, interruptions have become the order of the day in factories across Sri Lanka. Thankfully, a generator brings power back up in some factories. But the fix is temporary with limited fuel. Mr Koralage told the BBC: \"Today we survived somehow, but I don't know about tomorrow.\" His export unit makes knitted garments for Victoria's Secret, Puma and Levi's, and is among dozens of clothing factories struggling to meet production targets. Garments are the second largest foreign exchange earner for the Sri Lankan economy. The sector had just recovered from the pandemic, with export earnings increasing by 22.1% to $514m (£393m) in January 2022 compared with a year ago. Kolonna's order book is full for the next three to six months. But now disruptions are adding to existing worries around losing business to rivals in Indonesia, Bangladesh and Vietnam. \"If [the] government doesn't provide fuel we have to stop production, that affects customers' deliveries. Our clients are already asking us daily if we will be able to complete the orders in time or not,\" Mr Koralage says. Sri Lanka president defies calls for his resignation\nSri Lanka central bank to get new head amid crisis Sri Lanka is facing its worst financial crisis in decades, with foreign exchange reserves shrinking by more than 16% to $1.93bn in March, central bank data showed on Thursday. Kolonna Manufacturing is a prime example of the model of economic development that Sri Lanka wanted: a factory in the island nation's hinterland that creates local jobs. It employs 800 workers, all from the region, including its chief executive Mr Koralage. The unit makes garments for export and generates almost $140,000 a year for the local villages. But it is now stuck in a vicious cycle. The dollar shortage has left the country struggling to pay for imports including food, medicine and fuel. Even Sri Lanka's power plants are struggling to maintain operations. Long, rolling, power cuts are crippling businesses, especially export-oriented ones that are capable of earning the much-needed dollars. Exporters like Kolonna typically lock in orders at fixed prices and have limited capacity to absorb rising costs. While a weaker Sri Lankan rupee benefits exporters, rising costs are draining all positives. This affects both the business and its employees. Mr Koralage says as the cost of living goes up, retaining skilled workers will be another yet challenge. It's not just sewing machines that have to keep running. Workers also need to get to factories, something made more difficult with almost 50% of public transport not operating. In the town of Embilipitiya, some 25km (15.5 miles) from Kolonna Manufacturing, the queues were along although the bus station was less busy than usual. 30-year-old Chathuri Dileeka, who works as an office assistant, had been waiting for over an hour. \"Earlier I used to get a bus in 15 minutes, now I have to wait one to two hours. Sometimes the bus stops midway with no fuel,\" she told the BBC. She has a motorcycle at home for shorter commutes but with petrol pumps running dry, even that now stands idle, she said. A group of drivers waiting for their next customer say the number of journeys they have made on longer routes has fallen by a third. Operators have stopped running buses on some less busy routes in order to ration the available fuel. \"[The] situation was not so bad even during Covid lockdowns. That was a crisis that the entire world faced, but this only we are suffering. I had never imagined a life like this, standing in fuel queues for days,\" a driver who has been been in the job for 20 years told the BBC. He did not want to be named. Transport services had completely stopped last week when the government announced that it was closing down the supply of diesel for two days, due to offloading issues at ports. Container trucks leaving the ports with essentials to be transported to the rest of the country are also waiting in kilometre-long queues for days, exasperating shortages. The beach town of Hikkaduwa, 130km south of Colombo, looks deserted. Once bustling with tourists from Europe and Middle East, the streets are now empty. Nelaka Gunarathne opened his 30-room hotel to guests late last year after a three-year hiatus. After a six months of good business, Mr Gunarathne is faced once again with silent lobbies and empty rooms. Tourists are leaving as hotels like his struggle to provide even the most basic services expected by guests. Power cuts and shortages of essentials have hit hopes of a recovery, even for the tourism sector which is crucial to Sri Lankan economy. The industry collapsed during the pandemic, which was a key reason for the country's depleted foreign exchange reserves. Most mid-sized and small-sized firms do not have a generator for back-up electricity as the country has not faced major power cuts in the past. As it attempted to stop foreign currency leaving the country, Sri Lanka's government placed import restrictions on certain items. That led to shortages and sudden price rises for essential foodstuffs including milk powder and rice. Headline inflation has risen to more than 17% in recent weeks, while food inflation is above 20%. With even a cooking gas refills uncertain, restaurants are closed and hotels say retaining guests is a challenge. Mr Gunarathne said 80% of his bookings were cancelled between March and April. \"Guests have been calling to ask if the curfew will continue or will they get food? We really don't have answers for anything. When we are ourselves struggling to buy basic needs, how do we promise guests?\" he said. Sri Lanka became a popular tourist destination due to its pristine beaches and rich local culture. But now protests on the streets are casting a shadow over its image as a safe place to go on holiday. The US State Department has raised its threat level and issued a level 3 travel advisory for American citizens against travel to Sri Lanka. India's largest airline Air India has reduced the number of flights to Sri Lanka due to lower demand. What Sri Lanka needs now is economic and political stability to enable its factories to run smoothly and to bring tourists back to its shores. ",

            "header": "Energy strategy: Boris Johnson defends plan amid cost of living crisis",
            "content": "The PM has defended the government's new energy strategy, following criticism it does little to help people struggling with soaring bills. Boris Johnson said it was a \"long-term plan\" focused on energy supply and the government had already introduced other policies to tackle rising energy costs. The strategy, which aims to increase UK energy independence, includes plans to boost nuclear, wind and hydrogen power. But Labour said it was \"too little, too late\" to help with rising costs. And experts called for a bigger focus on energy efficiency and insulation to help bring bills down. Consumers are facing huge increases in energy bills after the Russian invasion of Ukraine pushed gas prices even higher. Speaking at the Hinkley Point C nuclear power plant, Mr Johnson said the strategy was about \"tackling the mistakes of the past and making sure that we are set well for the future\". Citing policies including a £6bn energy efficiency fund and support for heat pumps, he said the government was \"already doing a huge amount to help people with the immediate cost of living and of course we are going to do more\". Will the UK's energy strategy work?\nHow much nuclear power does the UK use? Under the government's new plans, up to 95% of the UK's electricity could come from low-carbon sources by 2030. There is a big focus on offshore wind, with a new target of producing up to 50 gigawatts (GW) of energy from this source by 2030. Officials said this would be more than enough to power every home in the UK. The strategy says the government wants to \"lead the world once again\" in nuclear power, reversing what it describes as \"decades of underinvestment\". A new body called Great British Nuclear will be launched to bolster the UK's nuclear capacity, with the hope that by 2050 up to 24 GW of electricity will come from that source - 25% of the projected electricity demand. The government hopes to deliver up to eight new reactors, built on existing sites, with a new reactor approved each year until 2030. Nuclear - The government plans to reduce the UK's reliance on oil and gas by building as many as eight new nuclear reactors, including two at Sizewell in Suffolk. A new body will oversee the delivery of the new plants.\nWind - The government aims to reform planning laws to speed up approvals for new offshore wind farms. For onshore wind farms it wants to develop partnerships with \"supportive communities\" who want to host turbines in exchange for guaranteed cheaper energy bills.\nHydrogen - Targets for hydrogen production are being doubled to help provide cleaner energy for industry as well as for power, transport and potentially heating.\nSolar - The government will consider reforming rules for installing solar panels on homes and commercial buildings to help increase the current solar capacity by up to five times by 2035.\nOil and gas - A new licensing round for North Sea projects is being launched in the summer on the basis that producing gas in the UK has a lower carbon footprint than doing so abroad.\nHeat pumps - There will be a £30m \"heat pump investment accelerator competition\" to make British heat pumps which reduce demand for gas. Read more about what the strategy says here. For onshore wind, the strategy commits to consulting on developing partnerships with \"a limited number of supportive communities\" who want to host wind turbines in exchange for guaranteed lower energy bills. However, the strategy says there will be no \"wholesale changes\" to current planning regulations for onshore wind. Although it is one of the cheapest forms of energy, new onshore wind projects have been declining since 2015 when the government ended subsidies and introduced stricter planning rules in response to some complaints that wind turbines were an eyesore and noisy. Defending the decision not to prioritise onshore wind, Prime Minister Boris Johnson said the UK already had about 30GW of onshore wind capacity. He added that new sites \"will have a very high bar to clear\". Environmentalists and many energy experts have reacted with disbelief and anger at some of the measures in the strategy. They cannot believe the government has offered no new policies on saving energy by insulating buildings. They say energy efficiency would immediately lower bills and emissions, and is the cheapest way to improve energy security. A Downing Street source said the strategy was now being seen as an energy supply strategy. Campaigners are also furious that ministers have committed to seeking more oil and gas in the North Sea, even though humans have already found enough fossil fuels to wreck the climate. There is a strong welcome, though, for the promise of more energy from wind offshore with speedier planning consent. The same boost has not been offered to onshore wind. The decision to boost nuclear has drawn a mixed reaction. Some environmentalists say it's too dear and too dangerous. They ridicule the idea from some politicians that every city could have its own mini reactor. But other climate campaigners believe nuclear must be part of the energy mix. Labour leader Sir Keir Starmer said the measures announced were not enough to tackle the cost-of-living crisis. \"All we've got today is a cobbled-together list of things that could and should have been done over the last 10 to 12 years and it doesn't even tackle really important things like insulating homes, which could save £400 on everybody's bill,\" he said. The former boss of energy regulator Ofgem, Dermot Nolan, said: \"Most of these decisions will take a long time to have an impact and in the short run we will continue to be dependent on fossil fuels.\" He said the lack of focus on energy efficiency, insulation and improving the quality of people's homes was \"an opportunity missed\". Asked in the Lords why the government was not spending more on improving the insulation of homes, a business minister suggested the Treasury was not willing to support this. Lord Callanan told peers: \"We're spending something like £6.6bn over the term of this Parliament on insulation schemes. It would have been good to go further but the Treasury wouldn't support it.\" Green Party co-leader Adrian Ramsay said if the government was \"concerned about energy bills and taking real climate action, it would be going even further on onshore wind\". Liberal Democrat leader Sir Ed Davey described the plans as \"utterly hopeless\", while the SNP's Stephen Flynn also called it a \"missed opportunity\". Dr Simon Cran-McGreehin, from the Energy and Climate Intelligence Unit, said the strategy was \"underwhelming\", describing the lack of funding to improve energy efficiency in homes as \"an enormous gaping hole\". He added that there appeared to be \"limited ambition\" for onshore wind, despite it being \"remarkably popular\". ",

            "header": "Tesco staff to see pay rise to £10.10 an hour",
            "content": "Tesco staff are set to see pay rise to £10.10 an hour from the end of July, the supermarket giant has announced. The UK's biggest private employer said staff wages will rise by 55p, up from £9.55 an hour, from 24 July. Meanwhile, its delivery drivers and click and collect assistants will get a 90p increase to £11 an hour. Tesco's move brings it in line with Lidl and Aldi, which became the UK's highest-paying supermarkets this year with the same hourly rate. Union Usdaw said Tesco's pay rise was \"testament\" to the hard work of staff at what it said was a \"difficult time\". The new pay deal will be handed to workers in stores and customer fulfilment centres. Last year, Morrisons became the first UK supermarket to announce it would pay at least £10 an hour from April 2021. Sainsbury's said in January it would pay shop workers at least £10 an hour, while the supermarket is expected to make a further announcement tomorrow on wages. Jason Tarry, chief executive officer of Tesco UK & ROI, said employees were getting a \"well-deserved pay rise, more access to extra hours, and setting out a long-term commitment and investment in their careers at Tesco\". Tesco store workers in London will get a similar increase bring their hourly pay to £10.78 per hour. Alongside pay rises, Tesco is to increase its \"colleague clubcard\" discount allowance by £500 to take the annual total allowance for all colleagues to £1,500 with immediate effect. Usdaw national officer Daniel Adams said the union was \"pleased\" to secure a pay deal that not only delivered \"the highest hourly rate of pay in the sector\", but also gave members a right to request a \"normal hours\" contract and ensured a minimum 16-hour contract in the future. Tesco employs about 300,000 people in the UK, and most of them work on the shop floor. Upping the core hourly wage by an extra 55p will add £200m to the wage bill. There's a battle to recruit and retain staff in many parts of the economy right now. As Britain's biggest retailer, Tesco needs to stay competitive on pay. It can also afford to do so. Tesco's been doing very well. It has momentum and scale in a sector that's as cut throat as it's ever been. This move also puts pressure on other retailers as they wrestle with soaring cost increases and how much of these they can pass on to consumers. Shop workers face the same cost of living pressures as everyone else and more pay deals are on the cards over the coming months. Earlier on Thursday, telecoms giant BT said it would hand its UK frontline workers a £1,500 pay rise in the company's biggest pay increase for more than 20 years. BT said the increase was \"focused on the lowest paid workers\" including engineers, contact centre staff and retail staff, and would work out as a roughly 8% increase for some. But the offer was rejected by the Communication Workers Union. It tweeted that it had \"no choice now but to immediately prepare for a statutory industrial action ballot\". People in the UK are facing increased pressure from living costs, with inflation rising at its fastest rate for 30 years, driven up by surging fuel, energy and food prices. The National Living Wage, which applies to workers over the age of 23, has increased from £8.91 per hour, to £9.50 per hour from this month. The National Minimum Wage, for those aged 21 to 22, has gone up to £9.18. The rate at which prices rise has been forecast to reach 8.7% in the final three months of 2022. ",

            "content": "The price of the average home in the UK has risen by £43,577 since the start of the first lockdown two years ago, the Halifax has said. The lender, part of Lloyds Banking Group, said the 18.2% rise took the cost of a typical home to £282,753. The race for space from buyers was clear with a 21% rise in the price of detached homes compared with a 11% rise in flat prices over the same period. A lack of homes on the market has helped to push up prices. \"The story behind such strong house price inflation remains unchanged: limited supply and strong demand, despite the prospect of increasing pressure on households' finances,\" said Russell Galley, managing director of Halifax. \"Although there is some recent evidence of more homes coming on to the market, the fundamental issue remains that too many buyers are chasing too few properties.\" Rental costs jump as workers return to the office\nFirst-time buyers rise: 'I couldn't keep paying rent' Prices rose by 11% over the year to March, the Halifax said. Rival lender, the Nationwide, recorded a 14% rise in property values over the same 12 months - the fastest annual growth for 17 years. However, a range of forecasters - including the Office for Budget Responsibility - expect the speed of increase to slow in the next few years. Mr Galley said that in the long term \"we know the performance of the housing market remains inextricably linked to the health of the wider economy\". Tom Bill, head of UK residential research at estate agent Knight Frank, said: \"We are presumably witnessing the current peak of UK house price growth. \"At some point in the near future the cost of living squeeze and rising mortgage rates will pull prices back down to earth. A shortage of property for sale has been instrumental in driving double-digit price growth, which is another situation that can't continue indefinitely.\" Sarah Coles, senior personal finance analyst at Hargreaves Lansdown, said: \"While homeowners might feel better off on paper, for anyone trying to get on to the ladder, or move up it, this is pushing properties even further out of reach.

            "content": "Another day, another rise. Employers and workers have been getting to grips with a contentious increase in National Insurance payments as a new tax year begins. Both businesses and employees are feeling fatigued at the financial stress, with almost everyone seeing their contributions going up. A small business I visited in South Ayrshire told me the NI rise compounded an already troubling time with energy and other costs soaring. Scott Weir is founder and chief executive of Pillow Partners - a short-term lettings agency based in Dundonald, South Ayrshire. He said energy bills for its offices were going to \"at least double\", while employees were \"anxious\" about rising fuel costs. He anticipates payroll costs going up with the rise in National Insurance - a third of his staff are in the higher-rate tax bands - and to help them cope with inflation at more than 6%. \"These small changes make a massive difference when it comes to payroll and additional taxes. We just need to be safe,\" he said. Mr Weir said he had been planning to go from 28 staff members to 50 by the end of the year. National Insurance rise starts to hit payments\nBusinesses face perfect storm as tax rise kicks in\nWhat will April's tax changes cost me? \"We had already started some recruitment and had some really good candidates lined up but some can't come because of the travel costs. \"We are going to recruit at least one person less each month over the next few months. \"We need to look at increasing their wages in line with inflation and the minimum wage is also going up as well - all these things are happening in the same month.\" Employees pay National Insurance on their wages and employers pay extra contributions for staff. Employees, businesses and the self-employed will all pay an extra 1.25p in the pound. In September, the government announced the rise in contributions from 6 April. So now, employees will pay contributions on earnings above £9,880 a year. From July, it will be paid on earnings above £12,570 a year. Taken together, the changes - which affect everyone in the UK - mean that over the next 12 months, anyone earning less than about £34,000 a year will pay less in NI than the previous year, while those earning more than £34,000 will see their payments rise. That will mean some of the lowest paid will see a few hundred pounds back in their pockets. The UK government said the additional money would go into helping health and social care changes in England and that additional cash would flow to Scotland to be spent by Scottish ministers. But there's a growing fear that companies who just about survived the pandemic will end up closing as the cost onslaught continues to pile up. As a business linked to tourism, Mr Weir said it had been \"totally dead\" over the last two years. \"We have been waiting to jump back into action and employed lots of new staff over the last few months but now we can't expand as fast as we could have,\" he said. \"As we came out of lockdown there was a real sense of excitement but now things have started to slow down again and people are being very cautious with their money.\" Jonny Griffen, 31, recently joined Pillow Partners as a community engagement manager. He said it was too early to assess the impact of the change to National Insurance but he was already preparing to make sacrifices. \"When you add it on top of the rising fuel costs, gas and electric, council tax, it is just another added expense, isn't it? All these things are going up at the same time so the biggest challenge is budgeting everything. \"Everyone has a certain standard of living and I wouldn't say mine is particularly glamorous. I don't jet off to exotic countries every month and I am not decked out in the nicest clothes. \"We'll probably be thinking 'do we really need the heating on at this time of night, or at this time of the morning?' Hopefully we get a good summer so people who have to make hard choices are not going to be cold. \"Obviously nobody wants these rises but at the same time there is no denying what has happened in the last two years. \"I don't envy the people who have to make the decisions - it is a difficult one - but was it really necessary right now? I would say probably not.\" ",

            "content": "Oil giant Shell has confirmed it will take a hit of up to $5bn (£3.8bn) from offloading its Russian assets as part of plans to withdraw from the country. The firm has pledged to no longer buy oil, but contracts signed before the invasion of Ukraine will be fulfilled. The costs of Shell no longer doing business in Russia include quitting joint ventures with Gazprom. Shell was criticised when it bought Russian crude oil at a cheap price shortly after the war began. In response to the outrage, the company apologised and pledged to stop buying oil from Russia. The company said it would cost between $4bn and $5bn to cut ties with the country. \"Shell has not renewed longer-term contracts for Russian oil, and will only do so under explicit government direction, but we are legally obliged to take delivery of crude bought under contracts that were signed before the invasion,\" the company said. Shell defends decision to buy Russian crude oil\nShell sorry and pledges to stop buying Russian oil The oil firm added that the state of the global oil markets remained \"volatile\". Brent Crude - the global benchmark for oil prices - was trading at about $100 a barrel early on Thursday, but its price has risen to record levels since the war in the Ukraine. The rise in oil prices is due to Russia being one of the world's largest exporters of the commodity and fears of supplies being disrupted because of the conflict. Though the UK gets very little of its oil from Russia, it has been affected by the global rise in prices, which has seen petrol and diesel prices hit record levels. As part of Shell's withdrawal plans, the company said previously it would offload a 27.5% stake in a Russian liquefied natural gas facility, a 50% stake in an oilfield project in Siberia and an energy joint venture. It will also end its involvement in the Nord Stream 2 pipeline between Russia and Germany, which has been put on hold by ministers in Berlin. ",

            "header": "How much nuclear power does the UK use and is it safe?",
            "content": "The government has announced plans to reduce the UK's reliance on oil and gas by building as many as eight new nuclear reactors, as part of its new energy strategy. The aim is that by 2050, up to 24 gigawatts (GW) of electricity will come from nuclear - 25% of the UK's projected electricity demand. Prime Minister Boris Johnson says expanding the use of nuclear would help cut bills and resist \"bullying\" from Russia, which dominates the European gas market. UK plans eight new nuclear reactors to boost energy\nWill the UK's energy strategy work? To create nuclear power, in non-military reactors, uranium atoms are bombarded by much smaller neutron particles. This causes the atoms to break down and release huge amounts of energy as heat. The heat is then used to boil water, producing steam which drives turbines and generates electricity. This process does not result in greenhouse gas emissions, and requires minimal mining for metals and other resources, but does produce hazardous waste that needs to be stored for a very long time. BBC Bitesize: How is nuclear power generated? There are currently six plants that can supply about 20% of UK electricity demand, with 15% generated in 2020. This amount has declined since the 1990s, with several plants reaching the end of their lives. Most of the existing reactors are due to cease operating and be shut down before 2030. The government says it wants to deliver up to eight new reactors overall, with one being approved each year until 2030. The government has backed the construction of Hinkley C in Somerset, which will be the largest nuclear station in Britain. It has also confirmed advanced plans to approve two new reactors at Sizewell C in Suffolk, during this parliament. Wyfla in Anglesey has also been named as a site for a new nuclear power station in the next parliament. As well as larger nuclear power stations, the government is also supporting Small Modular Reactors (SMRs), which work in the same way as conventional nuclear reactors, but on a smaller scale. The energy strategy says the UK will collaborate countries such as Canada and the United States to accelerate work on advanced nuclear technologies, including both SMRs and Advanced Modular Reactors (AMRs). Nuclear power plants are extremely expensive and complicated to build. Hinkley C - the newest of the UK's planned nuclear power stations - is already expected to be 30% over budget at £22 - £26 bn. The much smaller SMRs would cheaper, at about £2bn - but obviously also generate significantly less power. The government also hopes a new financial funding model could cut the cost of new nuclear projects. But this could mean electricity customers have to pay part of schemes' costs upfront through their energy bills. There is also the question of the price which will be paid for the energy generated by the UK's new nuclear plants. In 2013, the government agreed to pay £92.50 per megawatt hour ( for the electricity produced by Hinkley Point, which would rise with inflation. Although this is considerably below current prices which have soared to £195 per megawatt hour due to the energy crisis, critics argue it is still too much. Over the last five years, the price has been between £25 and £50 per megawatt hour, so if prices return to this bro would make nuclear power expensive. Critics of nuclear power say they take so long to come on stream they will be too late for the UK's emissions targets or to reduce energy prices. In 2016, EDF Energy said construction of Hinkley Point C would take 10 years - last year it said it was on track to open by the end of 2026, although further delays are possible. A new body called Great British Nuclear is now being set up, with the aim of overseeing and speeding up the time it takes to build and make nuclear plants operational. The government also says SMRs are quicker to construct than larger plants due to the smaller parts involved. In mid-2021, 415 civilian nuclear reactors were operating in 33 countries, according to the World Nuclear Industry Status report. Together, the \"big five\" - the US, China, France, Russia, and South Korea - generated 72% of all nuclear electricity in the world in 2020. The industry report says that the nuclear share of the global energy market is steadily declining. But two countries, Belarus and the United Arab Emirates, started their first reactors last year. The International Atomic Energy Agency, part of the United Nations, says nuclear power plants are among \"the safest and most secure facilities in the world\". They are subject to stringent international safety standards. There was widespread alarm in March when a nuclear power station in Ukraine - the largest in Europe - was hit by shelling before being taken over by Russia. And there have been some high-profile accidents, where large amounts of radioactive material were released into the environment. The worst nuclear accident in history resulted from an explosion at the Chernobyl nuclear power plant in 1986. A tsunami caused by an enormous earthquake flooded the Fukushima nuclear plant in Japan in 2011. Even under normal conditions, generating nuclear power produces hazardous radioactive waste, which needs to be safely managed and stored for hundreds of years. But a House of Lords paper from October says the issue of nuclear waste remains \"unresolved in the UK\". It is currently stored in temporary facilities that are not designed for the permanent storage of so-called \"high-level\" radioactive waste. The government's preferred solution is \"geological disposal\" - placing waste deep in a rock formation that would prevent radioactivity from escaping. However, no community has agreed to host such a facility. The road to clean energy\nNuclear power: Are we too anxious about the risks of radiation? Unlike fossil fuels, nuclear power stations do not produce greenhouse gases like carbon dioxide or methane - and 1kg of nuclear fuel produces millions of times more energy than 1kg of coal. But like fossil fuels, nuclear fuels are non-renewable energy resources. Building new nuclear plants of any size also creates emissions - for example, through manufacturing the large amounts of steel and other materials needed. The long-term environmental consequences of dealing with nuclear waste are also unclear.

            "content": "Tourism spending in China plunged during this week's Qingming festival, as the world's second largest economy battles a rise in infections. The amount tourists spent during the key three-day holiday was more than 30% lower than the same time last year, official figures show. It comes as travel restrictions in China continue, and Shanghai and other cities remain locked down. Shanghai is the largest city to go into lockdown to date. The Qingming festival, also known as Tomb Sweeping Day, is usually a time when people visit the graves of family and friends to pay their respects. This would often mean people travelling from their homes to other parts of China, which can provide a boost for consumer spending. The festival took place from Sunday 3 April to Tuesday 5 April this year. Local tourists spent 18.78bn yuan ($2.95bn; £2.26bn) over the three days, according to China's Ministry of Culture and Tourism. That was 30.9% lower than last year. The ministry also said that there were 75.4m domestic trips during the festival, which was more than 26% lower than the same time last year. The economic impact of the Shanghai lockdown\nWhy China is locking down its cities Chinese authorities have extended the lockdown of Shanghai to cover the whole city after a fresh surge in Covid cases. Shanghai reported 19,982 new infections for Wednesday, which was a new daily record. However, the numbers are not high by some international standards. The important financial and manufacturing hub has battled a new wave of coronavirus infections for more than a month. Major businesses, including German carmaker Volkswagen (VW), have scaled back their operations in Shanghai. The motor industry giant partially closed its factory in the Chinese city last week, citing supply shortages. Since then production has been suspended and the plant remains closed. \"Like before the Qingming holiday we will continue to monitor the situation day by day,\" a VW spokesperson said. ",

Luton Borough Council backed the airport's plans for growth in December. The Department for Levelling Up, Housing and Communities (DLUHC) has cited concerns over climate change targets and policies for enhancing the natural environment among its reasons. London Luton Airport said it was \"disappointed by the decision\", but opponents welcomed the intervention. The council, whose company Luton Rising owns the UK's fifth busiest airport, said the government's decision was \"in line with due process\". Luton Borough Council was told in a letter: \"To consider all the relevant aspects of the proposed development, the secretary of state [Michael Gove] has decided to hold a local inquiry.\" Airport plans for 1m more passengers approved\nCouncil loans airport a further £119m\nLuton Airport delays plans for second terminal The plans approved by the council would enable the site to handle 19 million people a year - up from 18 million. Amendments to the current noise contours, which measure how many people are affected by noise from the airport, were also approved by the authority. Responding to the government's decision, a council spokesman said: \"The Secretary of State had already signalled his wish to consider reviewing the application so this development is in line with due process.\" Opponents of the expansion have expressed their joy at the decision to hold an inquiry. Andrew Lambourne, from anti-noise group LADACAN, said it was a \"fantastic decision\". The \"call-in\" of the plans was also supported by Bim Afolami, Conservative MP for Hitchin and Harpenden, who last year said the approval decision \"completely ignores the environmental and cross-boundary impact\". The government has the power to call in planning applications that local authorities approve and make the final decision. This usually happens in cases where the decision may have wider effects beyond the immediate locality or potentially conflict with national policy. In a statement, London Luton Airport Operations, which runs the airport, said it respected the secretary of state's request. \"The government understands that airports are an important enabler of wider economic growth, and for LLA to play its part it's important we can maximise our potential,\" it said. \"Our plan enables us to do that by putting the airport on the best possible footing for a long-term recovery that supports the local economy and the creation of jobs following the worst crisis our industry has ever faced.\" He added: \"This plan is consistent with our commitment to achieving carbon neutrality for our own operations by 2026, and to achieve net zero emissions by 2040.\" Find BBC News: East of England on Facebook, Instagram and Twitter.

London Stansted in Essex is recruiting 800 staff and, although it is not seeing the delays at some of the UK's other terminals, it has asked customers to arrive in \"good time\". A spokesman said \"there may at times be longer queues than they are used to\". A total of 1.3m passengers are expected over the Easter school holidays. Stansted said it expects 240,000 passengers to pass through the terminal on the Easter weekend alone, compared with 8,000 last year, when Covid restrictions were still in force. Steve Griffiths, Stansted's managing director, said: \"I want to reassure people that we are working hard to get back to where we need to be.\" On Tuesday, Karen Smart, the director of Manchester Airports Group (MAG) which owns Stansted, resigned following criticisms of long security queues which led to passengers missing flights at Manchester Airport. Staff illnesses due to Covid, and a shortage of staff after many were laid off in the pandemic, has meant longer queues and cancellations as many airports struggle to recruit. Stansted, which has seen relatively few cancellations, still has a major staff shortfall and needed to fill some 800 job vacancies. The airport began a major recruitment drive in January \"to fill hundreds of roles in our security operation, and partner organisations like airlines, ground handlers and Border Force have also been recruiting\" said Mr Griffiths. Kully Sandhu, director of Aviation Recruitment Network which is leading a recruitment drive at Stansted, said: \"Everyone is after the same candidate, and there is a big shortage of labour.\" \"You've got experienced individuals who used to be working at the airport and who were made redundant when furlough payments ended - [they] are now no longer interested in entering the aviation market,\" he said. Brexit and the loss of European workforce had also affected the shortfall of available staff, he said. Meanwhile, the Emirates airline said it would be resuming flights between Dubai and Stansted, with five a week from 1 August, becoming daily from 1 September.

            "content": "The burden of tax falling on workers and employers has increased as a hotly-debated rise in National Insurance payments takes effect. Employees, businesses and the self-employed will pay an extra 1.25p in the pound. The government says it will spend it on health and social care. Opposition MPs said it exacerbated cost of living pressures, but mitigation will be introduced in July. Experts are urging people to check their status as a new tax year starts. Earnings levels at which people start to pay income tax have been frozen, increasing the chances of employees being dragged into a new band - with a higher rate of tax - if they receive a pay rise. Employees pay National Insurance on their wages, employers pay extra contributions for staff, and the self-employed pay it on their profits. In September, the government announced the rise in contributions from 6 April, in part to help ease the burden on the NHS. It means that, instead of paying National Insurance contributions of 12% on earnings up to £50,270 and 2% on anything above that, employees will now pay 13.25% and 3.25% respectively. The self-employed will see equivalent rates go up from 9% and 2% to 10.25% and 3.25%. Businesses face perfect storm as tax rise kicks in\nWhat will April's tax changes cost me?\nFive reasons why prices and bills are going up\nJavid defends NI tax hike for NHS funding Those of state pension age do not pay the tax at present, and nor do those on very low incomes. After the announcement last year, the plans were met with disapproval from opposition parties and some backbench Conservative MPs who criticised the timing, as many people face sharp rises in energy bills and prices in general. Chancellor Rishi Sunak responded in his Spring Statement with plans to allow workers and the self-employed to earn more before they start making National Insurance payments. This will take effect in July. The National Insurance rise will - ministers like to say - provide a much needed boost to health and social care. They claim it will pay for the care cap and boost NHS capacity to help tackle the backlog in England - it is up to the rest of the UK to decide how they spend the proceeds. But the truth is it will only contribute to that. Rising inflation, staff shortages and ageing equipment and buildings, means the health and care system is going to suck up the £39bn raised over the next three years by the hike and then some more. It is also worth bearing in mind the government had already committed to rises for the NHS up until 2024 under a funding settlement agreed by the May government. This had brought the increases to something close to the 4% health has historically got - although the rising inflation that is being seen will whittle that away from now on. And that came after a decade of the budget rising by little more than 1% - an unprecedented squeeze for the health service. The National Insurance rise is not quite all it seems. From now, employees will pay National Insurance contributions on earnings above £9,880 a year. From July, it will be paid on earnings above £12,570 a year. Taken together, the measures mean that, over the next 12 months, anyone earning less than about £34,000 a year will pay less in National Insurance than they did the previous year, while those earning more will see their payments rise. Had the chancellor stuck with his original plan, then all but the very lowest income workers would have paid more in National Insurance. Many employers will still pay more, and business groups have warned that this may be passed on in higher prices. They also said it would add to the pressures already faced by firms following the withdrawal of Covid support measures. Among those concerned about the bill is Hanna Gentry, an assistant general manager at George's Bistro in Cleckheaton. \"Personally for me if I look at my wage I think it's not too much, but as a business when you have to pay that on everybody's wages, it adds up really, really quickly,\" she said. \"We are going to try and bring in more custom, that's the only way we can do it - in terms of events, new menus, to try and draw customers in.\" Meanwhile James Hipkins, managing director of Emery's Timber and Builders Merchants in Stoke and Telford, told the BBC's Today programme the rise was \"another little extra bit\" to add to the rising cost of materials, fuel and energy. \"My greater concern is, is it the beginning of a perfect storm? By that I just mean all the little snips going up, is it going to start to stifle industry?\" However, Mr Hipkins said society had a \"moral obligation and responsibility to this\" to fund social care services, which he added have been \"overlooked\" for too long. \"We all know it needs sorting out, we all know it needs to be paid for but none of us are particularly keen on paying for it,\" he added. \"At this stage is it seems a bit wishy washy and woolly as it's coming in. I would feel a lot more confident and a lot more happy when I see it as an actual separate levy and it can be identified for where it's supposed to be going.\" The government said it had raised Employment Allowance from £4,000 to £5,000, so smaller firms could claim up to £5,000 off their National Insurance bills. Ministers said it meant 670,000 firms would not pay the tax at all. Overall, the increases in National Insurance for employers and higher-income workers will raise an extra £10.9bn in a year for the government, according to the Institute for Fiscal Studies. Prime Minister Boris Johnson described it as \"necessary, fair and responsible\", adding that it would \"provide the health and care system with the long term funding it needs as we recover from the pandemic\". Next year, the extra tax will be rebranded as the Health and Social Care Levy. Health Minister Sajid Javid said the levy was necessary because it would be \"morally wrong\" to let \"our children pay for our healthcare and our adult social care\". The Labour Leader Keir Starmer has condemned the NI rise saying that the UK now has the highest rate of taxation in 70 years. Calling it the \"wrong tax at the wrong time\" he said: \"In the middle of worst cost of living crisis for decades today the government chooses to increase taxes on working people.\" Liberal Democrat leader Sir Ed Davey said the NI rise \"puts all the burden on working people\". An increase in the tax on dividends is also coming into effect, to add to the funds channelled by the government into the NHS and social care. It has also gone up by 1.25p in the pound. Many private investors hold shares in an Individual Savings Account (Isa) which protects them from tax. However, some business owners pay themselves in dividends and so will face a tax rise. Early last year Mr Sunak said the thresholds at which income tax is paid would be frozen at April 2021 levels for five years (although Scotland has different levels). That means pay rises will push more people into higher tax bands. If a pay rise takes somebody from below £12,570 a year to above, then they will start paying income tax at 20% on the amount above £12,570. A shift in salary from below £50,270 to above means paying the higher rate of 40% on the amount above £50,270. The next threshold is at £150,000, when the additional tax rate of 45% kicks in. Adrian Lowery, personal finance spokesman at investing platform Bestinvest, urged people to check their tax code, which is issued by HM Revenue and Customs and can be found on a pay slip. \"A tax code of 1257L is currently used for most people who have one job or pension. If yours is different, make sure you understand why, so you're not paying too much tax,\" he said. At last month's Spring Statement, Mr Sunak pledged to reduce the basic rate of income tax by 1p in the pound before the end of the Parliament in 2024. For this new tax year, the personal allowance of capital gains tax has also been frozen at £12,300, so this much profit can be realised from assets in a year before tax is paid. The threshold for inheritance tax - a levy on estates when somebody dies - has also been frozen again at £325,000, as it has since 2009. ",

            "content": "\"This is worse than Covid or the 2008 crash. There isn't a day that goes by when you aren't hit with another rising cost.\" Adrian Hanrahan is the managing director of Robinson Brothers - a chemicals manufacturer in the West Midlands - and he says that his confidence and that of his customers is beginning to evaporate. \"I'm usually an optimistic person but that has been zapped. I just got off a call with a customer who wants to hold less stock so that means we are holding back on production and investment ourselves.\" He says the £6bn rise in employers' National Insurance that comes in on Wednesday will add £90,000 to his own 250-person payroll - equivalent to the wages of three graduate chemists - and it couldn't come at a worse time. \"It's another kick in the teeth at a time when everything is going up. We use nickel as a catalyser - that's tripled. Plastics, transport, you name it. The sheer volume of price increases is incredible and we can't pass it all on as my customers - and my customers' customers - can't afford it.\" And yet Adrian said it could have been much worse for his company. \"If we hadn't hedged some of our energy costs we would be looking at £1.75m extra a year in bills and that would have probably finished the company.\" Businesses that haven't bought gas in advance or whose deals are ending are seeing energy cost rises averaging 250% as they are not protected by a price cap. Many have already gone under. The number of company insolvencies in February was 23% higher than the same month last year with county court judgements against firms (an early sign of financial distress) doubling. There is growing concern that thousands more firms who made it through the pandemic will not survive the cost onslaught at the same time as the withdrawal of many Covid support measures. Julie Palmer, partner at insolvency experts Begbies Traynor, said: \"Businesses that have bravely battled through the pandemic could now start to fail as the pressures they face become too much. \"Support from the government such as furlough payments, tax reliefs and a moratorium on landlords being able to evict businesses due to rent arrears are due to expire. It's a perfect storm and there are signs the dam is beginning to break.\" Five reasons why prices and bills are going up\nInflation hits new 30-year high in February So far the government has focused its efforts to cushion the energy blow on consumers. The eyes of company owners now turn hopefully to the government's long awaited energy strategy due to be published on Thursday. It's expected to include new and accelerated investments in nuclear, renewables and UK oil and gas production but that will not provide immediate relief to businesses facing crippling bills. Insiders at the Department for Business pointed towards recent comments from the prime minister in the House of Commons that specific help may be forthcoming for intensive energy users such as steel, ceramics and glass makers. For them and thousands of other manufacturers, chip shops, restaurants, care homes, and pubs who won't qualify for that help - this is a \"cost of doing business\" crisis to rival anything in living memory. The Treasury said nearly half a million UK businesses will benefit from a £1,000 tax cut when it raises the Employment Allowance on Wednesday. It means smaller firms will be able to claim up to £5,000 off their employer National Insurance Contributions (NICs) bills, up from £4,000. Chancellor Rishi Sunak said: \"This tax cut for half a million businesses will help them thrive and grow to help drive our economic recovery. \"It comes on top of a suite of wider tax cuts available to firms, including 50% business rates relief, a record fuel duty cut and the super-deduction, the largest two-year business tax cut in our history.\"  ",

P Nandalal Weerasinghe told the BBC that he will take up the position of the bank's governor on Thursday. It came after the bank's head Ajith Nivard Cabraal offered his resignation on Monday, amid mass protests over rising living costs and power cuts. The bank has also postponed an interest rate decision as policy makers try to stabilise the country's currency. The Central Bank of Sri Lanka has not yet made an official announcement on Mr Weerasinghe's appointment. A spokesman for the bank told the BBC that it is waiting for confirmation from the country's president. Speaking by phone from Australia, Mr Weerasinghe said that he had been offered the role and had accepted it. \"I'll take up the position of the governor of the central bank once I go back to Sri Lanka on the 7th [of April],\" he said. However, he declined to comment on any of his plans for Sri Lanka's crisis-hit economy or when a decision on interest rates would be made. \"I need to go back and see how it goes,\" Mr Weerasinghe said. \"But I've already started work,\" he added. Mr Weerasinghe was the bank's deputy governor from September 2012 and left the role eight years later. He is currently based in Australia, where he works as an independent consultant. Sri Lanka central bank head resigns amid crisis\nSri Lanka government rocked by protests On Monday, the bank's governor, Mr Cabraal announced that he had submitted his resignation after all of the country's cabinet ministers resigned. Angry protesters have also been calling for the country's prime minister and president to step down. The island nation of some 22 million people is suffering from its most serious economic crisis since independence from the UK in 1948. The central bank was due to make an interest rate decision on Tuesday but late on Monday postponed the announcement without giving a new date for the event. Analysts had expected the bank to significantly raise its main interest rate as it attempts to stabilise the Sri Lankan rupee and curb the country's soaring rate of inflation. Murtaza Jafferjee, chair of the Advocata Institute think-tank in Sri Lanka's capital, Colombo, said he expects the rate to be increased by least three percentage points at the bank's next monetary policy meeting. \"We are currently facing a massive crisis of confidence. A new finance minister, central bank governor and secretary to the treasury are welcome,\" Mr Jafferjee told the BBC. \"[But] with the public venting a lot of anger at the president, one is not sure how the new economic team can stabilise the ship if the public's anger is not subdued.\" Demonstrators have taken to the streets of the capital Colombo as homes and businesses have had their electricity cut for up to 13 hours at a time. Sri Lankans are also dealing with shortages and soaring inflation, after the country steeply devalued its currency last month ahead of talks with the International Monetary Fund over a bailout. All 26 of Sri Lanka's ministers have submitted letters of resignation - but not Prime Minister Mahinda Rajapaksa or his brother, President Gotabaya Rajapaksa. ",

It comes as 26 of Sri Lanka's ministers have submitted letters of resignation - but not Prime Minister Mahinda Rajapaksa or his brother, President Gotabaya Rajapaksa. Meanwhile, President Rajapaksa's former attorney and the country's ex-justice minister Ali Sabry, was sworn in as the new finance minister on Monday. The banners, slogans, protests, dissent - all continued in a day of turmoil in the island nation. Even as the Sri Lankan ruling dispensation struggles to find its feet, the resignation of the central bank has added more to uncertain times. Ajith Nivard Cabraal's resignation comes right before a crucial monetary policy meeting where the board, chaired by the central bank governor, was to discuss interest rates to deal with rising inflation. Prices of essentials have sky-rocketed and a tinkering of the interest rate is the need of the hour. Dhananath Fernando, chief operations officer of Colombo-based policy think tank Advocata told me that the political instability in the country will impact the economic situation even more. \"With no decision as yet on who takes over as the next governor, we are looking at uncertainty. And the next governor too will have to start from scratch,\" he said. Protestors in the capital city, mostly young, shouted slogans calling for the resignation of the president and prime minister, bothers Gotabaya Rajyapaksha and Mahindra Rajpakshya. The central bank governor and the current ministry of finance, both crucial arms of the economy, were not seeing eye to eye over how to deal with the economic crisis with Mr Cabraal publicly showing his displeasure over the government's decision to seek the IMF's help in coming out of the economic trap. Priyanga Durusinghe, economics professor at the University of Colombo, told me there is a dire need to increase interest rates, as the banks have already said the rates are unrealistic and they cannot lend at these rates. With a disrupted monetary policy board, the upcoming discussion with the IMF later this month could have repercussions too.

He was previously the bank's 12th governor for almost a decade, from July 2006 to January 2015. During his first term in office Mr Cabraal also helped to more than triple the size of the Sri Lankan economy, according to the bank. With him in charge, the bank said: \"Sri Lanka was able to maintain sound and stable macro-economic fundamentals, with inflation being contained at low levels, and financial system stability being achieved in a time of severe global uncertainties and turmoil\".

The Food Standards Agency (FSA) said all the eggs affected had been made in the same factory in Belgium. It advised people not to eat 20g or three-pack eggs with best before dates between 11 July and 7 October 2022. Chocolate-maker Ferrero said none of its Kinder products released for sale had tested positive for salmonella. \"We take matters of food safety extremely seriously and we sincerely apologise for this matter,\" the firm said. No deaths have been reported but most of the 63 salmonella cases so far are among children aged five and under. More cases have reportedly been recorded in Europe, including Ireland, France, Germany, Sweden and the Netherlands. The FSA said Ferrero was voluntarily recalling the products as a precautionary measure and added it had received no complaints. It said the firm was working closely with food safety authorities to identify the exact cause of the outbreak. Other products manufactured by Kinder are not believed to be affected, the FSA said. The agency said in an alert that investigations by public health bodies \"found a link between reported cases of salmonella poisoning across the UK and a specific product produced by the Ferrero company\". \"We know that these particular products are popular with young children, especially as Easter approaches, so we would urge parents and guardians of children to check if any products already in their home are affected by this recall,\" said Tina Potter, head of incidents at the FSA. Dr Lesley Larkin, of the UK Heath Security Agency, said symptoms of salmonellosis, which can include diarrhoea, stomach cramps, nausea, vomiting and fever, \"typically resolve themselves within a few days\". She said symptoms could be more severe, especially in young children and those with weakened immune systems and anybody with concerns should contact their GP or call NHS 111. Salmonella can be spread from person to person, so Dr Larkin advised anyone with symptoms to wash their hands thoroughly and avoid handling other people's food. ",

            "content": "From Tesla's giga factory to a huge Disney resort, many multinational companies have their Chinese foothold in Shanghai. But in recent days the usually bustling financial centre has been stopped in its tracks after a spike in coronavirus cases. With little notice, officials imposed a lockdown on the city's more than 26m residents. The restrictions, which started as a two-stage lockdown last week, have now been expanded to confine practically all residents to their homes. The latest round of quarantining is China's largest since the coronavirus outbreak was first identified in Wuhan at the end of 2019. This lockdown could turn out to be particularly costly for the world's second largest economy. As well as being a major focus of the financial industry, Shanghai is a hub for semiconductor, electronics and car manufacturing. It is also the world's busiest shipping port. Xu Tianchen, China economist for the Economist Intelligence Unit said short-term supply chain disruptions will have an impact on China's economy as a whole. \"There will also be ripple effects elsewhere because of the interconnectedness between Shanghai and other regions of China, especially the manufacturing hub of the Yangtze River Delta,\" he said. On a more local level, the city known for its high-end storefronts like Gucci and Louis Vuitton has already seen consumer spending slump. Lost business at retailers, hotels, and restaurants could directly cost Shanghai 3.7% of its annual Gross Domestic Product (GDP), according to Mr Xu. GDP is a key measure of the health, or otherwise, of an economy. The Chinese government has set a target for the country's GDP to grow by 5.5% this year. But some analysts have said it will struggle to meet that goal. At the end of last week, data pointed to a slowdown in March for China's manufacturing and services sectors. It came after the technology hub Shenzhen and Jilin in China's industrial north-east last month also faced lockdowns so that officials could conduct mass coronavirus testing and try to curb the spread of the highly transmissible Omnicron variant of Covid-19. Omicron vs Zero-Covid: How long can China hold on?\nThe economic cost of China's zero-Covid policy\nWhy China is locking down its cities \"We have seen PMI data, which shows that both manufacturing and services sectors are actually hit hard. And that has not included the Shanghai lockdown. So I think qualitatively we're seeing more downside pressure for the first and second quarters of GDP data,\" according to Peiqian Liu, China economist for NatWest Markets. PMI data is a summary of market conditions gathered through surveying senior executives in key industries about their expectations for a number of factors including new orders, production and employment. With the number of coronavirus cases rising, there could also be more trouble ahead if there are further lockdowns, especially for small business owners. \"The focus is much more on how employment is going to hold up in a prolonged lockdown or extended period of uncertainties of lockdown due to outbreaks. \"So I think the service sector is not only facing a short-term pressure from a three-week lockdown from Shenzhen or a one-week lockdown from Shanghai, but facing much more pressure from the uncertainty that's going down the road with current set of Covid management policies,\" Ms Liu said. While some companies in Shanghai have decided to close during the lockdown, others in industries like financial services and car manufacturing have implemented so-called \"closed-loop\" systems, according to Ms Liu. Essentially, this means that employees have to live as well as work at their offices or factories. \"Imagine what happened in the Winter Olympics. It was also a closed-loop management, just to ensure that things within the bubble works operationally normal, and that they isolate people from outside or from the rest of China.\" However, Mr Xu points out that it is not a strategy that can be sustained in the long-term. \"There's a concern that if lockdowns become prolonged and disruptions to the transportation to the supply chain persist, businesses will be unable to source supplies. \"So they are having an impact on road transport. The obvious risk is that Shanghai fails to eliminate the current outbreak quickly,\" he said. Even as much of the rest of the world opens borders and eases restrictions, China still looks unlikely to shift away from its strict approach to the coronavirus. \"The policy has been a political source of legitimacy. The low levels of infections and deaths in China are often compared to other countries in the domestic media. As a result, the majority of the population within China still favour the zero-Covid policy, despite the increasing economic costs,\" Mr Xu said. But Ms Liu believes there is a possible silver lining as Beijing has pledged to support the economy to meet its ambitious growth target. \"The government has been responsive with a set of easing policies from both fiscal and monetary front. \"That will hopefully stabilise the domestic growth momentum for this for the time being, and to ensure China's smooth running of the supply chain to minimise the global interruption of supply chain at this short term,\" she said.

            "content": "As businesses emerge from the uncertainties presented by coronavirus lockdowns, many are looking at new ways to address their employees' work-life balance. One such option is the four-day week - and a Derbyshire company says this working pattern has given their employees a new lease of life. \"It's great to have that family time,\" says Laura Clarke. As managing director - at the age of 30 - of Chilwell Products, a manufacturing firm set up by her grandparents and passed on through her parents, who remain as directors - Laura's free time has often felt very work-centred. \"For me, the pressure of being a director has often meant I am never away from my work,\" she says. \"Having another day where the business isn't operational is really lovely. \"It gives me that free time to go and be a 30-year-old girl.\" Laura introduced a four-day week at the Stanton by Dale firm in January, making Friday a permanent day off for staff, who retained full pay. The firm had invested nearly £100,000 in new technology, which had helped drive production. Rather than making even more money, Laura decided to do something different. \"Time is the most valuable commodity in life,\" says Laura, from Beeston, in Nottinghamshire. \"You can spend it but you can't get it back. Being able to give the gift of time is quite special. \"There's a bigger picture than just more profit, more turnover. Those are fantastic things and cash is king in business but you can look to give a bit back. \"After the last two years especially, people are burned out and so we've got to be innovative as we go forward.\" Her decision initially raised a few eyebrows, particularly among the more traditional-minded. \"If Google introduced a four-day week, people would see that as being very natural,\" Laura says. \"But in manufacturing and engineering, people probably don't think of us as being very forward-thinking. \"Some of our customers have their reservations. We work in an industry that maybe doesn't share our view of investing in people and time. \"People have asked me why not make more money. But by investing in staff, people feel better. \"Of course we still face challenges at work - it's not all magic and rainbows. But it alleviates that pressure. When you go down into the factory, there's a bit of a buzz.\" In making her decision, Laura has radicalised her quality time with her own family. \"When we worked a five-day week it wouldn't really be possible for me and my mum to go away at the same time or have a big family holiday,\" she says. \"The extra day means we can do a little bit more - even just a long weekend. \"We've been on days out to Ladybower Reservoir in the Peak District. We were able to go out for a drink for my mum's birthday. \"My mum and I will make time for lunch, just me and her. \"My mum has always wanted to go on a family holiday to Lapland so we are doing that in December, flying out on Thursday and coming out on Sunday. \"People have this struggle of balancing their family and their work life. \"I think it's a monster we have created in society that people are facing these kind of challenges. \"For me, it seems obvious to support people.\" Nick Wall, 28, from Derby, has worked at the business for almost four years as a tool maker as one of the company's nine staff. \"It's a really nice little family business,\" he says. However, he admitted he was taken aback by the move to four-day week working. \"When we first heard about it, we thought 'What's the catch?'\" he says. \"But it's really nice that the company takes care of people's work/ life balance. \"My mates are all jealous and keep asking if they can get a job here because they'd like the hours and that extra day off.\" The business is putting Nick through a qualification at Derby College on Fridays, so he is allowed to take Wednesday off instead. He says he has used the extra day to go on day trips with his partner, as well as enjoy some leisure time. \"It's much better going out during the week when things are not so busy,\" he says. \"I went to the Harry Potter tour with my partner. She's a big Harry Potter fan and it gave us that chance to have a day out. \"I also went to a motorbike show at the NEC. I like to go out on my bike mid-afternoon on a Wednesday, when the roads are clear.\" Nick says he's not sure if four-day weeks would work for every business. \"I think it might be quite hard for a lot of companies. It depends on what they produce,\" he says. \"But it definitely breaks up the week and chills you out a bit more at work.\" As a father of three and grandfather of one, Darren Fox, 47, from Long Eaton in Derbyshire, says he used to feel mentally tired at work. Darren works as a tool maker while his wife Lara works as a microscopist for a scientific company. \"We would have to use up all our holiday on childcare,\" he says. \"I have three kids - the youngest are 11 and 13 - and one grandchild. \"I had always worked five days - sometimes six. \"I spent my weekends taking the kids to football, tidying bits and bobs and doing the shopping as well. It could be teatime on a Saturday before I sat down. \"Now I can get some of those jobs done on a Friday and things feel a bit easier. \"I can go and fetch the kids from school without having to rush around. \"I can drop them off at school on a Friday morning as well and get to spend more time with them. \"I might even get to play a game of golf in the summer - I don't normally have time to do that. \"Having a bit of time on your hands and being able to do things you can't do because you're stuck at work all the time is always better than money. \"It doesn't feel like you're at work all the time now. I'm not so tired.\" Martin McTague, national chair of the Federation of Small Businesses, said: \"When it comes to implementing a four-day week, it's up to individual firms to install working arrangements that work best for them and their staff. \"It may be that some employees want to spread out their work over five days, feeling they would be more productive, while others may prefer to get their work done in fewer working days. Clearly it would not suit all sectors.\" Follow BBC East Midlands on Facebook, Twitter, or Instagram. Send your story ideas to eastmidsnews@bbc.co.uk. ",

            "header": "DIY energy: UK solar inventions could reduce bills",
            "content": "Two new solar products from British companies could cut bills for those who cannot put panels on their roof. Solivus's solar sculpture and Filia's solar blinds could provide households an estimated 10-30% of their electricity. The products use a new flexible thin solar film claimed to be more effective when partially shaded or in low light than traditional silicon panels. Interest in home solar has grown as energy prices have risen by over 50%. Eight years in the making, the barrel-shaped Solivus Arc, the first household product from the Kent-based start-up, can be set up to directly charge an electric car or help power a home. Aiming to supply an average of 1,000 kWh a year in the UK, Solivus will guarantee the £3,500 Arc for 20 years and plans to let buyers pay in instalments. The cost would be the \"equivalent of 21p per kWh - and that will be locked-in for the next 20 years… then, after that, it's free, obviously\". chief executive Jo Parker-Swift said. But unless buyers also invest in battery-management systems to store the solar electricity - typically during the brightest hours of the day - any unused will have to be, at best, sold back to the grid - at a fraction of the savings they would have made using the power themselves. Unlike many other solar products, the Arc is made without using any toxic or rare earth materials. Wrapped in an upgradeable lightweight film, multiple layers capture different parts of the light spectrum. The film, made by German company Heliatek, can also be attached to most roofs, unlike conventional heavier panels, which require supported roofs. And although efficiency today is only about half that of traditional solar panels, Solivus says, the technology has the potential to surpass their efficiency by the end of this decade. Solivus has just finished fitting 606 of them to the roofs of the north and west stands at Northampton Saints' rugby stadium. They will provide about 53,000 kWh per year, at 15.5p per kWh, less than half of most fixed-rate tariffs, it says. Filia founder David Wharton wants the new advances in solar film to give everyone a chance to harvest the Sun's energy. \"To date solar has been just for the rich,\" he said. \"My company's aim is all around the democratisation of solar, so any window can now become a solar panel. \"It means people in flats and apartments can now generate their own energy.\" Mr Wharton has created a new way to attach solar film from a continuous roll securely to external roller blinds - and applied for a patent. Installations begin in Spain shortly and, he says, a London authority is looking to see if they will be suitable for its council flats. The real cost savings come with the price of the film Filia is using, from English company PowerRoll. PowerRoll opened its pilot manufacturing plant in the North East, in February. \"We have created a lightweight photo-voltaic (PV) film at a minimum of 10% efficiency, with a manufactured cost of about £8 per sq m [10 sq ft],\" chief commercial officer Don Scott says. But work remained to be done into how to recycle the traces of lead in the product at the end of its expected 10-year lifecycle. Mr Scott estimates retail prices from partners who use the product to be as low as 10-12p per kWh over 10 years, which, he added, provided a big challenge to existing energy suppliers. These advances in solar film are no longer just offering new products that could help address the climate crisis - they are now potentially helping people save money over the long-term too.

            "content": "P&O Ferries faces a probe into the controversial no-notice sackings of nearly 800 members of staff. The Insolvency Service has launched criminal and civil investigations into the circumstances around the redundancies. In a letter, it said it would consider \"prompt and appropriate action\" if the law was broken. Grant Shapps has also asked the service to consider disqualifying its boss from acting as a company director. The transport secretary made the announcement as part of new pay plans for the ferry industry this week after P&O Ferries sacked 786 employees without notice and replaced with them with agency workers. P&O Ferries said on Friday that all but one of the sacked employees had taken steps to accept the redundancy offer made by the company. One former P&O worker, John Lansdown, told the BBC he did not respond to the company's offer. The company declined to comment on the Insolvency Service's investigation when approached by BBC News. Business Secretary Kwasi Kwarteng tweeted that he and Mr Shapps would follow the new investigations into P&O Ferries closely as they develop. The Insolvency Service has the power to investigate allegations of corporate abuse. The BBC is not responsible for the content of external sites.\nView original tweet on Twitter Mr Shapps said earlier this week that his new package of measures would force P&O Ferries to \"fundamentally rethink\" its decision. He urged ports to block ferries from docking if they do not pay their crew the UK minimum wage, with plans to create new laws. Ferry industry groups, however, hit out at the transport secretary's plans, with the UK Major Ports Group saying they should not have to \"be the police for the labour practices of ferry companies\". Unions also expressed disappointment that the plans did not go far enough for workers who had already lost their jobs. P&O Ferries' boss Peter Hebblethwaite admitted that the firm knowingly broke the law by not consulting with unions and planning to compensate workers instead. The firm said previously that staff would be offered £36.5m in total - with about 40 getting more than £100,000 each. P&O Ferries said some employees were set to get 91 weeks' pay and the chance of new employment, and no employee would receive less than £15,000. Mr Hebblethwaite has insisted that a U-turn on the redundancies would cause the company's total collapse, leading to a loss of an additional 2,200 jobs. He told MSPs this week that P&O had \"painstakingly explored all possible alternatives\", but that it could not expect \"unconditional support\" from parent company DP World for the business without a plan to become viable after making a £100m loss year-on-year. Mr Shapps branded the executive a \"pirate of the sea\", accusing him of \"disgracefully shredding the reputation\" of the company. However, Mr Hebblethwaite said he would not step down. He said he felt compelled \"to discharge my duties for this historical company\" and provide \"the effective operation of the trade routes upon which this country depends\". \"I will therefore continue to do my utmost to ensure that this company has a sustainable business for the future.\" ",

            "header": "Warning of fresh energy bill shock in October as prices rise again",
            "content": "People have been warned to brace for another huge rise in energy bills when the next cap takes effect in October. This could add another £629 a year to a typical bill, on top of Friday's unprecedented £700-a-year rise, says energy consultancy Cornwall Insight. The expected rise in bills just as colder weather kicks in has prompted calls for fresh government support to those struggling to pay. Energy prices have been affected by the Ukraine war and pressure on suppliers. The most up-to-date prediction from Cornwall Insight would, if accurate, push annual energy bills for a household using a typical amount of gas and electricity to up to £2,600 from October. A typical bill is expected to fall back to the current level in summer 2023, although longer-term forecasts are tricky. Bill Bullen, the boss of Utilita, warned that elderly people and children were at serious risk over the next winter because of a lack of heating. \"We are going to see an extra £500 or £600 added to bills in October, and frankly the chancellor's going to have to fund that entirely for low-income households,\" he told the BBC. \"He won't be able to afford to take this problem away for everybody... but for customers who can't respond to that price [increase], that's where the help needs to be targeted.\" The warning comes on top of a huge rise in what energy suppliers can charge customers from Friday. The £693 a year rise in a typical energy bill will affect 18 million households, with 4.5 million customers on prepayment meters facing an even bigger increase of £708 a year. At the same time, a host of bill hikes take effect with council tax, water bills and car tax going up for some on 1 April. Minimum wage rates are rising which, along with some financial support from the government, is partially softening the blow. Why are prices rising so quickly? Prices in general are rising at their fastest rate for 30 years, but the sudden increase in the cost of energy is the most significant for individuals. New official figures suggest four in 10 bill-payers have been finding it very, or somewhat, difficult to afford their energy costs. The governor of the Bank of England, Andrew Bailey, said the country is facing the biggest single shock from energy prices since the 1970s. It is the largest increase, by far, in the energy regulator Ofgem's price cap, since it was introduced. The cap, set every six months for England. Wales and Scotland, is designed to protect domestic customers from the volatility of wholesale energy prices. How we cut back: Skipping meals and fewer car journeys\nMoney saving tips: How to budget as energy bills rise\n'I'm mending my son's shoes, not buying a new pair' Chris O'Shea, chief executive of Centrica, which owns the UK's largest supplier British Gas, said his business was supporting struggling customers and was giving grants to those most in need. \"We would love to do more. The reality is that for a retail energy company, the market has gone through quite a change, and profits have reduced quite substantially,\" he told the BBC's Big Green Money Show. However, he accepted that profits had risen sharply for the heavily taxed exploration arm of the business. The Office for National Statistics said that low earners, renters, parents, people with disabilities, unemployed people and divorcees were least able to afford a bill shock. The government has said it was taking \"decisive action\" to help people with the cost of living, including a £200 reduction to energy bills in October - which needs to be paid back in instalments, and a £150 reduction in council tax bills for 80% of billpayers. Speaking to BBC Breakfast, Sir Keir Starmer, the leader of the Labour party, branded the government's response as \"pathetic\". He accused the government of forcing people to choose between heating their homes or eating. He said that the Labour party would introduce a one-off windfall tax on the profits of oil and gas companies and use the money to help households struggling to cope with rising energy bills. But Chancellor Rishi Sunak told the BBC's Newscast: \"I'm confident in what we've done. I know it's tough for people. We're facing a very difficult situation with the price of things going up and I want to do what we can to ameliorate some of that, but I'm also honest with people that we can't ameliorate all of it, sadly.\" Are you affected by issues covered in this story?

            "content": "Millions of households are facing a £700 a year rise in energy costs, alongside hikes in the cost of council tax, water bills and other utilities. It has led to warnings that many people on lower incomes will be forced to choose between paying for heating, or food. A selection of your questions have been answered by: Kevin Peachey - personal finance correspondent\nNicholas Barrett - Reality Check Why do we pay more using a prepayment meter? - Gary Steventon For the 4.5 million people on prepayment meters, the price of energy has now risen by an average £708 - to £2,017 a year. That compares to an annual rise of £693 - to £1,971 - for those on standard tariffs, paid by direct debit. Energy regulator Ofgem's argument is that there are higher fixed costs associated with running a prepayment meter. Charities and some suppliers have said that these customers are often among the most vulnerable and should be given more help by the government. Prepayment energy customers feeling the strain Who allowed the price cap to increase by so much, especially when the energy companies have made record profits? - Chris Yaxley The price cap, covering England, Wales and Scotland, is set every six months by energy regulator Ofgem. It is designed to reflect the costs faced by suppliers and to prevent profiteering. There has been a huge rise this time, owing to the rising cost energy companies pay for gas. This is now being passed on to customers. How high could my energy bills go? There has been a debate about whether energy companies should be taxed more, with the money raised used to help those struggling with bills. Energy companies argue that their retail arms are making very little, or no, profit. While the energy generation business is having a much better time of it, they argue that they are already heavily taxed. Gas prices do not increase by themselves. What is causing the increase? - John Ashburn There are a host of reasons why the wholesale price of gas - paid by energy companies - has been volatile. At present it is about six times higher than it was a year ago. One reason is the surge in demand for energy, as businesses and economies get going again after the lifting of Covid restrictions. There is also the ongoing issue of a shortage of gas storage across Europe. A further rise in the price cap - predicted to push up the typical household energy bill by another £600 a year - is expected in October. This is mainly because of the potential restriction of Russian gas supplies - linked to the war in Ukraine. While we get very little gas from Russia in the UK, we are affected by the global price of gas. Ukraine war: How reliant is the world on Russia for oil and gas?\nMoney tips: How to cut spending as energy bills rise Can people forced to work from home ask employers to contribute to energy bills? - Andrew Green There is nothing to stop you asking. What response you get from your employer is down to them. Some employers have offered temporary grants and payments, to help their staff pay their energy bills. Unions and employees themselves are likely to point to the rising cost of living - including higher energy bills - to ask for higher salaries. Will giving up Netflix, Amazon Prime, alcohol and mobile phones offset the rising cost? - Leslie Cox The average UK household spends about £916 on alcohol each year. The cheapest Netflix plan costs £84 a year, while Amazon Prime costs £96. Some mobile phone deals exceed £80 a month but, depending on your contract, you may be able to switch to a SIM-only deal for as little as £36 a year. Giving up all of these costs could save between £1,132 and £2,056 a year. A 54% rise in the energy price cap means a household using a typical amount of gas and electricity will now pay £1,971 per year. So, going without could make a difference. But even then, a further rise pushing the annual bill up to £2,600 should be expected in October, analysts have told the BBC. How is the assistance provided going to help pensioners who have been robbed of a triple-lock increase? Dave The triple-lock, a policy used to set the rise in state pensions, was suspended last year because it followed the average rise in wages and would have meant an increase of 8%. At the time that seemed like a big increase, but inflation is now 6.2%. Instead of the state pension going up by 8%, it's going up by 3.1% - based on the rate of inflation in September last year, which is a much smaller pay rise for state pensioners. Changes announced by Chancellor Rishi Sunak in the Spring Statement were mostly aimed at working people who pay National Insurance. There has not been any specific new support for pensioners. What is the triple lock and why has it been 'suspended'? Why have tariffs on 100% renewable electricity gone up? - Karl Oldham Eco providers are still affected by wholesale prices, which are driving bill rises. These providers try to buy in advance from renewable sources, and invest in schemes for renewable generation. But ultimately, at present, they have to source electricity from the National Grid - some of which is generated from gas. As a result, they are not immune to the situation in the wider market, and prices charged by renewable generators have been going up too. ",

The state pension that we're getting at the moment does not cover what I need.\" Prices in general are rising at their fastest rate for 30 years, but the sudden increase in the cost of energy is the most significant for individuals. New official figures suggest four in 10 bill-payers have been finding it very, or somewhat, difficult to afford their energy costs. The governor of the Bank of England, Andrew Bailey, said the country is facing the biggest single shock from energy prices since the 1970s. It is the largest increase, by far, in the energy regulator Ofgem's price cap, since it was introduced. The cap, set every six months for England. Wales and Scotland, is designed to protect domestic customers from the volatility of wholesale energy prices. However, official forecasters and analysts have warned people to be braced for another huge rise in energy bills when the next cap takes effect in October. Wholesale prices have been affected by the war in Ukraine and ongoing pressure on suppliers. This could add another £629 to a typical bill in October, according to the most up-to-date prediction, provided to the BBC from leading energy consultancy firm Cornwall Insight. If this proved to be accurate, then the average bill next winter would be double that of the winter just gone. A typical bill is expected to fall back to the current level in summer 2023, although longer-term forecasts are tricky.

The reality is that for a retail energy company, the market has gone through quite a change, and profits have reduced quite substantially,\" he told the BBC's Big Green Money Show. However, he accepted that profits had risen sharply for the heavily taxed exploration arm of the business. Council taxes and water bills are also going up for many people, added to the rising cost of food and household items. One estimate suggests that a typical consumer is now facing a £73 a month increase in bills, of which about £58 is from rising energy costs. \"The added cost pressures set to come into play in April threatens to obliterate even the most finely tuned budgets.\" said Myron Jobson, senior personal finance analyst at Interactive Investor. The Office for National Statistics said that low earners, renters, parents, people with disabilities, unemployed people and divorcees were least able to afford a bill shock. Even before the latest increases, charity Citizens Advice said that in March, it referred 24,752 people to food banks or to other charitable support, up by 44% compared to the same month last year. The government has said it was taking \"decisive action\" to help people with the cost of living, including a £200 reduction to energy bills in October - which needs to be paid back in instalments, and a £150 reduction in council tax bills for 80% of billpayers. Speaking to BBC Breakfast, Sir Keir Starmer, the leader of the Labour party, branded the government's response as \"pathetic\". He accused the government of forcing people to choose between heating their homes or eating. He said that the Labour party would introduce a one-off windfall tax on the profits of oil and gas companies and use the money to help households struggling to cope with rising energy bills. But Chancellor Rishi Sunak told the BBC's Newscast: \"I'm confident in what we've done. I know it's tough for people. We're facing a very difficult situation with the price of things going up and I want to do what we can to ameliorate some of that, but I'm also honest with people that we can't ameliorate all of it, sadly.\" ",

            "content": "The company that currently runs the National Lottery is taking legal action after losing out on the next licence. Camelot has started legal proceedings against the Gambling Commission after rival Allwyn was selected as the preferred applicant for the lottery's next licence beginning in 2024. Camelot's boss said he believed the regulator had \"got this decision badly wrong\". The Gambling Commission said it had run a \"fair and robust\" competition. The National Lottery is one of the world's largest lotteries and has raised more than £45bn for 660,000 causes across the UK. It has also played a part in funding training and facilities over the past three decades for Great Britain's Olympic and Paralympic athletes. While not being picked as the preferred applicant for the next licence, Camelot was named as the \"reserve applicant\". \"When we received the result, we were shocked by aspects of the decision,\" said Nigel Railton, Camelot's chief executive. He accused the Gambling Commission of failing \"to provide a satisfactory response\" when the move was challenged. \"We are therefore left with no choice but to ask the court to establish what happened,\" he said. Camelot to lose licence to run National Lottery\nComing for Camelot: The battle to land the lottery Allwyn Entertainment Ltd is a UK-based subsidiary of Europe's largest lottery operator Sazka, which is owned by Czech oil and gas tycoon Karel Komarek. It was awarded the next licence, which includes Lotto, Thunderball and EuroMillions games in the UK, last month. Allwyn signalled its intent to run the National Lottery by launching in early 2021. Its advisory board includes former members of the London 2012 Olympics organising committee, Lord Coe and entrepreneur Sir Keith Mills. The Gambling Commission said that the competition it ran was \"fair and robust\". In a statement, it said: \"We regret Camelot's decision to bring legal proceedings following the outcome of a highly successful competition for the fourth National Lottery licence.\" It added it had taken \"every step possible to ensure a level playing field for all interested parties\". Camelot's Nigel Railton cited concerns over the future of the company's 1,000 employees who had \"worked tirelessly\" on the National Lottery since its launch. \"At the very least, they are owed a proper explanation,\" he wrote, calling for \"independent scrutiny\" of the process in the High Court. Last month, Allwyn described the award as a \"fresh start\" for the lottery. \"To the employees of Camelot, you will all be welcome to join us on this exciting new journey for the National Lottery,\" the bid's chairman Sir Keith Mills wrote in March. He assured Camelot employees they would be \"protected in any transfer\". \"We will make sure the National Lottery works for all,\" he said. ",

            "content": "Prices are rising at their fastest rate for 30 years and millions of households are facing the prospect of a soaring energy bill. We asked four experts for their top tips on what people can do to protect their finances and soften the blow of rising bills. A good starting point is to look in-depth at your spending to find out exactly where your money is going, says Bola Sol, author of How to Save It. \"Start by assessing if there is room for negotiation in any of your fixed expenses,\" she says. \"Is there a better and cheaper provider?\" When it comes to variable monthly outgoings decide what should stay and what should go, she says. \"Every budget needs a miscellaneous fund for those expenses you did not see coming,\" she says. \"Have one in for each month.\" \"Look at your calendar at who is celebrating a birthday, baby shower, wedding or occasion this month,\" she says. \"Ask yourself, if you go, how much will it cost you and is it worth going given the current climate?\" She suggests joining supermarket rewards schemes and family deals for streaming services as well as comparing prices online and searching for discount codes. Small cuts in lots of places can be a less painful way to improve your finances, says Myron Jobson, senior personal finance analyst at the investment platform, Interactive Investor. \"While making huge cuts to a few areas of spending could significantly ease the cost of living squeeze on your finances, they could also have an unacceptable knock-on effect on your quality of life and take a heavy toll on mental and emotional health,\" he says. But small changes can add up, he says. \"For example, you do not have to completely forgo your daily coffee purchase, but you can cut back on how often you buy them.\" After over two years of Covid restrictions, many of us are keen to spend money on getting out more, he says. \"Halving the number of jaunts averaging £50 a week in a month, for example, would give you an extra £100 a month which could go towards footing the extra £57.75 a month increase to the average energy bill,\" he says. If you are facing tough times it is important to make sure you are getting all the support you are entitled to, says Kayley Hignell, the head of families, welfare and work at Citizens Advice. You can use the Citizens Advice benefits calculator to work out if here's any help you could be claiming, she says. \"Important benefits to consider might be Personal Independent Payment, if you need extra help for an illness or disability, or universal credit if you are on a low income or unemployed,\" she says. \"Pension Credit, which can top up your income in retirement, is something many people do not know they are entitled to. \"There are also schemes like local council tax reductions and the new Household Support Fund where you will need to speak to your local council about what might be on offer.\" Low-income families might also be able to get help with the costs of sending children to school, including school meals, transport and uniform through your local education authority, she says. Mental health and finances can be intrinsically linked, says Helen Undy, chief executive of the Money and Mental Health Policy Institute. This means money troubles can have a serious impact on our mental wellbeing, and vice versa, she says. \"If you are feeling stressed or worried about your financial situation, it is important to know that you are not alone and there is help out there,\" she says. \"There is no debt problem that is not fixable with the right support. If you're struggling to keep up with bills, there are lots of free debt advice organisations that can help,\" she says. \"Similarly, if your finances are starting to take a toll on your mental health, it's important to seek help.\" She suggests contacting your GP or speaking to a charity like the Samaritans. \"In recent years lots of banks and energy companies have introduced tools to help customers manage their finances so it is worth asking your providers what they can offer,\" she says. These include sending copies of bills and other letters to a nominated person of your choice, so that they can help you make decisions. Some banks now offer a carer's card, which is a debit card for a loved one to use on your behalf for limited purposes such as grocery shopping, she says. ",

            "header": "Pricing in uncertainty as energy bills rise",
            "content": "We've rarely, if ever, had such advance warning of an price inflation shock, and we know another one will also come to household energy bills in September, with a new forecast that it will mean household energy bills doubling in one year and two tranches.\nInflation is ruthlessly invasive when it takes hold, and global economic pressures allied to war in Ukraine make its future path and impact highly uncertain.\nGrowth forecasts for Scotland have been sharply downgraded, as some firms cut back output in response to energy price hikes, while struggling to secure supplies and skilled labour. Price inflation is usually more stealthy. It creeps in, and once established, it's hard to dislodge. It can be ruthless, having the harshest effect on those with least power to increase income to compensate - fixed income pensioners prominent among them. It erodes savings and confidence for investment. The Institute of Directors mark the start of April with an update from the nation's boardrooms, showing a very sharp decline in investment confidence. Price inflation also rips through companies that fail to hedge against it, such as the 28 energy supply companies that collapsed since September. It can spiral, and those of us who remember the 1970s will recall that it can invade the political realm and infect it to its roots. Today marks a surge in price inflation that, unusually, we've seen coming for at least four months. The actual figure for the rise in price cap on domestic energy bills - at 54% - was announced nearly two months ago. Wholesale gas and electricity prices were surging long before the Ukraine war actually began. They were in response to rising tensions on the Russian border with Ukraine, yes, but also to rising global demand coming out of the pandemic, and some sticky supply issues. While there may be hopes of a ceasefire in Ukraine, the economic war between Russia and its energy customers - notably Germany, Poland and Austria, which have begun preparations for supply shortages - is hotting up. The spot price for natural gas has continued at much higher levels than this time last year - very roughly five times higher, as it bounces around in response to Europe's temperature (a cold snap pushes prices up) and the latest economic sabre-rattling from the Kremlin. So we can expect another huge rise, announced this July and implemented at the start of October 2022, reflecting prices we can already see. Cornwall Insights consultancy has made some assumptions, and estimated average dual-fuel prices will rise by more than £600 to £2,599. That would be a doubling of household energy bills in one year and two steps. And while they are forecast to subside thereafter, the modelling suggests they would fall to a point closer to this summer's elevated prices than last summer's. That is only one part of the story of price inflation and earnings erosion. War in Ukraine is pushing up food prices, through lowering grain sales into the world market and as Russia is a big supplier of fertiliser for future crops. Skilled labour shortages, exacerbated by Brexit, push up wages and they can be passed on to prices. A further lockdown in Shanghai is a reminder that even brief disruptions to shipping supply chains can have prolonged and expensive effects on availability of goods. There are tax rises coming too; payroll tax from Tuesday on both employers and employees. The higher threshold announced in Rishi Sunak's Spring Statement and designed to offset the cost for below-average earners does not start until July. VAT on hospitality returns to 20%, having been at 5% and more recently 12.5% to help the sector weather the pandemic. Similar measures on business rates are being phased out. From today, vehicle duty is up, as is passenger departure tax. Council tax rises in most Scottish council areas by 3% and an average 3.5% in England. And while other prices rise, one of the biggest tax increases is through freezing of thresholds, of income tax at its starter rate and for higher bands, also for capital gains and inheritance taxes. To offset this, there are £200 energy bill loans, £150 council tax rebates and hardship grants. Improvements to home energy efficiency see VAT dropped to zero. The minimum wage and national living wages go up. From 11 April, so do welfare benefits and pensions, but only by 3.1% - they are set each year at the inflation rate in the preceding September, and the chancellor claims to have lacked the capacity to alter that. A lesser range of Scottish government welfare payments get a more generous uprating of 6%. The inflation rate for April is expected to be nearing 8%. If economic warfare intensifies, it could hit double figures. And it won't fall quickly. The Office for Budget Responsibility expectation is of inflation averaging 7.4% across the year. And that doesn't include home prices, which continue to rise - according to Nationwide Building Society - by more than 14% for the UK, and 12% for Scotland. That may reflect the distorting effects of inflation, pushing savers to plough their cash into property. And from the Fraser of Allander Institute at Strathclyde University, the quarterly forecast has been sharply cut from 4.7% to 3.5% this year, and a very weak 1.5% in 2023. That foresees a weaker recovery than the rest of the UK, and the gap growing in 2024, with weaker growth still, at 1.4% in Scotland, while the UK is on a course for 21%. It highlights a fifth of firms responding to its surveys saying they are cutting back output due to rising energy bills, and more than half say they are struggling to get either supplies of goods and services, or the skilled labour they need. This represents an almighty reset. Only some will have the leverage, after the short term, to recoup their lost spending power. Those governments and corporates which control energy are seeing their power enhanced, and that ought to include renewables. The exception is Russia, punished for its aggression by its energy customers and cutting itself off from the dominant western economy. The most abundant commodity is uncertainty - about how this period is resolved, and how much damage will be done to household and company finances in the process. Governments, by contrast, can look on the bright side of inflation - the fact that it quickly depletes their piles of debt built up through the financial crunch and pandemic. ",

            "content": "Passengers are being warned of longer than usual queues at airports over Easter due to staff shortages. The Airport Operators Association (AOA) said its members had been trying to hire for new roles following job losses and staff departing to other industries during the coronavirus pandemic. But it warned recruitment problems and Covid-related staff absences could put operations at airports under strain. The AOA represents most UK airports ranging from Heathrow to Edinburgh. Karen Dee, chief executive of the AOA, said at peak time passengers \"may not have the experience they are used to\". She said airports were working hard to recruit more staff in the run-up to the Easter holidays, and were \"working with the UK government to resolve any delays in the necessary checks before staff can start work\". The AOA has asked travellers to arrive early for flights due to longer check-in waits and has also urged people to make sure they have any Covid-related documents needed for their destination. Holiday bookings jumped with trips planned for Easter after UK Covid travel tests were scrapped. However, airports have said they are operating in a very tight labour market and are trying to keep up with rising demands following the sharp drops in people travelling abroad over the past two years. Kevin O'Reilly, of the specialist aviation and airport recruitment company One Resourcing, said finding enough airport ground staff, including cleaners and baggage handlers, was proving very challenging. \"It's always been a tough market to recruit for, but it's become harder this year,\" he said. Mr O'Reilly said there were a number of reasons businesses were struggling to replenish their staffing levels. \"A huge number of people left the aviation industry due to the pandemic and whilst many have come back, many have found alternative positions in other sectors and do not want to risk returning to work in an industry that made them redundant,\" he added. \"Now there's a bounce-back from having no people travelling, to suddenly everyone wanting travel. \"Recruitment at airports doesn't happen overnight, people must go through a thorough security vetting process to get an airside pass.\" He said some other jobs were tempting workers away from the industry, and some EU nationals had left after Brexit. Manchester Airport has already blamed staff shortages on long passenger queues in recent weeks, ahead of the busier Easter break. Its boss admitted further problems were likely as the airport struggled with increasing demand after \"dramatically scaling back\" operations during the pandemic. Earlier this month, Britain's biggest airport Heathrow said peak demand over the summer holidays could reach 85% of pre-pandemic levels. It said it would need to gear up to meet this demand, as airlines, handlers and airports did not currently have the capacity. Heathrow added it was \"particularly concerned over Border Force's ability to scale up\". ",

The platform says it has \"rectified\" accounts which it found to be promoting NFT market speculation, that can help to drive up prices. There are currently no specific regulations against NFTs in China. However, the mining and trading of cryptocurrencies was banned by authorities last year. On Thursday, WeChat responded to local media reports that the accounts had been banned. The platform said it had \"recently standardised and rectified public accounts and small programmes for speculation and secondary sales of digital collections\". It added that this was done \"according to relevant national regulations, in order to prevent the risk of speculation in virtual currency transactions\". Ukraine to sell NFTs to fund war against Russia\nWhat are NFTs and why are some worth millions? Chinese technology giant Tencent, which owns WeChat, declined to comment further when approached by the BBC. The move comes as China's technology industry has come under intense scrutiny by authorities. The sector has seen a large amount of official action against it since last year, including crackdowns on ecommerce firms, online finance services, social media platforms, gaming companies, cloud computing providers, ride-hailing apps and cryptocurrency miners and exchanges. Even after all the measures, the trading of NFTs is still not illegal in China. However, the digital assets are built on technology which is regulated by Beijing. Under the rules, buyers have to purchase NFTs in the local currency, the yuan, rather than cryptocurrencies, which are banned. NFTs have been touted as the digital answer to collectibles. However, they have no tangible form of their own, and experts have warned about risks in the market. Still, the \"one of a kind assets\" have often been sold for thousands - and even millions - of dollars. ",

            "header": "Ukraine war: Russia threatens to stop supplying gas if not paid in roubles",
            "content": "Russia has told \"unfriendly\" foreign countries they must start paying for gas in roubles or it will cut supplies. Vladimir Putin has signed a decree stating buyers \"must open rouble accounts in Russian banks\" from Friday. \"Nobody sells us anything for free, and we are not going to do charity either - that is, existing contracts will be stopped,\" the Russian president said. Mr Putin's demand is being seen as an attempt to boost the rouble, which has been hit by Western sanctions. His decree means foreign buyers of Russian gas would have to open an account at Russia's Gazprombank and transfer euros or US dollars into it. Gazprombank would then convert this into roubles which will then be used to make the payment for gas. Though the order comes into effect for gas exported from Friday onwards, the payments for that gas will not be paid by European buyers until mid-May, Dr Jack Sharples, a research fellow at the Oxford Institute for Energy Studies told the BBC. That suggests there may not be an immediate threat to supplies. Mr Putin said the switch to roubles was meant to strengthen Russia's sovereignty, and it would stick to its obligations on all contracts, if Western nations obliged. Germany said the change announced by Mr Putin amounted to \"blackmail\". Since Russia invaded Ukraine, Western nations have issued economic and trading sanctions on Russia, but the European Union has not placed bans on oil or gas, unlike the US and Canada, as its member nations rely heavily on it. The EU gets about 40% of its gas and 30% of its oil from Russia, and has no easy substitutes if supplies are disrupted. Meanwhile, Russia currently gets €400m (£340m) per day from gas sales to the bloc and it has no way of rerouting this supply to other markets. For the Kremlin this is designed to suggest a dramatic escalation in the economic battle between the West and Russia over the invasion of Ukraine. Vladimir Putin has outlined a pathway for the cutting of gas supplies to Europe if Western customers refuse to pay for supplies in the Russian currency the rouble. However, the market reaction suggests the details of the mechanism mean that, in practice, European customers will just have to change their currency dealers to Gazprombank. That bank has already been left unsanctioned by the EU, for the purpose of continuity of energy trade. As a result, gas prices remain very high, but did not today shoot into the stratosphere. There should be a workaround. As one leading analyst told me, this solution has \"saved face\" for Putin, who can sound tough on domestic TV. Ultimately, as Russian officials have repeatedly said for decades, Russian supply of energy to the West continued uninterrupted even during the height of the Cold War. Ultimately, Russia still needs the money for the gas, and still wants to leave the possibility of a market for its main export once a peace deal is signed. However, it is also true to say that the threat of a cut-off has escalated. EU nations have prepared emergency measures to manage demand, and would be more willing to face that now during spring and summer than winter. The net effect of the mechanism announced is to limit the ability of the West to freeze the revenues they pay to Gazprom, which Putin described as receiving the gas for free. Some Ukrainian officials have suggested such an approach. Oil and gas dollars and euros continue to help the Kremlin resist an otherwise tough set of financial sanctions. Analysts said Russia halting gas flows to EU member countries to \"force the issue\" would mark a \"major escalation not even performed at the height of the Cold War\". \"It would mark another major financial blow to Russia's coffers,\" the analysts at Fitch Solutions added. It is also unclear whether Russia's new payment mechanism for gas would fully ban payments in euros. Western companies and governments have rejected Russia's demands to pay for gas in roubles as a breach of existing contracts, which are set in euros or US dollars. Germany and Austria take step towards gas rationing\nRussia to allow unauthorised imports from West German Chancellor Olaf Scholz said German companies would continue to pay for Russian gas using euros as stipulated in contracts. Nathan Piper, head of oil and gas research at Investec, told the BBC the move by Mr Putin was an attempt to put economic pressure \"back on Europe\" and that more foreign exchange demand for roubles would likely push up the value of the currency. \"However, long term Russia needs to remain a reliable supplier of gas so it is unclear if they would actually restrict gas supply,\" he added. \"That said, even the risk of it is keeping UK/European gas prices at near record highs and six times the 10-year average. This is translating to steep rises in consumers' energy bills.\" Dr Sharples of the Oxford Institute for Energy Studies, said the two sides could adapt and continue their trade uninterrupted, or one or both parties could claim breach of contract and escalate the situation. \"One would hope that even if the situation escalated to a point where one or both parties call for arbitration, that the gas would continue to flow. However, a stoppage cannot be ruled out,\" he said. Germany, which gets about half its gas and a third of its oil from Russia, has urged its citizens and companies to reduce consumption in anticipation of possible shortages. Austria, which imports about 40% of its gas from Russia, is tightening its monitoring of the market. Under an existing gas emergency plan, the \"early warning phase\", which both Germany and Austria have begun, is the first of three steps designed to prepare the country for a potential supply shortage. In its final stage, the governments would bring in gas rationing. Elsewhere, Bulgaria, which gets 90% of its gas via imports from Russian company Gazprom, has opened a tender for underground drilling as part of plans to almost double the country's gas storage capacity and prepare for any supply disruptions. While the UK would not be directly impacted by supply disruption, as it imports less than 5% of its gas from Russia, it would be affected by prices rising in the global markets as demand in Europe increases. The UK government said it was not planning to pay for Russian gas in roubles. ",

            "content": "Energy websites have been crashing as customers rush to submit meter readings ahead of bills rising on Friday. A number of major suppliers said they were working to resolve issues with their websites. Experts have encouraged people to submit readings so their usage is covered by the current cheaper rates. On Friday, the energy price cap - the maximum price suppliers in England, Wales and Scotland can charge households - is being raised. It means the energy bill of a typical household will increase by 54%. Recording a meter reading prevents suppliers estimating usage and potentially charging for energy used before 1 April at the higher rate. How to take a meter reading before Friday’s price rise\nSunak defends response as energy bills soar by £693\nWhy are prices rising so quickly? Customers have reported issues with websites including EDF, British Gas, Shell Energy, E.On, SSE, Scottish Power, So Energy and Octopus Energy. Greg Jackson, chief executive of Octopus Energy, said the company was currently receiving around 40,000 meter readings an hour, whereas a normal day would be a couple of thousand. However, he urged people not to panic about submitting a reading before 1 April. \"I think with most companies, certainly with Octopus, you can give it any time in the next week and... we'll apply it to the day when you took it,\" he told the BBC's World at One programme. Mr Jackson added that he was \"pretty sure that'll apply universally\". Take a photo of the reading alongside something that shows the time and date\nTry submitting it online later when websites may be less busy - some websites allow you to say when you took the reading\nMany suppliers also offer alternative ways of submitting readings, such as automated phone lines and apps\nCustomers with smart meters don't need to worry as readings are automatically sent to their supplier One British Gas customer, Izmir Smajlaj from Streatham, said he had tried for almost two hours to submit a meter reading online. \"Every time it pops up as an error. The system is probably overloaded with people trying to do the same,\" he told the BBC. \"I tried a laptop, phone, my partner's phone. Tried to reach the British Gas helpline for half an hour then gave up [because] I'm at work.\" Graham Ruddock, a retired civil engineer from Bracknell in Berkshire, said he had been trying to log into his account with E.On Next all morning to enter his meter readings. He told the BBC he had been unable to access his account, instead getting a message advising him to try again later because of \"higher than usual levels of traffic\". Graham said his gas and electricity bill was rising from £80 a month to £200 a month from April, adding that energy price rises would be \"the biggest single change in my finances\". In response to one customer who complained they were unable to submit a meter reading online, E.On Next, in a now deleted tweet, blamed consumer expert Martin Lewis for creating \"unprecedented demand bringing down Britain\". Mr Lewis had urged his social media followers to submit meter readings ahead of 1 April when prices will rise. E.On later apologised for the tweet, saying it was \"an ill-considered and off-the-cuff remark made by one of our energy specialists and in no way reflects our position\". \"We can confirm to our customers that any meter readings they take today can be updated to their account online in the coming days,\" a spokeswoman said. Citizens Advice said firms should have been better prepared for a surge of customers submitting readings. The charity's head of energy policy, Gillian Cooper, said the situation was \"frustrating\" for customers worried about how they will cope with rising bills. However, energy companies said they were seeing unprecedented traffic to their websites. A message on the British Gas website said it was facing \"some technical issues we're trying to resolve as quickly as possible\". It said customers could still submit readings, but warned it could take \"a little time to update your account with the meter reading you provided today\". A Scottish Power spokesman said: \"We are aware of an issue some of our customers are facing trying to log their meter readings on our website and are working to have the issue resolved as quickly as possible.\" He added that customers could still log meter readings on the company's app, which was still working. A spokesman for EDF said it was aware of technical issues affecting its website and app when customers tried to submit meter readings. \"We are working hard to try and resolve this and would encourage customers to try again later and apologise for the inconvenience this is causing,\" he said. A spokesman for Shell Energy said: \"Our website is experiencing disruption as we deal with a surge in the number of customers trying to access their account.\" ",

            "header": "House price growth at 17-year high, says Nationwide",
            "content": "House prices grew at the fastest annual pace for more than 17 years in March despite the cost of living crisis, according to Nationwide. Annual growth in house prices hit 14.3% in February, the mortgage lender said, the strongest pace since November 2004. The cost of a typical UK home reached a new record high of £265,312, rising £33,000 in the past year, it said. Prices are being pushed higher by robust demand, limited supply and a strong jobs market, it added. Nationwide, which is one of the UK's biggest mortgage lenders, said the housing market had \"a surprising amount of momentum given the mounting pressure on household budgets and the steady rise in borrowing costs\". Households in the UK are being squeezed by a cost of living crisis, with prices rising at their fastest rate for 30 years as fuel, energy and food costs surge. Mortgage costs are also rising after the Bank of England raised interest rates three times in four months to try to help lower that price inflation. But these factors have not dampened acceleration in house price growth, Nationwide said. House prices are now more than fifth higher than early 2020 when the pandemic hit. Wales, south-west England and East Anglia saw the highest rates of growth, while London - at 7% - had the lowest rate. \"A combination of robust demand and limited stock of homes on the market has kept upward pressure on prices,\" said Robert Gardner, Nationwide's chief economist. The UK labour market is strong - job vacancies hit a record high in October last year - and unemployment has continued to fall, which may have helped the housing market, he said. In addition, some people built up \"significant savings\" during lockdowns, which is \"likely to have helped prospective homebuyers raise a deposit\". Despite these factors, Nationwide expects house price growth to slow in the year ahead, due to high inflation rates and interest rate rises. The Office for Budget Responsibility (OBR), an independent body that makes economic forecasts for the government, predicted in October last year that house prices would fall in 2022. It said last week that people in the UK were facing the biggest drop in living standards on record as wages fail to keep pace with rising prices. Many people took stock of how they lived and worked during Covid lockdowns, leading to a race for space among buyers that was fuelled by a stamp duty holiday. In recent months, there has been a shortage of homes on the market to match demand, which has pushed up asking prices. Gabriella Dickens, senior UK economist at Pantheon Macroeconomics, said that the housing market was going from \"strength to strength\" but that March \"probably marks the peak for house price growth\". \"For starters, mortgage rates look set to rise further in the coming months,\" she said. \"In addition, we expect housing demand to be hit by a sharp drop in households' real disposable incomes.\" The Nationwide's figures came as the Office for National Statistics (ONS) revised up its UK economic growth estimate for the October to December period last year. It estimated that gross domestic product (GDP) grew by 1.3% in the quarter, as opposed to its previous estimate of a 1% increase. As a result, the ONS said the level of GDP was now 0.1% below the pre-Covid period of the final quarter of 2019, compared with its previous estimate of 0.4% below. The ONS figures also indicated that pressures on household finances were leading people to dip into their savings. The household savings ratio dropped to 6.8% in the October-to-December period, down from 7.5% in the previous three months. \"Savings were at their lowest level since the start of the pandemic as household spending rose, mainly driven by rising prices,\" said Darren Morgan, ONS director of economic statistics.

            "content": "Businesses including Volkswagen (VW) have scaled back their operations in Shanghai, which is being locked down due to a surge in Covid-19 infections. The German carmaker partially shuttered its factory in the Chinese city on Thursday, citing supply shortages. More than a dozen companies have suspended plans to list their shares in the major financial centre. Economists are concerned that a slow down in Shanghai could affect growth in the world's second largest economy. On Thursday, official data showed that China's manufacturing and services sectors slowed this month at a faster pace than expected. The National Bureau of Statistics said its purchasing managers' index (PMI) slipped from 50.2 in February to 49.5 in March. A reading below 50 represents contraction on the 100-point scale. PMI data is a summary of market conditions gathered through surveying senior executives in key industries about their expectations for a number of factors including new orders, production and employment. Late on Wednesday, VW said it would partially close its factory in Shanghai due to \"lack [of] parts from suppliers\". The carmaker shut the factory earlier this month, when coronavirus infections were climbing in the city, before restarting production 48 hours later. Earlier this month, a VW spokesperson said \"What we have lost so far in production can be recovered, [for example] via additional shifts, once the situation eases.\" VW did not say how long the latest closure was expected to last, and did not immediately respond to a BBC request for further comment. Its factory in the north eastern city of Changchun has been closed for several weeks. Meanwhile, more than a dozen companies have delayed plans to sell shares on Shanghai's technology-focused STAR Market. The STAR Market has been described as China's answer to New York's Nasdaq trading platform. The plans, which were made public in filings to the stock exchange, affect more than $9bn (£6.9bn) in fundraising, Reuters reported. Panic buying in divided Shanghai under lockdown\nOil prices fall after Shanghai starts lockdown Iris Pang, Greater China chief economist at ING, said the weaker economic data \"reflects the impact of lockdowns for mass Covid testing on production, new orders and delivery times\". \"There is, without doubt, some uncertainty reflected in these numbers - mainly on supply chains,\" she said. \"But we are slightly more optimistic than the market in general.\" However, lockdowns in Shanghai and other Chinese cities may ultimately have \"little impact\" on production, said UBS' chief China economist Tao Wang. She said in a research note that most factories were continuing to operate by keeping workers at the factories or shifting production to unaffected areas. But she added that \"logistics delays and port congestion in Shenzhen may have had some temporary impact on trade, especially China's semiconductor components imports via the Shenzhen-Hong Kong route.\" The lockdown of Shanghai is China's largest since the coronavirus outbreak began. Until now, Chinese authorities had resisted locking down the city of almost 25 million people to avoid destabilising the economy. It has battled a new wave of infections for nearly a month, although case numbers are not high by some international standards. Authorities have locked down the eastern side of Shanghai, which includes the city's financial centre, for Covid testing. The western side of Shanghai is scheduled to go into lockdown on Friday. This staggered approach means that half of the city will be able to remain open. ",

The offer by National Aviation Services (NAS) was made over a month ago, but was still conditional. The board of Menzies, one of Scotland's largest firms, has recommended the bid to shareholders as a \"fair price\". The Edinburgh-based ground services company, formerly bookseller John Menzies, works in 37 countries. NAS is a subsidiary of Kuwait-based logistics conglomerate Agility Public Warehousing which works in Africa, Asia and the Middle East. Menzies said on Wednesday that it had reached an agreement on the terms of the deal with the suitor. The 608p per share deal follows previous bids of 460p, 510p and 605p made in February. John Menzies: From the high street to the skies\nMenzies Aviation faces £560m takeover by rival NAS has expanded across emerging markets in recent years and already owns a 19% stake in Menzies Aviation after purchasing millions of pounds worth of shares earlier this year. Menzies has 25,000 employees in 37 countries, providing passenger, baggage, fuel at airports and aircraft handling services. Menzies chief executive Philipp Joeinig said: \"The Menzies directors believe that the offer represents a fair and recommendable price for shareholders which recognises Menzies' future prospects. \"Menzies is an outstanding business with a long and rich history.\" The company cut more than 17,500 jobs worldwide in March 2020 because of the downturn in air travel due to the pandemic, but remained one of Scotland's biggest businesses. Mr Joeinig said: \"The board of Menzies applauds the work that the Menzies management team have done to steer the business through the challenging impacts of the pandemic and position the business for continued future growth and the next evolution in its journey.\" Agility vice-chairman Tarek Sultan said they were focused on \"growth and shareholder value creation\" and investing in companies in \"high-growth sectors with strong fundamentals, reinforced by management teams with established records\". Menzies started in Edinburgh in 1833 selling Charles Dickens books and The Scotsman newspaper, and became a high street name across the UK. It became one of Britain's biggest newspaper distributors, expanding into air freight from 1987. It sold its distribution arm in 2018. ",

            "content": "Ten million people would struggle to cope in a cashless society even though only 17% of payments are now made with notes and coins, a report has found. Going cashless would make budgeting difficult and would be a \"major inconvenience\" to another 15 million, the Royal Society of Arts (RSA) found. Thousands of bank branches have closed in recent years, and access to cash withdrawals is under threat. The RSA said the \"dash to digital\" held huge risks as finances were stretched. \"For millions of people, their relationship with cash is critical to the way they manage their weekly budget,\" said Mark Hall, author of the report called The Cash Census. \"Despite online banking and shopping becoming more common, our research shows the percentage of the population wholly reliant on cash is unchanged.\" The report said that although millions of people benefitted from the convenience of things like smartphone payments, others felt forced into a world they were not equipped for. Rival banks join forces to protect future of cash\nLloyds Bank to close 60 more branches across UK An estimated 15 million people used cash to budget, the report said, which was all the more important when the cost of living was rising. The constituencies of Liverpool Walton and Bradford South had the smallest decline in cash withdrawals, and were among the most deprived in the UK, it said. Among those keen to keep cash going is Joanne Batty, from Leeds, who said it was still the \"easy and simple\" way to pay and manage finances. \"It is stress and hassle-free,\" she said, explaining that she liked the control you had as a consumer with notes and coins. The 51-year-old said that a \"traumatic\" episode in which she was the victim of fraud meant she was now far more sceptical about online and digital payments. The RSA - or its full name - The Royal Society for the Encouragement of Arts, Manufactures and Commerce - used surveys and interviews during its research. It also suggested that, in contrast to those dependant on cash, there were another 11 million people who were cashless converts. They strongly preferred digital payments and saw no benefit in using cash. They included Craig Purr, a 32-year-old commercial insurance broker, who said that cash was more inconvenient because you usually had to go to an ATM to get hold of it. Mr Purr, from Cambridge, said he carried cards in his wallet instead, or used his smartphone to pay. \"My personal, and selfish, point of view is that we do not need cash. It is out of date because technology is evolving so fast,\" he said. This is the first major study into the topic of cash reliance since the Access to Cash Review in 2019. The author of that 2019 report, Natalie Ceeney, said: \"The question we asked three years ago was whether the UK is ready to go cashless? The answer is still no.\" She told BBC Radio 4's Today programme that digital payments \"just don't work\" for some people, including the 1.5 million who don't have a bank account, and similar numbers without broadband. \"They're increasingly getting marginalised, unable to pay for goods and services, and for many people they could lose their independence, particularly for elderly people, and it can leave people increasingly isolated,\" Ms Ceeney said. Among the recommendations in the latest RSA report were: Legislation to ensure everyone has access to cash near their home\nPayment in cash must be accepted for essential services such as school dinners and council tax bills\nDigital money lessons should be taught from primary school level onwards\nNo region should miss out on the roll-out of broadband Martin McTague, from the Federation of Small Businesses, said: \"One in four small High Street businesses say cash is still the most popular payment method among customers. \"This new report rightly suggests a combination of innovation in the free access to cash space and investment in digital capability as the way forward.\" The closure of thousands of bank branches and ATMs has ignited debate about access to cash, and the ability of small businesses to cash their takings nearby. \"With bank branches closing, the problem facing a retailer is do they shut up shop at lunchtime, go [and] drive somewhere else, stand in a queue to pay-in cash, and go back, or do they go cashless?\" Ms Ceeney said. Major banks recently signed a new voluntary agreement which means an independent assessment of local needs will be carried out each time a branch is shut. These reviews could recommend a shared branch is opened, an ATM installed or a Post Office upgraded. Banks will commit to deliver whatever is recommended. The government is legislating to give the Financial Conduct Authority oversight of access to cash. It has also paved the way for more convenience stores to offer cashback to customers, even if they are not making a purchase. ",

            "content": "The World Bank has suspended four projects in Afghanistan worth $600m (£458m), after the Taliban banned girls from returning to secondary schools. The projects' aims included improving education, health and agriculture. They also had a \"strong focus on ensuring that girls and women participate and benefit from the support,\" the bank had said earlier. Last week, the Taliban reversed a decision to allow the schools to open following months of restrictions. The Taliban said schools would only reopen after a decision over uniforms for female students had been made in accordance with \"Sharia law and Afghan tradition\". The move has drawn international condemnation, while on Saturday protesters gathered close to the Ministry of Education in the country's capital Kabul to demand that the schools be reopened. Protesters urge Taliban to reopen girls' schools\nGirls' tears over chaotic Taliban schools U-turn The World Bank projects were targeted at giving women and girls as much access to services in Afghanistan, as men. They are financed by the Afghanistan Reconstruction Trust Fund (ARTF), which was frozen last year after the Taliban took control of the country. At the start of this month, the executive board of the World Bank approved a plan to use more than $1bn from the fund to support \"urgent needs\" including those in education, agriculture and health. Under the plan, the money would not be handed to Taliban authorities, and was instead to be distributed through United Nations agencies and aid groups. \"As a first step, the ARTF donors will decide on four projects of approximately $600m to support urgent needs in the education, health, and agriculture sectors, as well as community livelihoods,\" the bank said in a statement on 1 March. \"This $600m will be supplemented with additional allocations from the ARTF during 2022 as conditions allow,\" it added. \"This phased approach is designed to be flexible and adaptive, recognising that the situation on the ground remains fluid.\" The BBC understands that the projects will be restarted only when the bank is confident that its goals can be met. On Friday, a joint statement by officials from 10 countries, including the US and UK, described the Taliban's actions as \"profoundly disturbing\". The US State Department has also cancelled meetings with the Taliban, which were scheduled to take place in Qatar. ",

            "content": "Grieving families face extra charges and a \"bureaucratic nightmare\" when informing financial firms of a loved one's death, a consumer group has said. Fairer Finance found some investment companies continued to take fees until an account was closed, which could be months after the death. A trade body admitted there were areas where the sector had \"fallen short\". Nearly half of savings firms required families to call or visit a branch to inform them of a death. Fairer Finance found some investment companies refunded additional fees after a death was reported and others included charges in their headline fees. A small number charged extra fees to pay money out of accounts when somebody died. While terms and conditions make this clear, the consumer group wants a change to the rules. It said investment companies should only be allowed to charge what is needed to cover their own costs, and it also called for a ban on cancellation and account closure fees when somebody died. Tim Fassam, director of policy at PIMFA - the Personal Investment Management and Financial Advice Association, said: \"While we would expect personal investment firms to always seek to deliver superior consumer outcomes to their clients, there are clearly instances as highlighted by this report where they fall short.\" He said that a new consumer duty, outlined by the regulator - the Financial Conduct Authority, should put more emphasis on providing fair value to customers. \"It should, however, be noted that winding up accounts does represent a cost to firms and while the circumstances of that closure are regrettable, it is not unreasonable for firms to seek to recover some of the costs incurred,\" he added. The Fairer Finance report was commissioned by death notification service Life Ledger - a business set up by Ruth Blakemore. She was inspired to do so after the experiences faced by her dad, Ken, and her family following the death of her mum, Pat, in 2016. \"We found Dad crying,\" she said. \"We'd never seen him cry like that before, not even when Mum died. He was surrounded by paperwork and opened up to us with some difficulty about the [previous] couple of days. \"Dad had started the process of notifying relevant organisations of mum's death. He'd got hold of solicitors, and found a copy of her will. Then he tried to contact the building society. This poor old man stood alone in line for quite a while, as it was lunchtime, and when he reached the front of the queue he was told he had to make an appointment to meet in person and he was sent away. \"Then he contacted her pension company. They didn't answer the phone for a while and when they did they gave him a different number to ring - a 'dedicated bereavement helpline'. The helpline was closed for the day. He contacted her mobile phone company. After holding for half an hour he gave up, and that's when we found him.\" The family stepped in to help her father, now aged 91, who she described as a \"straightforward Yorkshireman who takes money matters seriously\". He had been determined to handle his late wife's affairs, but had come up against \"a complex mountain of admin\". In addition to investment accounts, the report suggested there was little incentive for financial services companies to act quickly and efficiently when notified of a death. The consumer group said it cost families millions of pounds a year through ongoing charges for unused services, such as subscriptions, as well as unclaimed savings and pension funds where paperwork and account details had been lost. It described the notification process as \"antiquated and very paper-based\", with many companies requiring families to send an original death certificate. Most had no digital option for reporting a death. This left people having to wait on phone lines or queue in a branch at 22 of 49 savings providers, including High Street banks and building societies, to report the death of a loved one, it said. Funeral firm collapses leaving fears over payments \"Managing a loved one's affairs when they die shouldn't be a bureaucratic and traumatic nightmare. In the 21st century, we should be making better use of technology to simplify the process and to remove some of the burden on families who are grieving,\" said James Daley, managing director of Fairer Finance. He called for the creation of digital death certificates. The Tell Us Once service helps families to inform public services of the death of a loved one with a single notification. The information is shared across HM Revenue and Customs, for tax issues, as well as departments dealing with benefits, state pensions, passports, and driving licences. Some banks are part of a similar scheme, called the Death Notification Service, although the report said that the private sector was more \"fragmented\" in this area. ",

            "content": "Pub and cafe owners at a coastal resort say rental costs for outdoor seating space is set to increase from £100 to several thousand pounds for some. One business in Exmouth, Devon, said the rise in cost to rent a patch of land from East Devon District Council was \"extortionate\". The council said it had subsidised businesses that adjoined the Strand during the Covid-19 lockdown period. However, it added a commercial process was now under way. Olliver Bainbridge from the Grapevine pub said he had been quoted a new rent of £4,500. He said: \"We understand that this is publicly-owned land and we expect to pay for it. \"Our view was something in the five-fold increase in rent would be acceptable, but unfortunately the council has decided to go 45 times the rent, and that's just not ok\". He claimed business owners had spoken to the consultants the council had used and that there was no indication of a possible negotiation. Jacquie Haywood, owner of Fraklin's cafe bar said her rent was going up from £100 to £1,700 which she called \"extortionate\". \"I wouldn't think any business in that hospitality sector could make that work,\" she said. A spokesperson from East Devon District Council said: \"Our request is that the traders interested in a space now engage with the council's agents and we look forward to saying more in the very near future... \"The quoted amounts are professional valuations which we are required by law to obtain. \"The traders have already been told that, and are free to make counter proposals as part of a professional negotiation, as any council or business would expect.\" Follow BBC News South West on Twitter, Facebook and Instagram.

            "header": "Firms must choose between helping Russia and West - US",
            "content": "The world's biggest companies \"have a choice to make\" whether to do business in Russia or in Western allied nations, a top US official has told the BBC. Wally Adeyemo, the US Deputy Treasury Secretary, said firms could \"choose to help Russia\" in its invasion of Ukraine or \"continue to do business with the 30 countries\" that have imposed sanctions. He said Ukraine's allies were committed to issuing more sanctions. He also warned Russian oligarchs \"we're going to come for your resources\". Since Vladimir Putin ordered Russian troops to invade Ukraine, many Western companies have responded by closing down their operations or withdrawing their services from Russia. Sanctions imposed by Western countries have made trading difficult or impossible for some firms, while many others have decided to leave Russian markets for moral reasons. However, some well-known brands, such as Marks & Spencer and Burger King, continue to do business in Russia and have no power to leave due to their brands being run by franchisees in the country. The Western brands unable to leave Russia\nGrowing numbers of firms pull back from Russia\nBP to offload stake in Russian oil firm Rosneft Mr Adeyemo, who is leading the Biden administration's sanction efforts, spoke to the BBC on a visit to Europe to coordinate the next phase of sanctions against Russia. Asked about Chinese and Indian firms filling gaps left by western companies in Russia, Mr Adeyemo said the US would \"take action against\" anyone helping Moscow evade sanctions. \"For these countries, for these companies, for these individuals, they have a choice to make. They can choose to help Russia support their illegal illegitimate invasion of Ukraine, or they can continue to do business with the 30 countries that have joined in taking actions against Russia,\" he said. The US politician said it was clear that the US dollar, euro and pound were the backbone of the global financial system and anyone wanting to work in those currencies had to \"participate in our sanctions\". After an initial slump to record lows, the Russian currency has recovered most of its losses in the aftermath of the invasion. Key to the original drop was the unprecedented sanctioning of Russia's central bank, which limited the ability of President Putin to use its war chest of foreign exchange reserves to defend the currency. However, flows of euros and sterling to fund purchases of Russian oil and gas have continued during the war, helping stabilise the currency. Russia is the European Union's biggest oil trading partner and one of the world's largest oil exporters. Though the US and Canada have banned Russian oil imports, countries in the EU have not, due to being heavily reliant on it. The UK has said it plans to phase out Russian oil by the end of the year. But Mr Adeyemo said the money Russia is \"taking in today is no longer filling in the war chest\". \"They're using that money to buy roubles to prop up their economy,\" he added. The Russian government has ordered exporters to convert any foreign currency they receive into roubles to support the economy, he said. \"That's money they can't use to go and support the war effort,\" he added. \"So ultimately, our goal here is to make sure that we're forcing the Kremlin to make choices between supporting their domestic economy and their domestic needs, rather than being able to support the war.\" Mr Adeyemo reiterated that stopping the war was the aim of Western sanctions, and that \"regime change\" was not a US policy in Russia or anywhere else.

            "content": "Waitrose has sent a legal letter to Asda after its rival unveiled a similarly-named discount product range. Asda announced its Just Essentials range on Monday, promising an expanded line of low-cost products in all its stores from May to help shoppers with the cost of living. But Waitrose said the branding is too similar to its own Essential Waitrose range launched in 2009. Asda said \"essentials\" is a \"commonly-used term\" for discount product ranges. Asda's new value range will replace its current Smart Price range, which was criticised by food poverty campaigner and chef Jack Monroe for not being available in all Asda stores. Waitrose, which is owned by the John Lewis Partnership, said it had written to Asda raising trademark concerns and was awaiting a response. \"We were surprised to hear that Asda is launching an essentials range as the Essential Waitrose brand has been in use since 2009 and has built up a strong reputation for value, quality and higher welfare standards in that time,\" said a Waitrose spokesman. \"As we've also protected the name as a trademark, we have raised this with Asda and are awaiting a response.\" Asda in food promise after Jack Monroe complaints\nInflation hits new 30-year high in February\nWhat is the UK's inflation rate and why is the cost of living going up? An Asda spokesperson said: \"The word 'essentials' is a generic and commonly used term by retailers to describe their value product ranges.\" Asda, which was bought by the billionaire Issa brothers and their backers TDR Capital in 2020, says the Just Essentials by Asda range will include 300 low-cost products. At the moment its value Smart Price and Farm Stores ranges have 200 products. Ms Monroe criticised the supermarket last month for taking value ranges off its shelves and raising prices at time when many household budgets are being squeezed. Following her comments the supermarket chain promised to stock its budget ranges in all 581 supermarkets and online. Mohsin Issa, co-owner of Asda, said: \"We understand that customers are increasingly worried about the cost of living and want help to keep their grocery bills in check, whilst still being able to buy healthy and nutritious food for their families. \"Our new Just Essentials range has been specifically designed with this in mind, combining our lowest prices with a much larger and more diverse range of great value products to meet all household needs.\" The cost of living was rising before Russia's invasion of Ukraine, but the war there has pushed food, fuel and energy bills higher. Catherine Shuttleworth, founder of Savvy Marketing, said Waitrose's actions were likely to have been driven by concern it could lose shoppers to Asda with people shopping around more due to rising prices. \"It's very easy to segregate shoppers on where you think they are likely to shop but there are many more factors - for example it depends where you live and which big stores you have access to. \"Brand matters less and it's more about getting the best price possible,\" she said. Ms Shuttleworth said the difference between supermarket brands was \"very slim\" and Waitrose's move showed how competitive the battle for shoppers had become. However Steve Dresser, chief executive of Grocery Insight, said Waitrose had reduced its presence in the north of England by gradually closing more stores whereas Asda had expanded there. Mr Dresser said that this geographical division meant there would be less crossover in the shoppers that Asda's new range is targeting as there are fewer areas where the two supermarkets are in direct competition. UK inflation hit a new 30-year-high of 6.2% in the 12 months to February, with food prices up 5.1%. And according to research firm Kantar, supermarkets have been passing on their rising costs to consumers. It said the price of a 500g packet of Asda fusilli pasta rose from 45p in September 2021 to 70p in March, up 56%. Two pints of Asda semi-skimmed milk rose from 80p to 95p, a 19% increase. Shoppers are increasingly turning to discounters Aldi and Lidl, Kantar added, with both retailers seeing their share of the grocery market grow in February. On Monday, budget supermarket chain Iceland warned the Ukraine war was pushing up the price of commodities like wheat and could cause shortages of ingredients. Together, Russia and Ukraine make up 30% of global wheat exports. \"Boycotts and disruption resulting from the war are already driving huge increases in global energy and commodity prices, affecting milling wheat, edible oils, animal feed, fertilisers, food processing, packaging and transport,\" managing director Richard Walker wrote in a blog post. \"Our suppliers of meat, poultry, eggs, dairy products and a range of other foods are not just warning us of massive inflationary pressures hurtling towards them: they are seriously worrying about whether they will be able to secure key ingredients at all, or have the diesel to transport them to depots and stores if they do.\" The retailer said it will reverse a decision to stop using palm oil in its own-brand products due to a shortage of sunflower oil caused by the war. Ukraine and Russia account for 70% of the global supply of sunflower oil, but Mr Walker said the ingredient had \"suddenly become totally unobtainable\". ",

            "header": "Full fuel duty cut not being passed on to drivers",
            "content": "Average petrol prices are not fully reflecting a recent cut in fuel tax, according to motoring group the RAC. While fuel duty was cut by 5p per litre last week, petrol has fallen less than 4p, and diesel by less than 3p, it said. Big retailers such as supermarkets and oil giants Shell and BP have already passed on the tax cut. But smaller retailers said last week that it would take time for the fuel duty cut to be passed on. The price of fuel was rising rapidly in the UK even before Russia invaded Ukraine, as economies started to recover from the Covid pandemic. But the war has pushed up crude oil prices, which has fed through to pump prices. The 5p cut in fuel duty announced by Chancellor Rishi Sunak last week is intended to help people struggling with the cost of living crisis - but because prices have risen so quickly, its impact is likely to be minimal, the RAC said at the time. Now, the motoring group says that the cut is not being fully passed on to consumers. How much is fuel duty and what will the cut on petrol save you?\nFuel duty cut by 5p a litre to help motorists Since last Wednesday, the average price for a litre of petrol has fallen by 3.71p to 163.30p per litre, while diesel has fallen 2.79p to 177.11p. RAC spokesman Rod Dennis said: \"Unfortunately, wholesale fuel prices were already rising before the chancellor made his announcement on fuel duty last week. \"This meant retailers were buying fuel in at a higher cost than they were a week earlier, which meant drivers may not have immediately and fully benefitted from the duty cut. \"Wholesale prices are currently falling, but it's likely to be next week before we see what impact this has at the pumps.\" Mr Dennis added that drivers \"remain entirely dependent on what is happening on the wholesale market and the extent to which retailers are able or willing to pass on savings they make\". On Monday, rival motoring group the AA said: \"Why are drivers not surprised that on average a third of the petrol saving has yet to be passed on at the pumps? \"The fuel trade always disputes the accusation that pump prices shoot up like a rocket and fall like a feather. Now we know the truth,\" said Luke Bosdet, the AA's fuel price spokesman. The big four supermarkets - Tesco, Sainsbury's, Asda and Morrisons - have brought in the duty cut in full. Oil giants Shell and BP have also implemented the cut in petrol stations that they own - but many of their branded forecourts are franchised, with prices set by franchisees. Shell owns and operates about half of its 1,000 branded UK stations, while BP owns about 300 of its 1,200 stations. Independent retailers warned last week that it would take time for the fuel duty cut to be reflected in pump prices. Gordon Balmer, executive director of the Petrol Retailers Association, said at the time that petrol stations had bought the fuel they were selling at the higher fuel duty rate. \"As a result, they must first deplete their stocks and resupply with fuel bought at a reduced rate before motorists will see a change in pump prices,\" he said.

            "content": "A second P&O ferry has failed a safety inspection and been detained, the Maritime and Coastguard Agency (MCA) has said. The Pride of Kent is one of eight ships to need inspections before re-entering service, after 800 staff were sacked. The firm replaced staff with agency workers paid less than the minimum wage, but the government says it has prepared measures to block P&O's plans. On Friday, another P&O ferry was held after being declared \"unfit to sail\". The MCA was inspecting the Pride of Kent to make sure it was safe to go to sea without passengers or cargo. A spokesperson for the agency said that the ship had been detained for a mix of reasons including failures on documentation, crew training and emergency equipment not working properly. \"We have advised P&O to invite us back once they have addressed the issues. We do not know yet when this will be,\" they added. P&O Ferries said in a statement that inspections of its ships had reached \"an unprecedent level of rigour\" after interventions by ministers. A spokesperson said that it welcomed the additional scrutiny and it looks forward to welcoming tourists and freight customers back once it's passed all the relevant safety tests. Another P&O Ferries vessel, the European Causeway, failed an MCA Port State Control inspection last week. The ferry was detained in Larne over \"failures on crew familiarisation, vessel documentation and crew training\". Port State Control is the inspection of foreign ships in national ports, to check that the condition of the ship and its equipment comply with the requirements of international rules - including emergency procedures such as firefighting and evacuating the ship. In total, eight P&O Ferries ships need to be inspected on whether or not they are safe to go to sea. The RMT union said: \"It's rare enough for the MCA to impound a ferry but P&O have now had two in a week after the jobs carve-up which speaks volumes about the dire state of their operation\". Transport Secretary Grant Shapps tweeted that \"safety would not be compromised\". The BBC is not responsible for the content of external sites.\nView original tweet on Twitter P&O given deadline to reemploy sacked workers\nProtests at ports against P&O Ferries sackings\nP&O Ferries ship held over crew training concerns P&O Ferries prompted outrage on 17 March when it announced that it would be replacing staff immediately with agency workers paid less than the UK minimum wage. At the weekend, unions held protests at ports in Dover, Hull and Liverpool. On Monday, Mr Shapps said the company's boss had been given \"one final opportunity\" to re-employ sacked staff on their previous salaries. In a letter to Peter Hebblethwaite, he again urged him to reverse his decision to sack 800 seafarers. If not, he said the government's plans to make it illegal for ferry firms to pay less than the minimum wage, would be likely to force him to do so. P&O Ferries initially informed the government its services would be suspended for approximately 7-10 days. Eleven days on from the shock sackings announcement, most of the company's ferries are still going nowhere. The business said at the time it would lose £1m for every day services were not running. After the European Causeway was detained, P&O Ferries said it would make any changes required and continue to work closely with the MCA to return the ship to service. But the failure of two vessels to pass safety inspections must surely cast some doubt on the prospect of currently suspended routes resuming quickly, under their new crewing arrangements. Other ferry operators were ramping up services in anticipation of growing passenger demand for Easter and summer travel, now Covid restrictions have eased. They're taking a lot more bookings than normal, and increasing capacity where possible to try to keep traffic flowing. P&O Ferries said sacking workers was not just about saving money on wages. \"The predicted savings we announced are not solely coming from the reduction in wages, but from removing job duplication and the benefits we will see from increased flexibility,\" it said. It said it would welcome the minimum wage rising for all seafaring workers because it would create \"a level playing field when it comes to pay and conditions on British ferry routes\". Ministers plan to force all ferry companies operating from UK ports to pay at least the national minimum wage, in an attempt to persuade P&O Ferries to reinstate the workers it sacked. The UK minimum wage is £8.91 per hour for workers over 23. The average rate paid to the agency staff brought in by P&O Ferries would be £5.50, which is in line with international maritime standards. Efforts to change the law will begin on Wednesday or Thursday. ",

            "header": "Amazon union election: Will this former worker make history?",
            "content": "When former Amazon worker Chris Smalls organised a small protest outside a massive Amazon warehouse in New York two years ago, he didn't intend to pick a years-long fight with one of the world's largest companies. He just wanted his team to be able to do their jobs safely. \"When the pandemic came, employees underneath me were getting sick,\" he says. \"I realised that something was wrong.\" Amazon fired him, citing quarantine violations. But his concerns caught the world's attention - an early sign of a much bigger labour battle brewing at the e-commerce giant. In the following months, as its business surged thanks to the pandemic, Amazon faced accusations around the world that it neglected staff welfare - claims it denied. In the US, the company now faces its most serious labour unrest in decades. After walkouts and protests across the country, workers at three warehouses in New York and Alabama are deciding whether to join a labour union - which would be a first for Amazon in the US. Mr Smalls is one of the leaders in the fight. Gen Z fights for unions, one Starbucks at a time\nThe battle to halt Amazon's new Africa headquarters\nA sleeping American giant now spoiling for a fight He says he's embracing a role the shopping giant set out in a leaked memo from 2020, which described Mr Smalls as \"not smart or articulate\" and argued that if he became \"the face of the entire union/organising movement\" it would help to undermine it. Mr Smalls, who worked at Amazon for more than four years, starting as an entry-level worker before getting promoted, said he was blindsided by the memo, which some saw as racist, though Amazon told reporters at the time the author wasn't aware Mr Smalls was black. \"My whole life changed in one minute,\" the father-of-two says. \"From there, I started to pretty much try to make them eat their words.\" For 11 months, the 33-year-old and his team have staked out a spot opposite his former workplace, the JFK8 warehouse on Staten Island, intercepting staff on their way home to make the case that they need a union to fight for them in negotiations with the e-commerce giant. His team are seeking higher pay, longer breaks, more paid time off and paid medical leave, among other changes. They want to convince workers that a union will be a more effective way to raise complaints over rules like one that requires staff to work unscheduled overtime shifts. Voting on the question began 25 March and the result will be announced in coming days. Amazon faces a second election at a smaller warehouse in the same industrial park next month. Organisers say the stakes are nothing short of the future of the American worker, pointing to Amazon's rank as the second largest employer in the US. \"We need to take down Amazon. We need these workers to organise,\" says Derrick Palmer, who helped Mr Smalls organise his 2020 protest and was also disciplined (but not fired) by Amazon, which cited social distancing violations. \"We need them to know they have the power.\" Amazon saw off a similar unionisation effort in Alabama last year, convincing workers to vote 2-1 against the idea. The vote - the first the company had faced in the US since it was founded in 1994 - looked decisive. But regulators later called for a re-run, saying Amazon had violated rules that protect the right to organise during the campaign. Officials started counting the results of that vote on 28 March. John Logan, professor of labour and employment studies at San Francisco State University, says it's remarkable that activists have even got to the point of an election, given how much American laws favour employers. Last year, union membership in the US sank again, continuing a decades-long decline despite a surge of activism leading to successful campaigns at Starbucks, media outlets and some smaller retailers. \"Something has definitely changed in the last two years, when it comes to the labour landscape in the United States, and... the Amazon union votes are a reflection of that change,\" Prof Logan says. \"It would be a monumental event if either of the unions [in New York] were to win. But even if they were to lose, if the results are close I still think it will result in more union activity at Amazon warehouses across the country.\" Last year, in the aftermath of the Alabama election, Amazon founder Jeff Bezos pledged that the company would do better by its workers, including addressing the firm's high injury rate. \"Despite what we've accomplished, it's clear to me that we need a better vision for our employees' success,\" he wrote in his final letter to shareholders before stepping down as chief executive. Amazon - which US regulators have accused of retaliating illegally against labour organisers on their staff - remains staunchly anti-union. The firm says it offers competitive pay and benefits and a union will only add a new layer of bureaucracy, while membership fees eat into workers' wages. To fight the campaigns, the firm has inundated staff with texts, fliers and other materials and held repeated mandatory training meetings about the issue, where they cast doubt on the union's ability to secure improvements for its members. \"Our employees have the choice of whether or not to join a union,\" says spokeswoman Kelly Nantel. \"As a company we don't think unions are the best answer for our employees. Our focus remains on working directly with our team to continue making Amazon a great place to work.\" Amazon has been urging workers to vote, warning that if the election is dominated by pro-union forces and the union emerges victorious, it will represent everyone at the warehouses in question. \"Negotiations are always a give and take,\" an Amazon representative warns in audio of a meeting in New York supplied by organisers. \"What's important to the [Amazon Labor Union] may not be important to you. They will be willing to trade your priorities for one of theirs.\" A union victory in New York is far from assured. Leroy Hairston, 22, who has worked at the JFK8 warehouse in New York for about two months - not unusual at a place with high turnover - tells the BBC he is leaning against the union. He thinks it is inexperienced and would struggle to make changes, making resolving staff issues more complicated, \"I don't see the point,\" he says. \"Everything is prolonged instead of just going to HR.\" Mr Smalls says he is hopeful that New York - where one in five workers belong to a union - offers better conditions for victory than Alabama, a notoriously anti-union state. He also has contacts in more than a dozen other warehouses around the country that he hopes to unionise should he prove victorious. \"Once we get established here, we want to spread like wildfire,\" Mr Smalls says. Over the last month, Amazon Labor Union volunteers have made a concerted final push to convince undecided workers. Julian Mitchell-Israel, a 22-year-old community activist who took a job with Amazon to join the union effort, estimates their odds of winning at just over 50%. At a blustery cold rally in the Staten Island industrial park this month, Mr Smalls, in a red hoodie and trainers, seemed undaunted. Surrounded by workers, union activists and politicians he led the small crowd in a chant of: \"We will win! We will win!\" Mickie Garson, 50, who has worked at Amazon for three years and drove in on her day off to hear the union make its pitch, surveyed the scene from the Amazon parking lot, divided from the speakers by several lanes of traffic. She said she remained \"on the fence\" despite experience at previous jobs that made her confident a unionised workplace would be better. \"It's the pressure of knowing that we could make history,\" she says. \"We're excited with the fact that it could happen but also, then what happens after that?\" ",

            "content": "Cadbury has shrunk the size of its Dairy Milk sharing bars by 10%, but will not reduce the price for customers. Parent company Mondelez blamed costs associated with the production of its chocolate spiking, as it reduced the bars' size from 200g to 180g. They are still typically being sold at £2 despite the downsize. US firm Mondelez said the move was the first for that size of Dairy Milk bar in a decade. In 2020, the company was accused of \"shrinkflation\" - reducing the size of a product while keeping the price the same to boost profits. At the time, Cadbury chocolate bars sold in multipacks, including popular treats like Crunchies, Twirls and Wispas, were reduced in size to reduce their calorie count, Mondelez said. The latest move comes as the cost of food is increasing, placing further pressure on UK households during the cost of living crisis. Last week, the rate of inflation (which tracks how the cost of living changes over time) hit a fresh 30-year-high of 6.2% for the year to February. A Mondelez spokesperson said: \"We're facing the same challenges that so many other food companies have already reported when it comes to significantly increased production costs - whether it's ingredients, energy or packaging - and rising inflation. \"This means that our products are much more expensive to make. \"We understand that consumers are faced with rising costs too, which is why we look to absorb costs wherever we can, but, in this difficult environment, we've had to make the decision to slightly reduce the weight of our medium Cadbury Dairy Milk bars for the first time since 2012, so that we can keep them competitive and ensure the great taste and quality our fans enjoy.\" Cadbury accused of 'shrinkflation' as pack size cut\nNestle to sell US confectionery business\nWonka bar and Golden Ticket fetch £15k Separately, the UK's food standards watchdog warned of the sale of counterfeit \"Wonka\" chocolate bars on Monday. The Food Standards Agency (FSA) said the fake products were being sold online and in shops across the UK and might not be safe to eat. It said any Wonka-branded chocolate which does not feature the \"Ferrero\" or \"Ferrara Candy Company\" trademarks on the label was likely to be fake. Some had been found to contain allergens not listed on the label. The warning comes after a sharp increase in reports of counterfeit chocolate bars on sale over the past year. The agency said there was a possibility the fake bars were being produced or repackaged by unregistered businesses and individuals who could be breaking food hygiene, labelling and traceability laws. Tina Potter, Head of Incidents at the FSA, said: \"With Easter less than a month away, it is more important than ever that parents and grandparents are aware of the risks that these bogus chocolate bars could pose to their children, particularly those living with a food allergy or intolerance. \"If you have bought these knock-off bars, do not eat them or give them to friends and family.\" The FSA said it was continuing to investigate further reports with support from local authorities. The Wonka brand was sold by Swiss food giant Nestle to Ferrero Group in 2018, alongside the rest of its US sweets and chocolate business. It is not the first time the brand has been targeted by fraudsters. In 2013 fake Wonka chocolate bars containing bogus \"golden tickets\" were seized by trading standards officers in Suffolk. The product is based on Road Dahl's book Charlie and the Chocolate Factory, which has also inspired two film adaptations. In the book, children who found golden tickets in the bars won a trip to Willy Wonka's chocolate factory. ",

            "header": "P&O Ferries given deadline to reemploy sacked workers",
            "content": "The boss of P&O Ferries has been given \"one final opportunity\" to reemploy sacked staff on their previous salaries by Transport Secretary Grant Shapps. In a letter, Mr Shapps again urged Peter Hebblethwaite to reverse his decision to sack 800 seafarers. If not, he said the government's plans to make it illegal for ferry firms to pay less than the minimum wage, would likely force him to do so. P&O Ferries said sacking workers was not just about saving money on wages. \"The predicted savings we announced are not solely coming from the reduction in wages, but from removing job duplication and the benefits we will see from increased flexibility,\" it said. It said it would welcome the minimum wage rising for all seafaring workers because it would create \"a level playing field when it comes to pay and conditions on British ferry routes.\" P&O Ferries prompted outrage on 17 March when it announced that it would be replacing staff immediately with agency workers paid less than the minimum wage. \"A reversal at this point may also go some way in starting to repair your firm's reputation,\" the transport secretary wrote, accusing Mr Hebblethwaite of leaving it in \"tatters\". Mr Shapps also suggested that company dropped a 31 March deadline given to staff to respond to redundancy offers. It is understood that over half of the sacked workers - 430 people in total - have already accepted their redundancy payments. Mr Hebblethwaite admitted last week that his decision to sack 800 workers without consulting unions first broke the law. However, he said no union would have accepted the plan and it was easier to compensate workers \"in full\" instead. The transport secretary said Mr Hebblethwaite's attitude showed \"contempt for workers who have given years of service at your company\". The BBC is not responsible for the content of external sites.\nView original tweet on Twitter Ministers plan to force all ferry companies operating from UK ports to pay at least the National Minimum Wage, in a bid to persuade P&O Ferries to reinstate 800 workers it has sacked. The UK minimum wage is £8.91 per hour for workers over 23. The average rate paid to the agency staff brought in by P&O Ferries would be £5.50, which is in line with international maritime standards. Efforts to change the law will begin on Wednesday or Thursday. Transport Minister Robert Courts told MPs P&O Ferries would \"not be allowed to get away with their actions\". He said that the government was looking at a range of tools \"as fast as humanly possible\", although he could not give more detail when speaking in the House of Commons. Mr Shapps said the measures would ensure seafarers were protected against the actions P&O Ferries had taken, but admitted some may not want their jobs back at this stage. The chairs of the Business and Transport committees also wrote to Grant Shapps on Monday, calling on the government to prioritise the well-being of seafarers. \"Government has not moved quickly enough to support them,\" they suggested, while also calling for the resignation of Mr Hebblethwaite. Are the P&O Ferries sackings legal?\nP&O Ferries security ‘treated staff like criminals’\nWhat are my rights if I am made redundant? Unions have also argued that workers should be reinstated on their existing terms - not the National Minimum Wage. The Rail, Maritime and Transport Workers Union said it would not accept the National Minimum Wage for its members, and that P&O Ferries should honour their existing contracts of employment. The union's national secretary, Darren Proctor, said ferry operators paying below minimum wage had \"contributed to the decimation of UK seafarers\" and higher wages would create more opportunities for UK workers. However, he told BBC Radio 4's Today programme customers may have to pay higher prices as a result. \"If you want decent terms and conditions and decent service and safe vessels then you might have to pay a little bit more,\" he said. Unions have also cited fears over a lack of training of new crew, and on Friday the Maritime and Coastguard Agency (MCA) detained P&O Ferries' vessel European Causeway in Northern Ireland. The ship was held in Larne over \"failures on crew familiarisation, vessel documentation and crew training\", the MCA said. P&O Ferries said it would make changes to return the ship to service. Officials will also meet P&O Ferries' rivals to prevent possible Easter travel issues. Bosses from ferry operators DFDS and Stena Lines will meet the government to see what measures can be introduced to help if P&O Ferries services remain disrupted into the Easter holidays. On Monday, P&O Ferries said its Dover-Calais route would remain suspended until 31 March. Sailings were originally expected to resume on 29 March. The firm said it had to replace crews because it was losing £100m a year and would not be a viable business without making the changes. Other operators, such as Eurotunnel, have said they have seen a boost in demand following the move. A Eurotunnel spokesman told the BBC that it had seen a marked increase in bookings since the no-notice sackings - even beyond the boost seen after Covid restrictions were lifted. The firm said it was partly down to people wanting to travel, but also down to consumers voting with their feet after the shock announcement by P&O Ferries. A Department for Transport spokesperson said: \"Ministers are working to understand how we can ensure the continuation of services in collaboration with other operators, including DFDS and Stena\", although Eurotunnel is not expected to take part in the talks.

            "header": "Shanghai Covid: Oil prices fall after city starts lockdown",
            "content": "Global oil prices have fallen as China starts to implement a city-wide lockdown in Shanghai, an important financial and manufacturing hub. Brent crude lost more than $4.50 a barrel on concerns that the move would mean that demand for oil will fall. The Shanghai Composite stock index fell in early trade before regaining most of the losses later in the day. The lockdown, which began on Monday, is China's largest since the coronavirus outbreak began more than two years ago. The futures contract for Brent crude - an international benchmark for oil prices - was down by 4% at $115.80 a barrel. Despite the fall, oil remains almost 80% higher than it was a year ago after the war in Ukraine helped to drive up prices. Traders were concerned about the effectiveness of China's zero-tolerance policy towards Covid, said Stephen Innes, managing partner at SPI Asset Management. Mr Innes also said in a note to investors that there were expectations of further supply chain disruptions as well as a fall in demand. \"We might be only dealing with the tip of the iceberg,\" he said. However, Dan Wang, chief economist at Hang Seng Bank China, does not expect the lockdown to have a major impact on supply chains. Most factories continue to operate as usual, and workers are either being confined on-site or given priority for testing, the Shanghai-based economist told the BBC. \"The suburbs are controlled quite well and quite tightly,\" she said. \"Supply chain stability is a priority in this round.\" She added that, given the spike in Covid cases, there were expectations of more government stimulus and interest rates could be lowered \"quite significantly\" in the coming days. As long as they are passed on by banks, lower interest rates make it less costly for businesses and individuals to borrow money. Meanwhile, the Shanghai Composite stock index opened lower on Monday before regaining those losses to close just 0.07% higher. Until now, Chinese authorities had resisted locking down the city of almost 25 million people to avoid destabilising the world's second largest economy. The city will be locked down in two stages over nine days while authorities carry out Covid-19 testing. The key financial centre has battled a new wave of infections for nearly a month, although case numbers are not high by some international standards. It comes after lockdowns in China affected tens of millions of people across the country earlier this month, including the entire Jilin province and the technology hub of Shenzhen. China announces Shanghai lockdown\nHow is China's zero-Covid strategy changing? Shanghai's public transport has been suspended and firms and factories in the city have been ordered to halt operations or work remotely. The lockdown will take place in two stages, starting on Monday with the eastern side of Shanghai, which includes the city's financial centre. From Friday, the western side of Shanghai is scheduled to go into lockdown. This staggered approach means that half of the city will be able to remain open. Some businesses had already stopped operating in Shanghai, which has been battling a new wave of Covid infections for nearly a month. Last week, the Shanghai Disney Resort said it would close until further notice, citing the \"current pandemic situation\". \"We will continue to monitor the pandemic situation and consult local authorities, and will notify guests as soon as we have a confirmed date to resume operations,\" it said. China's financial capital, home to almost 25m people - Shanghai is now a divided city. Everyone east of its main river is now locked down. Another round of mass testing has started. By the week's end the western half of the city will be shut. Public transport is being closed and the city sealed off. Anyone leaving needs to show a negative test. It is all part of a huge effort to try to stop the spread of a resurgent virus that China's leaders thought they had banished. Anyone testing positive here is sent to hospital or forced quarantine. As the numbers continue to rise China's insistence on a zero-Covid strategy is being tested - but also subtly adapted. ",

            "content": "Sharp rises in standing charges on standard electricity bills will see customers face very different cost increases depending on where they live. Customers in South Scotland, Merseyside, North Wales and the South West of England will see the daily payments double from April. Those in London and the East of England will see increases of less than 60%. All consumer bills include a standing charge; a fixed daily payment covering the costs of supply and other levies. The regulator Ofgem caps them for consumers on standard default tariffs in England, Wales and Scotland, although the cap varies by region. Standing charges are not the biggest part of an energy bill, but they are set to rise by more than £71 a year on average in April. Jeehan Saleh and Hesham Hussain told the BBC the wide regional differences were unfair at time when energy bills are soaring. They say they \"weren't shocked\" when they learned that standing charges where they live in Garston in South Liverpool would rise by double that of other areas. \"Surprise, surprise, Liverpool again isn't it,\" said Hesham. \"It's always us being hit the hardest,\" added Jeehan. \"There's people in poorer areas where we work who are choosing between food bills and energy bills. Thankfully we're not in that position but it's not too far from home. You're already feeling it in so many areas, this is just another hit.\" The standing charge has always varied depending on where you live, due to different costs to supply homes with power in rural or more remote areas. What help with bills is there in my council tax band?\nEnergy bills could reach £3,000 as oil price soars However, BBC research has shown that the increase this spring varies disproportionately in different parts of Britain, when comparing standard variable tariffs for electricity paid for by direct debit. Analysts told the BBC that local suppliers are moving charges which were once part of a consumer's unit price for energy (which now has a tight upper limit on it) over to their standing charge. They are also increasing standing charges to the maximum level for each region, which means a big jump for some places. The average increase - of just under 20p per day - will add more than £71 a year to a standard electricity tariff. But in North Wales and Merseyside, the South West, the Midlands, South Scotland and South Wales the rise will add over £80 a year. In London less than £30 will be added. Price per day for Single Rate Electricity Meter from April 2022 by British region in order of percentage charge.

It comes as households in England, Scotland and Wales prepare for an even bigger hit when the energy price cap - which limits what consumer pay per unit of gas and electricity - also goes up in April. In Liverpool, David and Joan Boyle told us their energy bill was rising by £700. They are happy they will be able to manage but say they worry about other people. Elsewhere there was more concern. \"Standing charges should be the same everywhere shouldn't they,\" said Kev Oloughlin. He was enjoying a day out in the sunshine with his son Leo. He told us they'd \"normally shop around every year when bills come in, but at the moment it's pointless\". He added: \"We're managing alright with things but we're conscious of having the heating and things like that on. Everyone's got to tighten their belt at the minute haven't they.\" The standing charge not only covers costs such network maintenance, administration fees and certain government schemes. It is also the part of your bill that will contribute to the cost of the 28 energy suppliers that have gone bust since last autumn amid a cost crunch sparked by sharply rising wholesale energy prices. Ofgem told the BBC that the levy added to bills to pay for costs associated with energy suppliers going bust had been spread equally across the country. It says standing charges in some regions are increasing more than others because of a reallocation of network costs, the level of which differs between distribution networks. The BBC contacted major suppliers British Gas, Scottish Power, EDF, EOn, Ovo/SSE, Shell, Octopus and Bulb, and almost all confirmed they now have a majority of customers on a standard default tariff, which is controlled by the Ofgem cap. Three of the biggest suppliers, British Gas, Scottish and Ovo/SSE would not give details on their charges, calling them \"commercially sensitive\". But EOn, EDF, Shell, Octopus and Bulb confirmed they were increasing standing charges on these tariffs in line with the standard charge cap, with example prices (including VAT) from Bulb, EDF and Shell varying from 32p a day in London and 38p in the East, to around 50p in Northern Scotland and the South West. And it is not an expense that can be avoided by shopping around. While tariffs actively chosen by customers, such as fixed rate tariffs, are not subject to the default tariff cap on standard charges, there are only a handful of such deals on the market. Moneysupermarket told the BBC that as of 14 March, there were just five fixed tariffs available to consumers. This compares to about 96 fixed deals available at the same time in 2021. Standing charges are certainly not the biggest part of your energy bill, and they are dwarfed by the massive increases in the unit price for the energy you use. But in normal circumstances an extra £80 a year on your energy bill just from standing charges would not go unnoticed, especially as in some areas they are increasing by a lot more than others. So is something fishy going on? Ofgem assures me that the extra costs for failed energy companies are being spread equally across the country. But the Energy Networks Association say that no major network developments have happened in any areas in the last six months that would explain the regional divisions. Local suppliers are moving charges which were once part of your unit price, which now has a tight price cap on it, and shifting them across to your standing charge. Most suppliers are upping their standing charges to the maximum level for each region, which means a big jump for some places, adding insult to the injury of a whopping energy bill.

The European Causeway had been held in Larne over \"failures on crew familiarisation, vessel documentation and crew training\", the Maritime and Coastguard Agency (MCA) said. P&O Ferries said it would make changes to return the ship to service. Protests at UK ports are calling on customers to boycott the company. They gathered in Dover, Hull and Liverpool, chanting slogans such as \"don't go P&O\" and \"seize the ship\". Protestors from the RMT Union are attempting to block access to the Pride of Rotterdam in Hull docks. Meanwhile, the Trades Union Congress tweeted a video it said showed P&O dockers in Rotterdam refusing to load freight onto a ferry set for Hull in solidarity with sacked workers. Are the P&O Ferries sackings legal?\nCalls grow for P&O boss to quit Unions have raised fears over a lack of training of new crew, after the firm replaced their members with workers whose average hourly rate of pay would be £5.50, less than the UK minimum wage. As the company's ships operate internationally and are registered overseas, the UK minimum hourly rate of £8.91 does not apply. At the Dover protest, RMT union national secretary Darren Procter said: \"Bringing a crew on board a vessel they're not familiar with to sail across the busiest shipping lane in the world, carrying passengers, is going to be a dangerous act.\" He said the MCA should detain every other P&O Ferries vessel around the UK on the basis they are not fit to sail. The European Causeway sails between Larne and Cairnryan in Scotland. P&O Ferries told customers on Twitter that its services on this route were suspended, adding: \"It is no longer possible for us to arrange travel via an alternative operator on this route. \"For essential travel, customers are advised to seek alternatives themselves.\" There were no passengers or freight aboard the European Causeway when it was impounded in Larne, the MCA confirmed. It said the vessel would remain under detention until all issues were resolved by P&O Ferries. Seamus Leheny, of freight industry body Logistics UK, said rival ferry operator Stena had increased capacity through Belfast by 50% but the situation was still causing difficulties for businesses. \"It's not sustainable to have so much freight coming through Belfast... we want that Larne service back up and running as soon as possible,\" he added. On Friday, Prime Minister Boris Johnson backed Transport Secretary Grant Shapps's calls for the boss of P&O Ferries to resign. Peter Hebblethwaite admitted to MPs that he broke the law by not consulting workers ahead of the job cuts - but said he would do the same again if he had to. Mr Shapps wrote on social media that the European Causeway's detention followed an instruction from him to the MCA to inspect \"all P&O vessels\" before they entered back into service. \"I will not compromise the safety of these vessels, and P&O will not be able to rush inexperienced crew through training,\" he added. Labour's Louise Haigh called for the sacked workers to be reinstated and for Mr Hebblethwaite to be \"barred\" as a director. \"The shameful misconduct of P&O Ferries has ruined livelihoods, and is harming the UK's key shipping routes,\" the shadow transport secretary wrote on Twitter. P&O Ferries said in a statement that an MCA inspection had deemed the European Causeway \"not sufficiently ready for entry into operation\". \"We shall review the findings, make any changes required and continue to work closely with the MCA to return the ship to service.\" Meanwhile P&O Ferries services between Dover and Calais remain cancelled. The firm said it would organise an alternative carrier for passengers. Saturday evening's service from Rotterdam to Hull is also suspended, the firm said - but the evening service from Hull to Rotterdam is expected to sail on time. ",

            "content": "Uber has been granted a two-and-a-half year licence to operate private hire vehicles in London. The ride-hailing firm was previously denied a licence by Transport for London in November 2019. But in September 2020, a judge upheld Uber's appeal against the decision and granted it an 18-month licence. Uber said it was \"delighted\" to be able to continue operating in the city and that it was \"pleased\" to have met Transport for London's standards. At the court hearing in 2020, deputy chief magistrate Tan Ikram said he had taken Uber's \"track record of regulation breaches\" into account but recognised the company had made efforts to address failings and had improved standards. A spokeswoman for Transport for London (TfL) said: \"Uber has been granted a London private hire vehicle operator's licence for a period of two-and-a-half years.\" On Twitter, Uber said: \"We're delighted to announce TfL has granted Uber a new 30 month licence in London. \"TfL rightly holds our industry to the highest regulatory and safety standards and we are pleased to have met their high bar. \"As we continue to serve London, we remain focused on raising industry standards in all areas. \"These include offering drivers the benefits and protections they deserve, ensuring all Londoners can get around safely and becoming a fully electric platform by 2025.\" In February 2021, the UK's Supreme Court ruled Uber drivers must be treated as workers rather than self-employed. The decision meant drivers could be entitled to minimum wage and holiday pay. Follow BBC London on Facebook, Twitter and Instagram. Send your story ideas to hellobbclondon@bbc.co.uk ",

            "header": "Calls for P&O Ferries boss Peter Hebblethwaite to resign grow",
            "content": "The prime minister has backed calls for the boss of P&O Ferries to resign over the no-notice sackings of 800 staff. Boris Johnson supported Transport Secretary Grant Shapps in urging Peter Hebblethwaite to step down after his \"brazen\" law breaking, No 10 said. He admitted to MPs that he broke the law by not consulting workers but said he would do the same again if he had to. A government spokesperson said it has asked for a review of P&O's actions. P&O Ferries replaced staff with agency workers paid less than the minimum wage. Mr Hebblethwaite prompted further anger when he told the transport committee P&O \"did choose not to consult\" on the move and \"did not believe there was any other way to do this\". P&O's owner DP World had warned Mr Shapps that Irish Ferries was a new \"low-cost competitor\" that would pose a challenge to the business, minutes from a meeting in November revealed. Mr Shapps had replied to DP World boss DP Sultan Ahmed Bin Sulayem: \"I'm aware of the issues relating to P&O. I recognise you will need to make commercial decisions, but please do keep us informed.\" But the transport secretary told BBC Breakfast the first he knew of the P&O sackings was when he was \"stood at the despatch box\" in the Commons last Thursday delivering a statement on another issue. He added that even if he had known in advance, \"it wouldn't have made any difference\", because P&O Ferries had already hired agency staff, security, and recorded the video \"behind everybody's backs\". The BBC has seen a letter Mr Hebblethwaite sent to P&O colleagues on Friday telling them \"this type of dismissal could not and would not happen again\". He called it a \"unique situation\" and said no criminal offence had been committed. He wrote that there had been \"a failure to comply with the obligation to consult\". P&O Ferries had made redundancies due to pandemic pressures before the mass sackings, but had previously consulted unions. Are the P&O Ferries sackings legal?\n'P&O Ferries weren't just jobs they were our homes'\nP&O boss admits not consulting on job cuts broke law\nP&O Ferries offers £100,000 to some sacked staff Friday's talks between union officials and P&O ended after 20 minutes without any agreement, the Rail, Maritime and Transport union (RMT) said. General secretary Mick Lynch said: \"P&O were not prepared to listen to any scenario or develop any idea that would provide a means to create a solution to the current disastrous situation.\" It has called for the immediate disqualification of Mr Hebblethwaite as a director. It also wants the government to reinstate sacked workers in their jobs. The Institute of Directors has said Mr Hebblethwaite could face court proceedings under the Company Directors Disqualification Act (1986). Dr Roger Barker, director of policy and governance, said this was due to Mr Hebblethwaite's suggestion that P&O knowingly broke the law by not consulting staff. \"[Mr Hebblethwaite] leaves himself and the rest of the board vulnerable to court proceedings for unfit conduct and the potential for disqualification as a director, not just of P&O but any UK company.\" Labour's shadow transport secretary, Louise Haigh, also called on the government to disqualify Mr Hebblethwaite as a company director. She told BBC News: \"The government can do more than just wait for the chief executive to go. The government should be investigating action against him to disqualify him as a company director now and in the future as well.\" Mr Shapps told BBC Breakfast the government would bring in measures next week to force P&O Ferries into a U-turn to re-employ staff on at least minimum wage. These changes would also affect the operator Irish Ferries, who he said have used \"the same model\". Asked about the action government could take against P&O, Mr Shapps admitted it \"can't directly\" revoke P&O's licence but said \"we do have some mechanisms\". \"There are a whole load of other things happening including letters going out to the ports from which they sail, then, as I mentioned, different types of legislation will be forthcoming, so we are going to make sure P&O have to U-turn on this.\" However, Beth Hale, partner at employment law firm CM Murray, questioned the government's capacity to force through a change. \"It's not clear what mechanisms the government is proposing to rely on to force a U-turn in this matter. The dismissals of the employees have already taken effect - and some may already have signed up to settlement agreements and accepted termination payments. \"There is no mechanism in the law as it currently stands which would allow the government or unions to force an employer to re-engage employees in those circumstances,\" she said, adding that pressure could be applied in different ways such as the Insolvency Service disqualifying individual P&O Ferries directors. A government spokesperson said that it has asked the Insolvency Service to review P&O Ferries' actions. \"This will include any scope to take legal action against the company's directors. We will not hesitate to take further action if we find evidence of wrongdoing,\" they added. P&O Ferries has said its 800 redundant staff will be offered £36.5m in total - with around 40 getting more than £100,000 each. The company said some employees are set to get 91 weeks' pay and the chance of new employment, and no employee would receive less than £15,000. Mr Shapps also told Radio 4's Today programme: \"What they've done is try to pay off, or attempt to pay off, their staff with higher redundancy payments...and therefore buy their silence and we cannot have a situation where laws are being creatively used and abused in this case.\" He said: \"The idea that you come to parliament and you admit that you deliberately set out to break the laws in order to sack your staff and bring in below minimum wage people and that you'll buy off the staff to do that is quite simply unacceptable. \"They've exploited loopholes, they've been completely disgraceful and I'm clear that is no way to behave and not the right individual to have at the top of a British business.\" ",

            "content": "Russia is considering accepting Bitcoin as payment for its oil and gas exports, according to a high-ranking lawmaker. Pavel Zavalny says \"friendly\" countries could be allowed to pay in the crypto-currency or in their local currencies. Earlier this week, Russian President Vladimir Putin said that he wanted \"unfriendly\" countries to buy its gas with roubles. The move is understood to be aimed at boosting the Russian currency, which has lost over 20% in value this year. Sanctions imposed by the UK, US and the European Union, following the invasion of Ukraine, have put a strain on Russia's rouble and raised its cost of living. However, Russia is still the world's biggest exporter of natural gas and the second largest supplier of oil. Mr Zavalny, who heads Russia's State Duma committee on energy, said on Thursday that the country has been exploring alternative ways to receive payment for energy exports. He said China and Turkey were among \"friendly\" countries which were \"not involved in the sanctions pressure\". \"We have been proposing to China for a long time to switch to settlements in national currencies for roubles and yuan,\" said Mr Zavalny. \"With Turkey, it will be lira and roubles.\" Mr Zavalny added: \"You can also trade bitcoins.\" Analysts said Russia may benefit from accepting the popular cryptocurrency, despite the risks. \"Russia is very quickly feeling the impact of unprecedented sanctions,\" said David Broadstock, a senior research fellow at the Energy Studies Institute in Singapore. \"There is a need to shore up the economy and in many ways, Bitcoin is seen as a high growth asset.\" However, he noted that the value of Bitcoin has swung by as much as 30% this year. In comparison, the dollar has traded within 5% against the euro. \"Clearly accepting Bitcoin, compared with other traditional currencies, introduces considerably more risk in the trade of natural gas,\" Mr Broadstock said. \"Moreover, one of the major 'friendly' trade partners for Russia is China, and cryptocurrency is banned for use in China,\" he added. \"This clearly limits potential for payment using Bitcoin.\" Are cryptocurrencies a lifeline for Afghans?\nMillions in Bitcoin donations pour into Ukraine There are concerns that Russian oligarchs could be using virtual currencies to avoid sanctions. This has spurred Ukraine's government as well as US and European politicians to ask crypto-currency platforms to ban all Russian users. But many firms have ruled this out. \"Some ordinary Russians are using crypto as a lifeline now that their currency has collapsed,\" said Brian Armstrong, chief executive of cryptocurrency firm Coinbase. He said: \"Many of them likely oppose what their country is doing, and a ban would hurt them, too.\" On Wednesday, Mr Putin's comments on making \"unfriendly\" countries pay in roubles drove the currency to a three-week high. However, many existing gas contracts are agreed upon in euros and it is unclear if Russia can change them. The EU relies on Russia for 40% of its gas. ",

            "header": "Russia's cost of living soars by more than 14%",
            "content": "The cost of living in Russia is surging following the country's invasion of Ukraine, according to new data. Official figures show price of some household staples - such as sugar - have jumped by as much as 14% over the past week. Inflation is set to keep rising in Russia where the rouble has fallen sharply since the Ukraine war began. The value of the currency has dropped about 22% this year, and this has pushed up the cost of importing goods. The inflation data came as the Russian stock market resumed trading on Thursday after a month-long hiatus, with the majority of shares rising in a volatile trading session. The benchmark Moex index closed 4.4% higher after surging over 10% in Moscow. Analysts said a government plan to buy billions of dollars worth of Russian shares was supporting the market, which dived last month after Russia invaded its neighbour. Bans on trade with foreigners and on short-selling remain in place. On Wednesday, Russia's economic ministry said annual inflation had jumped 14.5% in the week ending 18 March - the highest rate since late 2015. The Federal State Statistics Service said the cost of sugar rose by as much as 37.1% in certain regions of the country and increased by an average 14%. Sugar, which is commonly used to preserve food or make liquor, was the biggest gainer in the week, the government agency found. The price of onions was the second biggest riser over the week, up 13.7% nationwide and 40.4% in some areas. Meanwhile, nappies were 4.4% more expensive. Prices for black tea rose 4% and toilet paper increased by 3%. Stephen Innes, managing partner at SPI Asset Management, said prices were higher because of the weaker rouble. \"The biggest culprit is imported inflation,\" Mr Innes told the BBC. \"Anything Russia imports is exponentially (pricier) due to the weaker rouble.\" The UK, the US and the European Union have cut off a number Russian banks from financial markets in the West. They have also prohibited dealings with Russia's central bank, state-owned investment funds and the finance ministry. The Bank of Russia more than doubled its interest rate to 20% in March, in an attempt to stop its currency from sliding further. A large number of Western businesses have pulled out of Russia because of the war in Ukraine. Others, such as the Swiss food giant Nestle, have withdrawn major brands such as KitKat and Nesquik. Videos on social media show shoppers scrambling to buy sugar and buckwheat at supermarkets in Moscow. Deputy prime minister Viktoria Abramchenko has told Russians the country is \"fully self-sufficient when it comes to sugar and buckwheat\". \"There is no need to panic buy these goods. There is enough for everybody,\" she said. But some Russians told the BBC that they were feeling the squeeze. Ksenia Mironiuk said the price of many basic goods had \"gone up dramatically\" in St Petersburg. \"It's already quite noticeable when you go shopping,\" she said. \"Lots of people are buying them in bulk fearing they will disappear altogether.\" Merkutsio Anzhello, who lives in the southern city of Krasnodar, said staples now cost 10 to 20% more. But he said he is not too concerned: \"In general, neither I nor my relatives are not concerned about it. Prices in Russia grow sometimes and we are accustomed to this.\" Russia has hit back at international sanctions, and threatened to seize the assets of businesses that have stopped operating in the country. It sanctioned US President Joe Biden and 12 other US officials last week. On Wednesday, Russian President Vladimir Putin announced that the country would start selling natural gas to \"unfriendly\" countries in roubles. It is understood the move is aimed at supporting the currency. The EU relies on Russia for 40% of its gas. However, many existing contracts are agreed upon in euros and it is unclear if Russia can change them. Mr Putin's announcement drove the rouble to a three-week high. It later closed at 97.7 against the dollar. ",

            "header": "Dairy giant Arla warns of supply issues unless farmers paid more",
            "content": "The UK's largest dairy has warned milk supplies could be under threat unless its farmers are paid more. The managing director of Arla Foods said costs are increasing at rates never seen before and that farmers can no longer cover their expenses. \"Because of the recent crisis, feed, fuel and fertiliser have rocketed and therefore cashflow on the farm is negative,\" said Ash Amirahmadi. He added farmers are producing less milk as a result of the higher costs. \"UK dairy farmers have been producing more for about the last seven to eight years but it's now going the other way,\" Mr Amirahmadi told the BBC. \"In February, they produced 2% less and in March it's 4%.\" With cost increases of some 36%, he warned farmers are facing some hard decisions and that they need confidence to carry on producing. And that means securing a higher price from Arla's customers - the supermarkets. \"The most important thing now is that we put our arm around the farmers…and pay our farmers more to cover their costs to make sure the milk is flowing, \" said Mr Amirahmadi. Arla Foods is the fifth biggest dairy company in the world and the largest supplier of fresh milk and cream in the UK. The co-operative has 2,100 dairy farmers in the UK and 8,950 across Europe. David Christensen, an Arla dairy farmer based in Oxfordshire, said he had \"never experienced conditions like this in 30 years\" of working in the industry. His fertiliser bill has jumped from £350 to £900 a tonne and his fuel has more than doubled - cost increases he won't be able to absorb after the summer. \"There's no doubt, if the economics don't stack up one of the options is to scale back production...milk prices need to go up. It's no longer sustainable,\" he said. The boss of Arla said the price of milk in the shops is 7% lower now than it was 10 years ago. But the price consumers pay is different to the prices which farmers receive to produce it. For farmers the break even price is key. This includes any extra income and government subsidies. Over the years, the industry has kept costs down by becoming more efficient and many supermarkets have direct contracts with farmers based on their own cost of production models to try to give them a fairer deal. But industry sources have said even these so-called aligned contracts are failing to keep up with sky rocketing costs. Mr Amirahmadi's comments come as his business unveiled a five-year plan to grow and future proof the business at the same time it faces pressure from surges in inflation. Arla believes increasing global demand for dairy is an opportunity for farmers in the UK. The prices paid to farmers abroad are now 15% higher than the prices paid to farmers here. It's already trialling the export of fresh British milk for processing at its European sites which is then sold on international markets. The dairy giant is the first producer to consider doing this at scale. \"The good news here for farmers and actually the British dairy industry is that the opportunities of export give farmers more options and therefore it means that the whole of the UK dairy industry should get a lift as a result of those markets,\" Mr Amirahmadi said. As for the UK, he believes the dynamics need to change. He said for too many years the liquid milk market has been failing to deliver for farmers. \"Over the next five years we will have to make some tough decisions about where our milk goes to ensure farmers can cover their costs and continue to invest in reducing their on-farm emissions,\" he added. \"The profitability of some of our milk contracts will need to increase significantly when up for renewal in order to compete with more attractive business opportunities that are opening up.\" ",

            "content": "P&O Ferries boss Peter Hebblethwaite has admitted to MPs that a decision to sack 800 workers last week without notice broke the law. He said there was \"absolutely no doubt\" that under UK employment law the firm was required to consult unions before making the mass cuts. However, he said no union would have accepted the plan and it was easier to compensate workers \"in full\" instead. The P&O boss also said he would make the same decision again if he had to. Huw Merriman, the Conservative chair of the Transport Committee urged him to resign. \"It's untenable to come to parliament and say you decided to break the law, you have no regrets,\" Mr Merriman told BBC Radio 4's World at One. \"We can't have companies run by people like that. So he needs to hand his card in.\" The sackings of P&O staff sparked outrage after it emerged they will be replaced by foreign agency workers paid less than the minimum wage. Are the P&O Ferries sackings legal?\nP&O Ferries offers £100,000 to some sacked staff Addressing a committee of MPs on Thursday, Mr Hebblethwaite apologised for the distress caused by the cuts, but said they were necessary to save the business which has been loss-making. He said workers would receive \"extremely generous\" compensation, although as part of these settlements they would forgo their right to pursue further legal action against P&O. Asked whether P&O broke the law by not consulting the unions, Mr Hebblethwaite said: \"It was our assessment that the change [to staffing] was of such a magnitude that no union could possibly accept our proposal. \"So as I say, I completely throw our hands up, my hands up, that we did choose not to consult.\" He added: \"We did not believe there was any other way to do this and we are compensating people in full.\" Asked if he would change anything about the decision made last Thursday, he responded: \"That's a really, really difficult question. \"The business would close, the business was not viable. This is the only way for us to save this business and we have moved to a model that is internationally recognised and widely used across the globe and by our competitors. \"I would make this decision again I'm afraid.\" Peter Hebblethwaite apologised to workers. But he remained adamant there had been no other option and gave no indication that he would change course. MPs were aghast at his open admission that the business had chosen not to comply with the requirement to consult unions over planned redundancies. A representative of DP World, which owns P&O, said Mr Hebblethwaite would not be sacked. But after this morning's appearance, the calls for him to resign are growing. No P&O worker will get less than £15,000 in compensation, he said, and a small number will receive more than £100,000. Mr Hebblethwaite, who earns £325,000 a year as a base salary, said he could not say whether he would get a performance-related bonus after the sackings. In 2020, the directors of P&O were paid £1.9m in total, and the highest paid director got £452,000. Mr Hebblethwaite told MPs that the average hourly rate of pay for new P&O crewmembers would be £5.50 per hour, which is below the UK minimum wage. However, it is in line with international maritime standards. From 1 April, the UK minimum wage for people aged 23 and over will be £9.50. Mr Hebblethwaite said that the firm's new operating model was consistent with \"models throughout the globe and our competitors\". By sacking its crews and taking on agency staff instead, he said the business would cut its wage bill in half. Following the hearing MP Darren Jones, who chairs the business committee, said he was \"amazed\" by Mr Hebblethwaite's evidence. The Labour MP added: \"He should be fined, struck off and prosecuted.\" John, a former P&O seafarer, who started working in the ferry business when he was 16, also said the P&O boss should go. \"I am sickened and shocked by this man's arrogant explanation,\" he said. \"I don't even know if I've got the right words for how I'm feeling inside.\" Meanwhile, transport secretary Grant Shapps said he would take action to prevent similar mass sackings without notice. He said the government would \"have a package of measures\" to remove a \"loophole in the law\" it believed had been \"exploited\" by P&O. MPs on the committee also raised questions about the way P&O notified foreign governments that it was going to make the redundancies, which is a legal requirement. The company informed authorities in Barbados, Bermuda and Cyprus on 17 March - but MPs said it should have done this sooner. On Wednesday, Boris Johnson told the Commons that \"it looks like\" P&O breached a similar rule in the UK, but some employment lawyers have cast doubt on that claim. The company denies it breached any rules in this regard. ",

            "content": "After ravaging New York City's yellow cab industry, Uber is now taking steps to embrace it. The company will now list New York City yellow cabs on its app, a partnership Uber described as the latest step in a global effort to work with the taxi industry to unlock new markets. It already has similar arrangements in place in countries such as Spain, Germany, Austria and Turkey. Uber has been facing a driver shortage as it emerges from the pandemic. The deal will add about 14,000 taxi drivers licensed in New York City - one of its most important markets - to Uber's platform. Guy Peterson, director of business development for Uber, called it a \"win for drivers\". \"No longer do they have to worry about finding a fare during off-peak times to getting a street hail back to Manhattan when in the outer boroughs,\" he said. The number of rides in yellow taxis in New York has plunged since Uber launched in the city in 2011, as people opted for the ease of online booking. The collapse helped to push nearly a thousand drivers to file for bankruptcy in recent years. Under the partnership, the software companies that currently work with city-licensed cab drivers will integrate with Uber, which will take a cut of the fares. The companies did not say how much this would be. The offering will roll out to the public this spring. Riders hailing a yellow taxi via the app will pay fares comparable to an Uber X ride, according to a Wall Street Journal report that Uber confirmed. Shares in Uber rose on the news. But Bhairavi Desai, executive director of the New York Taxi Workers Alliance, said Uber should not make the mistake of thinking that this means its fights with drivers in New York are over. She said Uber typically pays about 15% less than what a driver could earn running the meter. \"The companies that tore up this industry need this more than the drivers do,\" said Ms Desai. \"The fare structure that is not enough for Uber drivers is also not going to be enough for yellow cab drivers.\" Bruce Schaller, a New York-based consultant who has studied the growth of Uber in the city, said the deal would benefit drivers and customers by widening market access, while helping the city control the number of empty cars adding to pollution and congestion problems as they look for customers. \"I've always felt that these industries would converge,\" he said. \"This is probably sooner than one would have expected...but clearly the pandemic has turned everything upside down and people are trying to put things back together in a way that will work.\" As Uber pursues this model in other cities, the firm may come to dominate the market even more, Mr Schaller said. But in New York City, he said hailing a taxi from the street was likely to remain an essential part of life. \"The street hail is still a big deal in New York,\" he added. Ryan Wanttaja, the acting head of New York's Taxi and Limousine Commission (TLC), which regulates the industry, said it was \"always interested in tools that can expand economic opportunities for taxi drivers\". \"We are excited about any proposal to more easily connect passengers with taxis and look forward to learning more about this agreement between Uber and the taxi apps and ensuring it complies with TLC rules,\" he said.

            "header": "Spotify paid 130 artists more than $5m last year",
            "content": "Spotify has revealed it paid $7bn to music industry rights holders last year, accounting for almost 25% of the industry's total revenues. The news came on the company's Loud And Clear website, which was launched last year with the aim of \"increasing transparency\" around its payments. The streaming giant said 52,600 artists earned more than $10,000 (£7,500) from Spotify in 2021. Of those, 130 were paid more than $5m (£3.8m) over the last 12 months. Spotify didn't name any of the artists involved, but its most-streamed acts last year were Bad Bunny, Taylor Swift, BTS, Drake and Justin Bieber; while the most streamed-song was Olivia Rodrigo's Drivers License. However, the streaming giant's raw figures do not tell the full story. For example, an artist whose music earns $10,000 in Spotify royalties might only receive $2,000, once the record label and publishers take their share. For a seven-piece band like BTS, that $2,000 has to be split seven ways. Songwriters and session musicians are paid even less, with many struggling to make ends meet. Even so, Spotify's data provides some insights into how artists are faring in the streaming era - with earnings falling into the following brackets: $10,000 - $49,999: 36,100 artists\n$50,000 - $99,999: 7,000 artists\n$100,000 - $499,999: 7,330 artists\n$500,000 - $999,999: 1,130 artists\n$1,000,000 - $1,999,999: 590 artists\n$2,000,000 - $4,999,999: 320 artists\n$5m and above: 130 artists About 28% of the artists who earned more than $10,000 last year (some 15,140) uploaded their own music via the likes of TuneCore, Ditto, DistroKid and CD Baby - which means they will have kept the bulk of their earnings. Spotify also estimated that, once revenues from rival streaming sites and CD sales were taken into account, most of these artists will have made about $40,000 (£30,000) last year. Of course, the musicians we're talking about represent the tip of a very sizeable iceberg. Spotify says about eight million people have uploaded tracks to its service, with 60,000 new songs arriving every day. As a result, 99.3% of the artists on Spotify are generating less than $10,000 a year. The company counters that more than half of the eight million artists on its database have uploaded fewer than 10 tracks, \"so they are quite early in their journey, or maybe doing it more as a hobby,\" said Spotify's global head of music product, Charlie Hellman, in an interview with Music Ally. He added that the number of artists generating more than $10,000 has risen by 10,100 in the last 12 months - and that \"the industry is half as top-heavy and half as star-concentrated as it was in the heyday of the CD.\" Global music spending surges to $26bn\nBTS were the top-selling act in the world last year\nApple and Spotify reveal 2021's most-streamed songs This is the same argument promoted by the wider music industry, which claims more artists are making a living in the streaming era than at any other time in history. The BPI, which represents the British music industry, says nearly 2,000 artists achieved more than 10 million UK streams in 2021, up 25% from the 2020 figure. \"The rise of streaming has empowered more artists than ever - from all backgrounds and eras - to build new fanbases around the world and to forge successful careers in music,\" said BPI chief executive Geoff Taylor in January. Earlier this week, it was revealed that total music industry revenues rose 18.5% in 2021 to reach $25.9bn (£19.5bn), the highest level since records began in the 1990s. On its Loud And Clear website, Spotify boasted about its contribution to that figure, claiming that its \"$7bn total is the largest sum paid by one retailer to the music industry in one year in history - including any single retailer at the height of the CD or digital download era.\" Follow us on Facebook, or on Twitter @BBCNewsEnts.

            "header": "Spring Statement: Why Rishi Sunak is holding back some firepower",
            "content": "The takeaway message from the morning after the chancellor's statement was an acknowledgement from both the PM and Rishi Sunak that they would have to do more eventually on the cost of living. This reflects the big choice made by the chancellor to bank the bulk of the proceeds of a rapid recovery in tax receipts. Borrowing will fall more rapidly, reflecting inflation, and previously announced tax rises. Powder is being kept dry, while the energy cap suppresses further rises in bills. The extent of any further support can be determined in summer when it will be clear if the new cap implies average bills of an incredible £200 per month or even a truly terrifying £300 per month. That in turn depends on the war in Ukraine and supplies of energy from Russia. Not even the Office for Budget Responsibility knows where this is going to land. But there is space for a support package of several billion, if required. Newspapers and think tanks gave a rather cool response to the Spring Statement, perhaps reflecting a change in the level of expectation of assistance from government, after the extraordinary help provided during the pandemic. For the chancellor this was more a case of \"what we can do for now\" rather than \"whatever it takes\". Taking both the energy support package and the tax adjustments made yesterday, the government has mitigated about a third of the squeeze from surging prices. The pandemic support worked in its primary aim. It ensured that workers did not disconnect from their employers, and prolong a self-fulfilling high unemployment downturn. But coming out of the pandemic lockdowns, many of these workers now face significant cost of living difficulties. The chancellor's decision to roll back £6bn of the National Insurance rise is concentrated on supporting those on just below average incomes. He did not, for example, choose to spend roughly the same amount on ensuring recipients of tax credits, benefits and pensions saw their income rise in line with inflation averaging 7% now, rather than the predetermined 3%. The net result of all that will be an increase in poverty which the Resolution Foundation think tank says has not been seen outside of a recession - a further 1.3 million in absolute poverty including 500,000 children. Sunak accused of not doing enough for poorest\nHow Rishi Sunak's Spring Statement will affect you Public sector pay is also being squeezed by rising inflation. Pay Review Bodies will decide the rise effective from next month, before the summer. The Treasury has previously indicated that pay should focus on the 2% inflation target rather than the actual rate of inflation. Mr Sunak is also effectively squeezing public services by keeping the cash totals for spending, despite the surge in inflation. Depending on the measure of inflation, it could mean an effective £20bn cut against Spending Review plans according to the Institute for Fiscal Studies, including £9.7bn for health and £1.7bn for defence. This seems likely to be revisited too. Overall the chancellor has kept back a tax revenue windfall, to deploy on soothing cost of living pressures for low paid workers, but not yet to spend on those on benefits or public sector workers. It leaves options open for further support, but raises questions about the timing of policy. Under current plans, real incomes for state pensioners and tax credit recipients will be cut now, with a rise of 3%, but they will increase next year, reflecting high levels of inflation in excess of 8%, forecast for the autumn. Likewise a tax cut of £5bn to help people's incomes has been timed for the pre-election year of 2024, yet a tax rise of £6bn is coming now at the same time the cost of living surges. One issue for the Treasury is uncertainty about how fast energy prices and inflation will return to more normal levels. That is why they have made a big choice to hold back some firepower. The pressure to use that may come far more rapidly than expected. ",

            "content": "A funeral plan provider with 45,000 customers in the UK has collapsed, throwing contracts into doubt and raising concern over refunds. Safe Hands had already signalled its intention to stop operating, but its collapse means pre-bought funerals may not be honoured. Administrators said the company could not provide immediate refunds, leaving many worried their money will be lost. The sector is facing an imminent overhaul, leaving other plans in doubt. From 29 July, any provider must be authorised and regulated by the Financial Conduct Authority (FCA) which, from that point onwards, will give consumers far greater protection than they have at the moment. Safe Hands was one of dozens of companies operating in the currently unregulated pre-paid funeral sector. Customers such as Lyn Burrow, 72, and her husband Fred, 80, signed up to contracts that saved their family the expense and emotional cost of organising their funerals when they die. The couple spent a total of £6,310 on their plan, which she said had given them \"peace of mind\". She spoke to BBC Radio 4's Money Box programme about her concerns when it emerged that Safe Hands had decided to stop operating when new regulations begin. Now, following news that the company is in administration, those fears have heightened. She said: \"My family was supposed not to have to worry, but what are we going to do now?\" \"If we could at least recover some of the money, we could make up the difference with a reputable company. But £6,000 is a lot of money. It would have to come from our savings.\" Joint administrator Nedim Ailyan, partner at FRP, said they would carry out a detailed investigation to discover what could be returned to creditors, including policyholders - whose funds are in a trust fund, which itself has a shortfall compared to what is required for full refunds. \"Regrettably, the administration means the company is not in a position to issue refunds at this time. We appreciate how upsetting this period of uncertainty will be for Safe Hands Plans' customers and their families,\" he said. \"Unfortunately, there is a shortfall between the level of plan holder investments and the forecast level of funeral plan costs to be paid. Essentially, the value of the investments is not enough to meet the funeral plan obligations of the company.\" Any funeral plans activated in the next two weeks, because the policyholder has died, will be covered by another provider - Dignity. Mr Ailyan said a \"longer-term solution\" was being sought beyond that deadline, and customers - or their loved ones - would be contacted. A helpline has been set up on 0800 640 9928. Funeral costs drop for first time in 18 years\nCold-calling ban among plans for pre-paid funerals The FCA said it was reforming the sector because elderly, and very often vulnerable, customers have been subjected to unfair practices such as high pressure sales tactics and cold calls. It wants to raise standards by regulating what companies can and cannot do. However, a FCA spokeswoman said that, in the case of Safe Hands, its powers were limited because it had yet to come under the regulator's jurisdiction. \"People who bought a pre-paid funeral plan with Safe Hands will be understandably concerned, which is why we welcome Dignity stepping in to provide funerals for the next two weeks,\" she said. \"We will continue to support the administrators and industry to see whether there is a longer-term solution for Safe Hands' customers.\" Mike Hilliar, director for funeral planning at Dignity, said: \"Dignity stands by its commitment to provide assistance where we can, and we will be working with others in the industry to come to a resolution to help customers of Safe Hands, or indeed of other plan providers that do not achieve authorisation with the regulator.\" 1.6 million customers\n200,000 funeral plans taken out every year\nApproximately 65 companies\nAverage plan costs £4,000\nAverage plan lasts for 8 years Source: FCA/Fairer Finance As the funeral plan market is being reformed, industry insiders are worried that this could mean more of the 65 providers will go out of business, leaving tens of thousands of customers out of pocket. Whilst many of the larger, more reputable firms are expected to be granted authorisation by the FCA, others are unlikely to even apply for authorisation or will be turned down. If that happens they will be unable or not allowed to operate beyond 29 July. While customers who have signed up to plans very recently can cancel during a cooling-off period, others will have to wait to see what happens to their provider and their plan. ",

            "content": "High street retail giant Next has warned it will need to increase prices even further later this year. The retailer said prices for homeware items will jump 13% and fashion prices rise 6.5% in the second half of 2022 to average an 8% increase overall. Clothing prices are already rising, with inflation data showing overall clothing and footwear prices rose 8.8% in the year to February 2022. The retailer said it still expects to make a £850m profit this year. Across the UK economy companies have been passing on higher energy, shipping and oil costs to customers, leading to surging prices for everything from tinned tomatoes and Marmite, to used cars and home insurance. Next had already warned of incoming price rises in January, but it has now increased its estimate of price increases in the second half of the year from 6% to 8%. It still predicts sales to grow overall - despite the price rises - but not by as much as first thought, which it said was due to the closing of its Ukrainian and Russian websites. Next's chief executive, Lord Simon Wolfson, told the PA news agency that, given the worsening cost of living crisis, trading could be \"subdued\" for the rest of the year. \"Over the past 20 years, we've seen that what really matters is what's in people's bank accounts rather than costs,\" he said. \"In January, when we laid down our outlook, people suggested it could be pessimistic but we thought confidence could be subdued.\" The company also flagged that demand could be dented as people spend their disposable incomes elsewhere, with a return to spending on holidays abroad and other social activities. However, for now, Next said the first three months of the year had seen UK sales \"ahead of where we expected them to be\" as people headed back to its stores after lockdown and purchased more formal fashion and fewer things for their homes. Next also reported pre-tax profits of £823m for the year to 31 January, more than double the amount of the previous year and 10% above pre-pandemic levels. ",

As this has also been a very challenging period for business, how have they thrived and why did they choose the cathedral city in Hertfordshire? The St Albans district has a population of just over 147,000 and it has become known as an ideal commuter town due to its position just north of the M25, with fast - if rather crowded - rail links to central London. Instant Offices, which specialises in finding office space, analysed Companies House data to work out which towns and cities had attracted most new businesses and found St Albans had one of the largest growth rates in the UK. With 1,597 new companies in 2021 and 1,311 in 2020 - a 21.8% increase. Other towns and cities with similar growth levels include Doncaster in South Yorkshire with 26.9% and Preston in Lancashire with 24.6%, according to the researchers. Instant Offices cites a rise in remote working and online shopping as reasons for the start-ups across the UK. Jennifer Clarke had been working in payroll for her husband's business since 2014, and had also started training to be a meditation teacher when the first lockdown hit in March 2020. \"I continued my training in the first lockdown and everything also moved online,\" she says. \"I thought I could still help people this way and - as you also get wisdom and intuition through meditation - I suddenly said I'm going to start up a business. \"So I started my website and [lockdown] also gave me the time and space to build a good base and set up my social media which I'd not really been on before.\" After that, the business took off and she concentrated on it full time, setting up Meditation Courses Ltd in October 2020. By the following January, during England's third lockdown, she was \"rushed off my feet\". \"Because of the pandemic, people are thinking how they can help themselves... thinking about their mental health more and looking for help, and companies want to look after their staff,\" she says. \"Online I'm able to reach people all over the country and around the world - I've been quite shocked at how much I've been able to help people.\" Ms Clarke, who has lived in St Albans for about 20 years says the local business community has been \"very helpful\". Anna Venetico from the St Albans Chamber of Commerce said lockdowns led to people looking at \"that arduous commute\" into the capital and taking that leap to set up on their own. \"We've had accountants and marketeers going solo and digital marketing is huge,\" she says. \"We're seeing more of the creative-type marketing industries opening. \"During lockdown people had time to experience things locally and realised they didn't have to go into London... they are looking at things differently. \"We've always had a thriving business community and have all the services people need, so it's the perfect place to be.\" \"My business grew very quickly\", says Rachel Kepinska-Smith from Rachel KS Consulting, which specialises in branding. She had left the corporate world in 2015 for better work/life balance and had already been working from home for a franchise. She decided that on 1 March 2020 she would \"flick the switch\" and move to full-time marketing consultancy, and three weeks later the country was in lockdown. \"It was quite intense... I started the business having to home-school a nine-year-old and keep a three-year-old entertained,\" she says. \"Businesses had to refocus and diversify, but to be credible they had to focus on their niche - who are you and what difference can you make. I helped them find that.\" Ms Kepinska-Smith, who has lived in the city since 2009, says: \"You don't have to scratch the surface long before you find an ex-London person who has left to do their own thing and is well connected so people can make anything happen. \"It's scary going from PAYE to being on your own. It's tough for business owners and without the right support it's hard, so to have a community of people, who get it, around you is great.\" Social media consultant Rebecca Youngs had just set up The Social Den after retraining as a social media manager, but when Covid hit, businesses were either unable to run or could not afford to pay her so she \"lost all her client base over a week\". She teaches businesses how to use all the features of Instagram and helps them make a content strategy, so after transferring all her business online, she did regular Instagram posts and had a very successful year. \"I started online workshops and didn't charge very much,\" she says. \"It was cheap and accessible so it got a lot of interest and my online training has grown.\" She says she feels like she \"really benefitted from the situation in 2020\" as many businesses had to really look at online strategies. \"Many barely had a website so it was a steep learning curve and I helped them,\" she says. She adds that there are a lot of factors that make St Albans attractive. \"A lot of people have worked in London and then had families and don't want to commute, but they were in good jobs so are capable of running their own business,\" she says. \"Also it's an affluent area so there are people to buy from you; I've never struggled to find clients here whereas people I know in other areas have.\" Rachel Brown and her husband Stuart started their young children's gift box website An-Edit a year ago, while still holding down retail jobs as employees. With Rachel on furlough and pregnant, she says it was \"probably the prime time to think about starting up\" her own business to realise a long-held dream. \"Lockdown gave us that push... [we thought] if we don't give it a go now then when would be the right time? It gave us focus and clarity,\" she says. \"It was also the type of business - people couldn't go out and look round the shops and we were offering nice gift sets and a personalised card - it was an easy one-stop shop for a gift.\" Promoting mainly on social media, lockdowns gave them a captive audience. People searched online for baby gifts which led customers to their website. \"[In the current situation] it's the companies that make things easier for customers that do well,\" Mr Brown says. Buoyed by the business \"going better than we thought\", Mr Brown then set up a men's gifting company called Stand Accused in November. \"There are a lot of connections for advice and things,\" he says of St Albans. \"Even on the school run there are people who will know somebody. It's a place of ideas and people.\" Ginny Cooper from the St Albans Enterprise Agency, which provides free one-to-one advice and training to prospective start-ups, says it is a \"very collaborative place\" to start a business with a large number of networking groups. She said about 30% of people they had meetings with ended up starting their own businesses, and about two-thirds of them were women. \"Businesses that have done well in the last couple of years are ones that have helped people throughout the pandemic,\" she says.

            "header": "Spring Statement: How have people received today's announcements?",
            "content": "The Chancellor of the Exchequer's Spring Statement has raised the amount people can earn before paying National Insurance and cut fuel by 5p a litre. Rishi Sunak faced pressure to act as household budgets are squeezed amid soaring energy costs and rising household bills due to increasing inflation. The VAT rate on hospitality, food and non-alcoholic beverage sales was already set to rise to 20% - from 12.5% - on 1 April and businesses were hoping Mr Sunak was going to change his mind and keep it at the lower rate. He did not and many fear they will not survive. What do people think about his decisions? The proprietor of the Orchard Tea Garden in Grantchester, near Cambridge said he met the chancellor's statement with \"absolute fury beyond belief\". Charles Bunker says a 20% VAT rate could end his business. During the lockdowns, he was only able to trade for 17 weeks last year and shut down four times, losing stock every time. \"I don't know how a chancellor can up VAT by 60% on businesses like mine, while the banks are getting a 60% reduction in their tax,\" he says. \"I am going to have to find an extra £55,000 a year if I don't put up my prices.\" The changes Mr Sunak has made to the National Insurance threshold and business rates will help him by £10,000 over the year but that still leaves him £45,000 out of pocket. He says his business is already \"suffering from hyperinflation\" over the past year which has been \"quite staggering\". Flour has gone up 90% and sugar by 52% - plus his heating bill is about to go from an average of £1,400 a month to £3,000 and staff costs have \"gone through the roof\", he says. Mr Bunker says he currently charges £8.80 for a cream tea but upping his prices in order to \"absorb these costs without moving into a loss\" plus a rise in VAT would take the price to just over £10, which he says is \"unsustainable\". \"I do not believe that over £10.00 for a cream tea is sustainable in this business when people are between £300 and £500 a month worse off,\" he said. \"My product becomes unaffordable, it's completely barking, it's the economics of the madhouse.\" Justin Kempson, sales and innovation director at Huntingdon packaging company Charpak, says he can see the cost of living crisis affecting business. The company, which has been designing and making sustainable packaging for food and retail for more than 30 years, saw its energy costs triple last October. \"That's had a massive impact on profitability, I would say 80% of our profit of the last three months of the year was wiped out by those increased prices,\" he says. Materials have doubled in price in some cases which also has an impact on food price inflation because products will \"cost more on the shelf\", he says. Mr Kempson says he did not expect the government to do anything in terms of monetary support but he was looking for help with \"ease of access to cheaper finance\" and \"government-backed loans\". \"He did make some sort of announcement about tax relief on business investment but I will need to see what that means for small and medium-sized businesses before making comment,\" he says. \"The National Insurance announcement is good for our employees but there was not a lot for businesses.\" German language teacher, Sam McEvoy, from Norwich, welcomed the \"small price decrease\" in fuel duty but says other issues meant the bills would remain high. \"We'll be paying for the pandemic and things that are happening world-wide for a long, long time, I think,\" she says. The teacher has started cycling to work as petrol is still \"too expensive\", and she could not rely on public transport. \"Obviously there are a lot of people who have to use the car, maybe disabled people,\" she says. Her family has already made changes to its household expenditure, cutting back on eating out from every week to \"once, maybe twice a month\". \"We used to get a Hello Fresh subscription every month, eating healthily,\" says Ms McEvoy. \"We can't afford that now... food shopping has definitely increased.\" Part-time optometrist Pam Lee, who lives in Lower Gresham in north Norfolk, says she was in a \"quite fortunate\" position as all her children had now left home. \"It's just me and my husband and we're alright. We don't have a mortgage,\" she says, but she worries how her children will cope with additional costs. \"One of my daughter's has to pay for childcare and that's expensive,\" she says. \"And salaries are not going up in line with the extra expenses. Obviously she has to have petrol to get to work, and the food bills, heating... I worry about their future, they've got it far more difficult than I had. \"They're repaying their university loans whereas I had a grant... and could buy a house straight away. \"I don't think a lot of younger people can get on the housing ladder without the help of the bank of Mum and Dad and a deposit,\" adds Mrs Lee. Speaking after his Spring Statement Rishi Sunak said: \"I can't protect everyone from all the global challenges we face, [but] the policies announced today will put billions of pounds back into the pockets of hard-working families.\" The key announcements in the Chancellor's statement have been criticised by the main opposition parties. Shadow chancellor, Rachel Reeves, accused Mr Sunak of not understanding the \"scale of the challenge\" facing families and households. She said the Labour Party's windfall tax policy would have allowed the government to cut VAT on energy bills and make support for vulnerable people more generous. The leader of the Liberal Democrats said the Spring Statement had been a \"total swindle\" with the chancellor \"giving with one hand and taking with another\". Sir Ed Davey said the Lib Dems would have provided a much bigger one-off cut in VAT, costing the Treasury £18bn, but giving household £600 to \"help reflate the economy\".

            "header": "How Rishi Sunak's Spring Statement will affect you",
            "content": "Everyone across the UK is facing the sharpest rise in their cost of living for decades. Chancellor Rishi Sunak's Spring Statement is primarily an update on the current state, and future expectations, of the nation's finances. But he also announced some big, new policies that will affect our personal budgets in the coming months and years. Bringing together expected changes in earnings, reforms to taxes, and the recently announced energy measures, a middle earner on £27,500 per year can expect to be about £360 worse off this year than they were last, according to economists at the Institute for Fiscal Studies. Many of the necessities we buy - notably food, fuel and energy - have been rising in price. On Wednesday, official figures revealed that the cost of a whole host of goods and services, from furniture to toys, have also been increasing sharply. The Office for National Statistics (ONS) said prices rose by 6.2% in the 12 months to February - the fastest for 30 years. The chancellor's Spring Statement confirmed that consumers should be braced for things getting more expensive at a faster rate later in the year. Official forecasts, from the Office for Budget Responsibility, suggest inflation (which charts the rising cost of living) will average 7.4% this year, peaking at around 9% at the end of the year. The big question for anyone with a job is whether their pay will rise in line with prices. We already knew that the minimum pay rate for those aged 23 and above - the National Living Wage - will go up by 6.6%, as the hourly rate increases from £8.91 to £9.50. Inflation-matching wage rises in themselves could create a problem for the economy as a whole, by creating an inflationary spiral. It remains highly unlikely that employers will put up wages by that much when facing their own cost pressures, particularly their firm's energy bills. In September, the government announced that employees will pay 1.25p more in the pound from their pay packet in National Insurance contributions from this April. In a significant move, he has now said that the earnings threshold at which people start to pay National Insurance will rise. What will National Insurance changes cost me? At present, most workers start paying National Insurance contributions when their income hits £9,568. They pay 12% of earnings between £9,568 and £50,270, then 2% on any earnings above £50,270. Now the chancellor has said, from July, National Insurance will be paid on income over £12,570 a year - the same level as income tax starts being paid. In practice, the two measures will mean that anyone earning less than about £35,000 a year will pay less National Insurance during the year. That is about 70% of all workers. Those who earn more will see a tax rise, albeit smaller than they would have expected. For an employee earning £20,000 a year, it means an annual National Insurance cut of £180 in 2022-23, instead of an £89 rise expected before the announcement, according to accountancy firm Deloitte\nFor a £40,000 earner, it means a rise of £70, instead of a previously expected £339 rise\nFor a £60,000 earner, it means a £320 rise, instead of a previously expected £589 rise Self-employed people, who pay at a different rate, will see slightly less of a benefit from the chancellor's decision. Over time, this threshold is frozen, which will steadily mean more low-earners will have to pay. Early last year Mr Sunak said the thresholds at which income tax is paid would be frozen at April 2021 levels for five years (although Scotland has different levels). That means pay rises will push more people into higher tax bands. At the end of his speech, he pledged to reduce the basic rate of income tax by 1p in the pound before the end of the Parliament in 2024. Millions of households are facing a £693 (54%) rise in the cost of a typical annual gas and electricity bill, to about £2,000, when the regulator's new, higher price cap takes effect on 1 April. The latest analysis from Cornwall Insight suggests there will be a further £541 a year (27%) rise in October, before falling back. The OBR has predicted a £850 rise in October. Mr Sunak said he had already taken \"decisive action\", in helping people with their bills. This includes a £150 council tax rebate for 80% of households, followed by a £200 discount on bills in October which will need to be repaid, and an expansion to a support scheme for vulnerable people. In a longer-term move, he said that VAT would be cut from 5% to 0% on energy efficiency products such as solar panels, insulation and heat pumps. Prices to fill up the car with fuel were rising before the war in Ukraine - and the fallout from Russia's invasion has made things worse. The average price of petrol has risen by more than 40p per litre since last year's Spring Statement. The chancellor announced a 5p a litre reduction in fuel duty for the next year, which takes some of the sting out of rising prices, The RAC motoring organisation said that move would knock £3.30 off the cost of filling a typical 55 litre family car. Benefits and the state pension are rising by 3.1% in April, well below the rising cost of living. This prompted many charities to call on the chancellor to go further. Mr Sunak did not agree, saying nothing new about benefit and pension levels. However, if inflation does reach the levels predicted by the OBR. then benefits and the state pension could see a significant rise in April 2023 - as the increases are usually linked to the inflation rate in the preceding autumn. Local councils will be given another £500m in the Household Support Fund, which supports vulnerable people with payments and grants such as vouchers to help pay their bills. ",

            "header": "How much is fuel duty and what will the cut on petrol save you?",
            "content": "The government is cutting fuel duty on petrol and diesel by 5p per litre. It says the reduction, which will last for a year, will help drivers cope with rising fuel costs. Chancellor Rishi Sunak announced the measure in his Spring Statement. Fuel duty is a government tax which makes up part of the price when you buy petrol, diesel or other fuel for vehicles or heating. For petrol and diesel it has been 58p per litre for the past 11 years. Another tax, VAT at 20% is applied on top of this. Fuel duty accounts for over a third of the price of a litre of petrol. It earns a lot of money for the government - £28bn in 2019-20, or about £1,000 per household. According to the RAC, a 5p reduction in fuel duty makes it £3.30 cheaper to fill up a typical family car with a 55-litre tank. Filling that car up with petrol on 21 March, for example, would have cost more than £90. Pressure to take action has grown because prices at the pump have risen to a record high. Petrol reached £1.67 per litre on Sunday 20 March and diesel £1.79. The price rises - up more than 40p per litre since last year's Spring Statement - mean the government is now getting an extra 7p per litre in VAT from fuel. So the chancellor can afford to cut fuel duty by 5p and still be making more per litre in tax than he did a year ago. The price of fuel has increased because the price for crude oil, which is used to make petrol and diesel, has risen. At the start of the Covid pandemic demand for energy collapsed - pushing down prices. As life has returned to normal - and demand for energy has grown - suppliers have sometimes struggled to meet this demand and prices have risen. Prices were rising before the war in Ukraine - and the fallout from Russia's invasion has made things worse. The US has announced a complete ban on Russian oil imports. The UK is to phase out Russian oil by the end of the year. Russia is the European Union's biggest oil trading partner and is one of the world's largest oil exporters. Could the world cope without Russian oil and gas?\nWhy is turning to Saudi Arabia for oil controversial?\nUN chief: fossil fuel rush due to war is 'madness' It means demand for oil from other producers has increased, leading to higher prices. And although the UK imports just 6% of its crude oil from Russia, it is still affected when global prices rise. When wholesale energy prices move, petrol and diesel prices usually do too. But petrol retailers don't always pass on all of the changes to their customers immediately, or in full. In January, the RAC accused petrol retailers of keeping prices unnecessarily high and taking extra profits even after wholesale prices dipped. But the Petrol Retailers Association said customers bought 15% less fuel last year and retailers had to make higher profits on each litre sold to cover their overheads. ",

            "content": "The cost of living continued to soar last month, according to official figures. Prices rose by 6.2% in the 12 months to February - the fastest for 30 years - as fuel, energy and food costs surged. Prices are rising faster than wages and the Bank of England thinks it could hit double digits this year. Chancellor Rishi Sunak and Prime Minister Boris Johnson have been under pressure to do more to help struggling households. Inflation is the rate at which prices rise. If a bottle of milk costs £1 and that rises by 5p, then milk inflation is 5%. Why are prices rising so quickly?\nHow could Rishi Sunak's plans affect you? Since December last year, prices have been rising at their fastest rate since the 1990s. Inflation is expected to speed up in April when the energy price cap is increased. This will push up the average household fuel bill up by £693 a year in England, Scotland and Wales, while a planned rise in National Insurance will also put pressure on household budgets. \"Rising inflation remains a significant concern for the economy, squeezing household incomes and increasing cost pressures on retailers,\" said Helen Dickinson, chief executive of the British Retail Consortium. Paul Dales, chief UK economist at Capital Economics, said the pick up in inflation \"adds to the pressure on the chancellor to offset more of the cost of living crisis\". In his Spring Statement, Mr Sunak said that the war in Ukraine had a \"significant impact\" on the cost of living in the UK. In the statement he cut fuel duty by 5p per litre, raised the threshold for National Insurance to £12,570, and announced a cut to the basic rate of income tax to 19% from 20% in 2024. But Labour's shadow chancellor Rachel Reeves said Mr Sunak's choices \"were making the cost of living crisis worse, not better\". She said he should have put a windfall tax on oil and gas companies and scrapped the national insurance hike. The Office for National Statistics (ONS) said gas prices were almost a third higher in February than a year earlier, and electricity prices were up by nearly a fifth. Average diesel prices hit their highest on record during the month, while food prices rose nearly 1% - the largest monthly increase since 2012. ONS chief economist Grant Fitzner said prices of other goods such as toys, clothing and furniture also climbed. \"The price of goods leaving UK factories has also been rising substantially and is now at its highest rate for 14 years,\" he added. What these figures lay bare is that the cost of living crunch is unavoidable. Consumers have already been facing the financial reality of more expensive food, fuel and energy - all of which are necessities for pretty much every household. Now the ONS has confirmed that price rises are more widespread. Buying your child a toy for their birthday is more expensive than it was a year ago. Getting a new sofa takes a bigger chunk of your disposable income. The worry is that there is more of this to come, not least that analysts are predicting that a typical household energy bill will rise by £500 a year in October, on top of the annual £693 increase which takes effect at the start of April. As pandemic restrictions have eased around the world, firms have faced higher energy, shipping and wage costs, which they have passed on to consumers. Russia's invasion of Ukraine is now driving the price of oil and other commodities even higher. Average petrol and diesel prices hit new record highs on Tuesday, according to the RAC, with petrol hitting 167.30p per litre and diesel hitting 179.72p. RAC fuel spokesman Simon Williams said cheaper wholesale prices had yet to be passed on to consumers. \"The cost of filling an average 55-litre family car with petrol is now more than £92 and nearly £99 for diesel, making the £100 tank inevitable,\" he said.

Andrew Selley is chief executive of Bidfood, one of the largest UK food wholesalers, which supplies more than 45,000 caterers and food firms.

He added that a cut in fuel duty would help: \"I mean, fuel is obviously a driver across the whole industry, both from getting [food] from the farmer to the manufacturer, from the manufacturers to ourselves and from ourselves to the customers, so any relief on fuel would help to mitigate some of those increases coming through.\" ",

            "header": "South Korea sued to stop deep-sea gas pipeline",
            "content": "Aboriginal people from northern Australia have filed a lawsuit aimed at stopping South Korea funding a proposed deep-sea gas field. They say a 300km gas pipeline threatens their way of life and risks harming turtles near their Tiwi Islands home. The Barossa gas field, located in seas north of Darwin, was partially approved by Australia's offshore energy regulator last week. The gas giant Santos plans to begin drilling wells in the next few months. If the project is given full approval, Santos wants to construct an undersea gas pipeline alongside Bathurst Island, the western-most island in the Tiwi archipelago. At its closest point, the pipeline will be 6km from shore. Aboriginal groups from the Tiwi Islands, located in the Timor Sea north of Australia, say they were not properly consulted about the project. The legal challenge aims to prevent South Korea from lending approximately A$950m (£530m) to Santos via the state-owned Export-Import Bank of Korea and the Korea Trade Insurance Corporation. Lawyers filed an injunction in the Seoul Central District Court on Wednesday under a law known as the Korean Civil Execution Act. It seeks to prevent potential damage - either to the environment or to South Korea's future financial position if the investment fails - by prohibiting the financing from going ahead. If the legal action is successful, lawyers say the financial viability of the entire project is at risk. Jikilaruwu Tiwi Island clan leaders Francisco Babui and Daniel Munkara have accused Santos and the previous owner of the project, ConocoPhillips, of disregarding the islanders' concerns. \"Under Australian law and in accordance with Aboriginal tradition, the Jikilaruwu clan is the owner of the sea country where that gas pipeline will go through. We are the decision makers for that sea country,\" Mr Munkara said in a statement released by the Stop Barossa Gas Campaign group. \"We were told briefly about the pipeline in 2018 and we said 'no' to the project. They said it wasn't happening. Now we find out Santos wants to lay the pipeline through our sea country without our consent.\" Santos declined to comment. Environmental campaigners in Australia have long criticised the Barossa plan. They say the proposed gas field and pipeline will damage the unique marine environment in the Timor Sea, including turtle nesting areas. \"You've got this massive continental shelf that extends off northern Australia, and that continental shelf is covered in big drowned river valleys, which means there's a real diversity of habitat,\" said marine biologist Jason Fowler from the Environment Centre Northern Territory, which is supporting the legal fight. \"The Timor Sea is quite warm and shallow and muddy - it's dominated by sponges, not corals,\" he said. \"There are over 900 species of sponges out there, some of them are undiscovered. We've only mapped about 10% of this area. So it's very much a wild frontier, that we are only just beginning to understand.\" The pipeline Santos proposes would pass through an area designated as as a \"habitat protection zone\" in the Ocean Shoals Marine Park. Under Australian government rules for the management of marine parks, gas pipelines can be constructed within such zones under license. Those rules were approved by Australian Treasurer Josh Frydenberg when he was the minister for energy and environment in 2018. Mr Fowler said he lobbied Mr Frydenberg at the time, and asked him to introduce stronger protections for marine parks, but that the minister had \"ignored the science and listened to the oil and gas industry\". \"When you build a gas pipeline across the sea floor, it's like building a railway line across the country,\" he said. \"You've got to build bridges over valleys, you've got to dredge out areas of high ground, you've got to try and make it as flat and even as possible, because you don't want your pipeline going up and down. So there's a lot of habitat modification.\" Tiwi Islander Francisco Babui echoes those concerns. \"The pipeline is too close to Cape Fourcroy [on the islands' western tip]. There is a reef there with lots of turtles and dugongs,\" he said. \"The turtles lay their eggs on that beach and we go hunting in that area. We use that coastline for camping and fishing. Other critics of the Barossa plan have questioned the viability of drilling for gas that contains a relatively high proportion of carbon dioxide. John Robert, a chemical engineer with 40 years' experience in the oil and gas sector, said that means carbon emissions from Barossa will be especially high. \"The Barossa project would produce about one and a half tonnes of CO2 for every tonne of Liquefied Natural Gas (LNG) it produces, so it would in fact be a CO2 factory with an LNG by-product,\" he said. \"And that's before you transport it, turn the LNG back into natural gas, and then burn it in a power station. So it's going to be about the dirtiest LNG around. But unfortunately Santos seems very determined to move ahead with it.\" Mr Frydenberg and ConocoPhillips declined to comment. Australia's offshore energy regulator, the National Offshore Petroleum Safety and Environmental Management Authority, said a range of environmental and safety approvals need to be granted before gas extraction or production can begin at the Barossa field.

            "content": "India's aviation regulator has placed the country's fleet of Boeing 737 planes under \"enhanced surveillance\" after a jet crashed in China. It said it has sent out teams \"to monitor flight procedures, air worthiness and operations\". On Monday, a China Eastern Airlines Boeing 737-800 crashed in southern China with 132 people onboard. Rescue teams are working at the site but it is not yet known what caused the incident. The flight was travelling from Kunming to Guangzhou when it plunged to the ground and caught fire. China Eastern Airlines has grounded all its 737-800s. Rescuers search for China plane crash survivors\nAir disasters timeline \"Flight safety is serious business and we are closely studying the situation,\" said Arun Kumar, chief of India's Directorate General of Civil Association. \"In the interim, we are focusing on enhanced surveillance of our 737 fleet.\" India's SpiceJet, Vistara and Air India Express all have Boeing 737 aircraft in their fleets. The European Union Aviation Safety Agency said it had \"no information at this time that would warrant any safety actions with respect to the 737-800 in Europe\". \"As with all with all safety investigations, we are in contact with the state of design authority of the aircraft,\" a spokesperson told the BBC. \"We will be monitoring findings from the investigation closely and take any safety actions required.\" The BBC has approached regulators in the US and China for comment. US plane-maker Boeing said it was assisting investigations in China and communicating with the US National Transportation Safety Board. The BBC is not responsible for the content of external sites.\nView original tweet on Twitter Boeing's chief executive David Calhoun said: \"We have been in close communication with our customer and regulatory authorities since the accident, and have offered the full support of our technical experts to the investigation led by the Civil Aviation Administration of China.\" He added that the company would do \"everything we can to support our customer and the accident investigation during this difficult time, guided by our commitment to safety, transparency, and integrity at every step\". There are 4,208 Boeing 737-800 passenger planes in service, according to aviation analytics firm Cirium, with over a quarter of them based in China. Boeing 737-800s, which were first produced in the late 1990s, have a strong safety record. The plane involved in Monday's incident was less than seven years old. Investigators are still determining the reason for the crash in a wooded area of the Guangxi hills and will be searching for the plane's \"black box\" flight recorders for information. Boeing has been attempting to recover from two fatal crashes involving its 737 MAX aircraft which claimed the lives of 346 passengers and crew. Cai von Rumohr, an analyst at investment bank Cowen, said: \"Given Boeing's problems with the 737 MAX, there is some chance that consumers may not want to fly on a 737 until the cause of the China Eastern crash is determined not to be a design or manufacturing issue. \"Hence, isolating the cause of the crash will be critical.\" Boeing's share price fell by 3.5% in New York on Monday. China Eastern Airlines has set up a hotline for people seeking information about those on board. It expressed \"its deep condolences for the passengers and crew members who died\". The company's share price fell by more than 6% in Shanghai on Tuesday. ",

            "header": "The global music market was worth $26bn in 2021",
            "content": "Global music revenues grew at the fastest rate in more than two decades last year, with help from artists like BTS, Taylor Swift and Adele. Revenues surged by 18.5% to $25.9bn (£19.5bn) in 2021, the highest level since records began in the 1990s. The growth was driven by streaming, with 523 million paid subscribers, up from 443 million in 2020. Streaming now accounts for 65% of total revenues, with CDs, vinyl and cassettes making up 19% and downloads 4%. The remaining 11% comes from a mixture of royalty payments and licensing music to films, TV shows and adverts. The figures mean the industry has enjoyed a seventh consecutive year of growth, according to trade body the International Federation of the Phonographic Industry (IFPI). \"It's hugely encouraging,\" chief executive Frances Moore told the BBC. \"We lived through that dire period after 1999 where the industry declined by 40%. \"We didn't envisage we'd be in a situation [this year] where we report on 60 or 70 countries and every single one is in growth.\" BTS were the top-selling act in the world last year\nVinyl sales soared again in 2021, thanks to Abba\nAdele and The Weeknd had the biggest hits of 2021 Although streaming is the engine of the industry's recovery, revenues were up in every format except digital downloads last year. Sales of CDs increased for the first time this millennium, and vinyl revenues were up by 51%. Total streaming - including both paid subscriptions and advertising-supported listening - grew and is now worth $16.9bn (£12.75bn) But while the figures are good news for record labels, the independent sector warned that profits were not being shared equally. \"It is good to see continued growth across the global music market... but it serves as an important reminder that not everyone is feeling the benefit,\" said Paul Pacifico of the Association of Independent Music. Without \"clear support\" for up-and-coming musicians, he added, \"it will remain very difficult to reconcile the positive numbers in the market as a whole with the hard reality of making a life in music at an individual, human level\". All of the record labels represented by the IFPI have suspended operations in Russia, the fifth biggest music market in Europe, since the invasion began last month. Although significant, Russia only accounts for 1.3% of global revenues (about $336m), Moore said, meaning the move would have little impact on the global industry. \"We just want to get back to a situation where people in Russia and Ukraine can enjoy music in a peaceful, non-violent environment,\" she added. The UK music industry grew at a slightly slower rate than the global average, with revenues up 12.8% to £1.3bn, according to the BPI - but it remains the third biggest music market in the world, behind the US and Japan. Revenues in the US outpaced the rest of the world, rising by 22%; while lockdown-bound Australia was the world's slowest-growing market, on 3.4%. The IFPI report highlighted the increasingly global nature of music consumption, with artists from Latin America, Africa and Asia featuring among the year's top 100 artists. South Korean band BTS were the biggest-selling act for the second year running after topping the US Billboard chart three times and earning a Grammy nomination for their Michael Jackson-inspired single Butter. \"Who could have imagined that 20 years ago?\" Moore asked. \"It's a phenomenon.\" US songwriter Taylor Swift was the year's second best-seller, the same position she held last year, while Adele came third. Adele's fourth album, 30, was the most popular record overall, selling 4.7 million copies; while The Weeknd's Save Your Tears was the year's biggest single. African artists like Wizkid, Ckay and Burna Boy also had a successful year, encouraged in the UK by the recently-launched Afrobeats chart. \"It's an exciting moment for artists from the continent,\" said Temi Adeniji, managing director of Warner Music South Africa. \"I really do deeply believe that this is a transformative moment for the continent.\" However, she said more needs to be done to reflect the diversity of Africa's musicians. \"The continent is... much more than Afrobeats,\" she said. \"There are so many different genres that we can take a look at that have the potential to do exactly what Afrobeats has done.\" Adeniji cited the global success of Ckay's Love Nwantiti as an example of how other countries are embracing African music. \"We really did break this track in non-English-speaking markets,\" she explained. \"France was the first country in which the song went number one and that was definitely a first for us. \"It's also been a top three hit in the UK, we've gone platinum in the US as well and it's gone, I think, three times platinum in India. We're hoping to replicate that [with other artists] going forward.\" Follow us on Facebook, or on Twitter @BBCNewsEnts. If you have a story suggestion email entertainment.news@bbc.co.uk. ",

            "header": "Inquiry urged amid fears people of colour pay more for car insurance",
            "content": "A charity has called on regulators to investigate following concern that people from ethnic minority backgrounds could pay more for car insurance. Citizens Advice claims its own investigation found people faced a £280 a year \"ethnicity penalty\". Insurers say ethnicity is never a factor when setting premiums, as such discrimination would be illegal. But the City regulator said the investigation raised challenging questions for insurers. The charity analysed 18,000 car insurance costs reported by people across England and Wales who came to Citizens Advice for debt help last year. It concluded that, on average, people from ethnic minority backgrounds paid £250 a year more than white people - regardless of gender, age and income. Using a mystery shopping exercise, it also said that in postcodes where more than 50% of the population were from ethnic minority backgrounds, there was a penalty of at least £280 a year. The charity claimed that local risk factors such as the crime rate, deprivation, road traffic accidents and population density could not account for the price differences. The Association of British Insurers (ABI) said insurers never use ethnicity as a factor when setting prices, to comply with the law. James Dalton, its director of general insurance policy, said: \"All other rating factors being the same, two people of different ethnicities who live in the same postcode will pay the same premium for their car insurance. \"Insurance is priced on individual risk levels and there are many different risk-related factors that are used to calculate the price of a car insurance policy which, as Citizens Advice recognise, should not be looked at in isolation but ethnicity is not one of them. However, we recognise this report raises an important public policy debate.\" New insurance rules mean change in prices\nInsurers plan green replacements for write-offs Citizens Advice said it was concerned that alternative data could be used as a proxy for the ethnicity of customers. Data is processed through complex algorithms which were hard to examine, it said. It called on the City watchdog, the Financial Conduct Authority (FCA), to investigate. \"It is time for the FCA to lift the bonnet on insurance firms' pricing decisions and ensure no one is paying more because of protected characteristics like race,\" said its chief executive, Clare Moriarty. \"The use of algorithms has real-world implications for real people. They must be applied with caution, under the careful scrutiny of regulators.\" An FCA spokesman said: \"We welcome Citizens Advice's work on this important issue. Their analysis highlights a risk of discrimination based on race and raises some potentially challenging questions for insurers. \"Firms must also be able to assure themselves, and us, that any risk factors they include also do not result in discrimination. We will continue to consider any evidence we receive of concerns around pricing.\" ",

            "header": "Post Office scandal: What the Horizon saga is all about",
            "content": "Former Post Office sub-postmasters and mistresses will start giving evidence as part of a public inquiry on the Horizon scandal on Monday. More than 700 branch managers were given criminal convictions when faulty accounting software made it look as though money was missing from their sites. It has been described as the most widespread miscarriage of justice in UK history, with dozens of convictions overturned and many more in line for compensation. Between 2000 and 2014, the Post Office prosecuted 736 sub-postmasters and sub-postmistresses - an average of one a week - based on information from a recently installed computer system called Horizon. Some went to prison following convictions for false accounting and theft, many were financially ruined and have described being shunned by their communities. Some have since died. After 20 years, campaigners won a legal battle to have their cases reconsidered, after claiming that the computer system was flawed. Inquiry to examine Post Office wrongful convictions Horizon was introduced into the Post Office network from 1999. The system, developed by the Japanese company Fujitsu, was used for tasks such as transactions, accounting and stocktaking. Sub-postmasters complained about bugs in the system after it reported shortfalls, some of which amounted to many thousands of pounds. Some sub-postmasters attempted to plug the gap with their own money, even remortgaging their homes, in an (often fruitless) attempt to correct an error. Many former postmasters and postmistresses have described how the saga ruined their lives. They had to cope with the long-term impact of a criminal conviction and imprisonment, some at a time when they had been pregnant or had young children. Marriages broke down, and courts have heard how some families believe the stress led to health conditions, addiction and premature deaths. \"The past nine years have been hellish and a total nightmare. This conviction has been a cloud over my life,\" said former Oxfordshire sub-postmaster Vipinchandra Patel, whose name was cleared in 2020. Seema Misra was pregnant with her second child when she was convicted of theft and sent to jail in 2010. She said that she had been \"suffering\" for 15 years as a result of the saga. In December 2019, at the end of a long-running series of civil cases, the Post Office agreed to settle with 555 claimants. It accepted it had previously \"got things wrong in [its] dealings with a number of postmasters\", and agreed to pay £58m in damages. The claimants received a share of £12m, after legal fees were paid. A few days later, a High Court judgement said that the Horizon system was not \"remotely robust\" for the first 10 years of its use, and still had problems after that. The judge said the system contained \"bugs, errors and defects\", and that there was a \"material risk\" that shortfalls in branch accounts were caused by the system. Following the High Court ruling, more cases were brought forward to the Criminal Cases Review Commission (CCRC), an independent body which investigates suspected miscarriages of justice. In a series of rulings, the convictions of a total of 72 former postmasters have now been overturned, with more expected to go through the courts. This included 39 postmasters' convictions being quashed in a single ruling at the Court of Appeal last April. The judges determined that these 39 convictions were also \"an affront to the public conscience\". That means the postmasters may pursue civil action against the Post Office for malicious prosecution, seeking significant sums in damages. Those whose convictions, based on Horizon evidence, have been overturned will be in line for compensation, which the Post Office has promised as soon as possible. It is inviting applications for interim compensation of up to £100,000, which will be funded by the government. Final settlements will come via mediated agreements, or through claims in the civil courts. The Post Office has set up a separate historic shortfall scheme designed to repay those who lost out, but this has excluded those who were part of the High Court settlement. The government has now said those blocked from the scheme would be compensated \"in parallel\" to those who can use the shortfall programme. More than 2,400 claims have been made to the scheme. Ministers said this was more than the Post Office expected and held the potential for the government having to step in to cover some of the cost. The inquiry set up \"to establish a clear account of the failings of the Horizon IT computer system, and assess whether lessons have been learnt at the Post Office\" was given greater powers to investigate and call witnesses to give evidence. This followed pressure on the government after convictions started to be quashed. It will take into account whether the Post Office knew about faults in the IT system and will also ask how staff shouldered the blame. So far, nobody at the Post Office or Fujitsu has been held accountable, although the High Court judge said he would refer Fujitsu to the Director of Public Prosecutions for possible further action because he had \"grave concerns\" about the evidence of the company's employees.

            "content": "Fuel prices have stabilised for the first time this month after Russia's invasion of Ukraine caused a surge. Average fuel prices slipped from record highs on Monday, with petrol at nearly £1.67 a litre and diesel at £1.79. Crude oil surged to $139 per barrel in the first week of March, then slid back the following week. The RAC said the settling of prices could be an indication that retailers may have \"finished\" passing on their higher wholesale costs to customers. However, it is unclear if and when the cost of fuel will go down. Simon Williams, fuel spokesman for the RAC, said Monday's prices had \"steadied with very slight reductions in both petrol and diesel\". UK fuel prices have increased at the fastest rate on record in recent weeks, with petrol rising 13p since the start of the month and diesel increasing by nearly 21p. How much would cutting fuel duty on petrol save you?\nPetrol prices set to ease after hitting fresh highs Fuel prices, which were already rising as global economies recovered from the coronavirus pandemic, surged after the war in Ukraine pushed up oil prices. Changes in prices at the pump are mainly determined by crude oil prices and the dollar exchange rate, because crude oil is traded in dollars. Russia is one of the world's major oil exporters and it is being targeted by economic and trading sanctions. After Brent crude oil - a global benchmark for prices - hit a near 14-year high of $139 a barrel during the early stages of the conflict, prices fell back to around $100, but have since risen again to $115 on Tuesday. The most recent increase was driven by the European Union discussing a ban on the purchase of Russian oil, which countries in the bloc rely heavily on. Some countries, such as the US and Canada, have already banned on Russian oil imports, but the EU has so far stopped short of that action. Meanwhile, the UK government has vowed to phase out imports of Russian oil by the end of the year. The UK only imports about 6% of its crude oil from Russia, but is affected by the global shifts in price. Mr Williams said the wholesale price of petrol for retailers currently stands at £1.30 a litre for petrol and £1.48 for diesel. \"With prices this high before retailer margin and 20% VAT are added it's clear we are in a tough place when it comes to being able to afford to drive,\" he said. \"This is why it's crucial the chancellor takes decisive and meaningful action in his Spring Statement that helps hard-pressed drivers and businesses.\" More than 50 Conservative MPs have called for a cut in fuel duty, which is currently 57.95p per litre, and has VAT of 20% applied on top. Several newspapers have also reported that Chancellor Rishi Sunak is considering a temporary cut of as much as 5p per litre, but some opposition MPs have questioned whether this would go far enough. Following Russia's invasion of Ukraine, there were warnings of potential global oil supply problems. The International Energy Agency (IEA) has said high commodity prices and sanctions against Russia were \"threatening to create a global oil supply shock\". It estimated three million barrels per day of Russian oil could be taken out of the global market as a result of international sanctions. The agency warned only Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates have enough spare production capacity to offset the shortfall in Russian output. ",

At present, about 900,000 people with disabilities are considered to be in fuel poverty, according to Scope and National Energy Action. If typical domestic bills rise to £3,000 in October, as feared, they said that number could rise to 2.1 million. The government has said it is supporting people facing rising costs. Chancellor Rishi Sunak, who delivers his Spring Statement on Wednesday, has pledged to help \"where we can make a difference\". Disabled woman 'crying for help' over energy costs\nPeople 'facing choice between food and energy' The charities said that people with disabilities often had additional energy needs compared to people without disabilities, as many needed to keep heating on for medical reasons, or use electricity to power vital equipment. \"Disabled people are already facing some extremely difficult choices, and this is only going to get worse in the months ahead unless action is taken now,\" said Mark Hodgkinson, chief executive of Scope, a disability equality charity. Millions of households are facing a 54% rise in the cost of a typical annual gas and electricity bill, to about £2,000, when the regulator's new, higher price cap takes effect on 1 April. The war in Ukraine has pushed up wholesale energy costs, leading to worries that the typical household bill could rise to as high as £3,000 in October, when the cap will be adjusted again. The government has said it is taking \"decisive action\" in helping people with their bills. This includes a £150 council tax rebate for 80% of households, followed by a £200 discount on bills in October which will need to be repaid. National Energy Action, which campaigns for warm and dry homes, has called on the chancellor to allow low-income and vulnerable people an exemption from repaying the £200 grant. Adam Scorer, the charity's chief executive, said: \"As heat prices spiral, it is the most vulnerable who suffer the most. A warm, safe home is an absolute necessity for people with disabilities. The impact of a cold home on their mental and their physical health can be catastrophic. \"The current level of support is woefully inadequate. Government must provide greater financial support, or some of the most vulnerable in society will count the cost in more than just pounds and pence.\" EXPLAINED: Why are energy bills so high?\nPRICES: Cost of petrol hits fresh record\nWARNING: UK faces biggest income squeeze in decades\nAPPEAL: Campaigner says families need urgent help ",

            "content": "The owner of Burger King said the operator of its 800 stores in Russia has \"refused\" to close the sites despite demands to suspend trading. Restaurant Brands said it had contacted local partner, Alexander Kolobov, to shut the shops amid the war in Ukraine. But it said \"complicated\" contracts with overseas partners mean it is unable to \"walk away\" from these deals. Mr Kolobov told the BBC he does not have the \"authority or power\" to stop Burger King operations in Russia. But he said any closure must be approved by all investors in the business. \"The decision to terminate and suspend operations of the franchisee which employs about 25,000 persons must be taken by all shareholders considering impact it may have on the employees and their families,\" he said. Many Western firms have shut or suspended their Russian businesses because of the country's invasion of Ukraine. However a small number, including Burger King and UK retailer Marks and Spencer (M&S), have been unable to do so because their stores are run by franchise partners under \"complex\" legal arrangements. The Western brands unable to leave Russia\nGrowing numbers of firms pull back from Russia In a letter to staff, Restaurant Brands International president David Shear said: \"We contacted the main operator of the business and demanded the suspension of Burger King restaurant operations in Russia. \"He has refused to do so.\" Mr Shear added that making any changes to its local Burger King business \"would ultimately require the support of Russian authorities on the ground and we know that will not practically happen anytime soon\". Burger King entered the Russian market 10 years ago. It trades there through a joint venture partnership with Mr Kolobov - who is the main day-to-day operator of the business - as well as with Russia's VTB Capital and a Ukrainian investment firm. VTB Capital is an affiliate of VTB Bank, Russia's second largest financial institution which has been sanctioned by the US, UK and other European countries. Mr Kolobov said he owns a 30% stake in the joint venture.\"Since the date of the establishment (of) the joint venture-franchisee... my share has always been far below control,\" he said. Mr Shear said Restaurant Brands owns a minority stake of 15% in the Russian joint venture which it is in the process of unwinding. \"While we would like to do this immediately, it is clear that it will take some time to do so based on the terms of our existing joint venture agreement,\" he said. Restaurant Brands has stopped supporting the supply chain, operations and marketing for Russia. It will also reject new pitches for investment and expansion in Russia. Western companies remain under pressure to withdraw from Russia following its attack on Ukraine. On Thursday, a group of four Ukrainian MPs highlighted to UK prime minister Boris Johnson that M&S is still open in Russia. The BBC is not responsible for the content of external sites.\nView original tweet on Twitter MP Alona Shkrum said: \"It is very important to put Putin in isolation and for him to know he will not be getting a handshake from the world, he will not be getting a handshake from business, there will be no support for him because he has killed children in Ukraine.\" Complex franchise agreements have prevented some Western brands from shutting their stores in Russia. They have, however, publicly shunned the country over its invasion of Ukraine. Marks & Spencer stores are operated by a Turkish company called FiBA, which has held the rights to sell the retailer's products across Eastern Europe, since 1999. M&S said it has suspended shipments of its goods to FiBA which runs Marks' 48 stores in Russia. Meanwhile, German carmaker Audi has warned that the war in Ukraine will cause \"tremendous interference\" to supply chains. \"We will see tremendous interference with all the supply chains, not just the chip business, but any supply chains internationally,\" said Audi executive Hildegard Wortmann.

Chloe said she had always been good at saving her money, so when the opportunity arose to go from employee to employer at The Coffee Pot in Dufftown she jumped at the chance. She had held onto most of her wages, aside from spending on basics, and the 19-year-old got the keys last month. She said she hoped to one day expand the business. \"I was working somewhere else and saw this job, it was just weekends I started off doing, and progressed from there,\" Chloe recalled of starting at The Coffee Pot. \"Then last September I was speaking to the owner about having my own café and she said 'you could have this place?' \"So I took the offer. When I got the opportunity I just knew that I had to go for it and see what happens. I just knew I couldn't say no.\" She had saved enough to take it over, and the lease is paid monthly. \"I have always been a good saver. I spent what I needed, like on car insurance,\" Chloe told BBC Scotland as she took some freshly-baked scones out the café oven. \"My mum, a childminder, and dad, a farmer, both have businesses and they have always taught me from a young age that money doesn't grow on trees. So you've got to save it, and work for what you want, and that's what I've done.\" Chloe said the hardest part was proving to be getting her head around all the paperwork. \"My mum and dad are very good and advise me on how I should be doing things. Hopefully when I'm on my feet a bit more I'll be changing a few things.\" She said she has six very good employees of various ages. The café sells breakfasts and lunches as well as coffee and sweet treats. \"We have a lot of regulars,\" she said. \"Everything is made here. Our cakes are very popular - especially the strawberry tarts.\" As for expansion, she said: \"If the opportunity occurs then I definitely would.\" Asked what it is like to be the new owner, she added: \"I don't think I'm too bossy.\" ",

            "content": "The dilution of the grand plan to link up the university cities of Cambridge and Oxford could damage the British economy, business leaders have warned. The \"OxCam Arc\" plans included a rail link, new homes and an expressway, but the expressway was scrapped in 2021. A letter to the government signed by 17 businesses, including AstraZeneca, said the Arc was \"central to the UK's present and future economy\". The government said it was committed to investing in the region. The controversial Arc plans aimed to boost the economies of Cambridge and Oxford, and towns in between including Milton Keynes and Bedford, and help boosts new firms with links to the universities. The expressway had been a key part of infrastructure plans since 2017, and the National Infrastructure Commission said the new road and the East-West Rail project had to \"be built as quickly as possible to unlock land for new homes\", in the area covered by the Arc. But there was opposition from MPs, environmentalists and people living in areas marked out for development. Now the BBC understands that the government has lost interest in the scheme. The Conservative MP for North East Bedfordshire, Richard Fuller, who has opposed the scheme, told BBC Politics East: \"My understanding is that the OxCam Arc has been de-emphasised or flushed away. \"It was a pretext really for additional houses. For the communities to take more housing and for the connectivity to justify one million more homes. \"We are already under too much pressure from housing and that means pressure to get GP appointments or a school place. \"I think the underpinnings of the Arc failed from the start and I hope it is being downplayed.\" Mike Derbyshire, head of planning at property consultants Bidwells who helped organise the letter, said the Arc was vital to free up new developments as companies were crying out for land. \"We have start-up companies and spin-off companies from the universities looking for space,\" he said. \"Then we have corporate firms like Apple, Samsung, Miscrosoft and AstraZeneca, looking for additional space. They can't stay static, so they'll have to look elsewhere.\" Bev Hindle, executive director of the Oxford to Cambridge Arc Leadership Group, said: \"If indeed we are trying to compete globally with places like Boston [USA], we should be backing areas that already have the advantage [of universities and an educated workforce]. \"If we don't have that collaboration, if we don't have that effort to join up, then my worry is that we will still have the acceptance of unsustainable growth - it will still happen, but won't bring our communities with us and the growth won't be in areas where our innovation can change things.\" A Department for Levelling Up spokesman said: \"The East of England is already benefiting from investments to boost living standards, empower local leaders and improve public services. \"The region has also received over £287m across 12 towns through our Towns Fund to support growth, regenerate public spaces and improve transport.\" Politics East airs on BBC One in the East on Sunday, 20 March at 10:00 GMT and can be viewed on the BBC iPlayer afterwards.

            "content": "Millions of people face the dilemma of cutting spending on food and clothing to pay their energy bill, one supplier's boss has said. Bill Bullen, chief executive of Utilita - which serves prepayment meter customers - said government financial support was not directed sufficiently to those who needed it most. He said ministers should spend money on \"insulating the hell out of Britain\". There are growing calls for help on bills ahead of the Spring Statement. On Wednesday, Chancellor Rishi Sunak will deliver the statement - an update on the state of the UK economy, and an opportunity to outline further policies on tackling the rising cost of living. The government is also preparing a UK energy strategy in light of the war in Ukraine and the impact it is having on global supply and prices. Sunak defends response as energy bills soar by £693\nCost of living crisis: Sunak's menu of options Millions of households are facing a 54% rise in the cost of a typical annual gas and electricity bill, to about £2,000, when the regulator's new, higher price cap takes effect on 1 April. The price rise for prepayment meter customers, who can include some of the poorest and most vulnerable in society, is slightly higher. The increase for prepayment meter customers is typically £708 a year. The war in Ukraine has heightened concern about a similar increase in October, when the next cap is set. The government has said it is taking \"decisive action\" in helping people with their bills. This includes a £150 council tax rebate for 80% of households, followed by a £200 discount on bills in October which will need to be repaid. However, Mr Bullen argued that the rise was inadequately focussed, leaving millions of people facing tough choices on their family budgets. \"They just do not have the money,\" he said. He said that the \"path of no regret\" for the government was to find ways to cut energy consumption, and therefore bills, over the long term with a massive home insulation programme. It was relatively easy, he said, to cut consumption by 20%. Some people who agree with the criticism of a non-targeted approach to the government's financial assistance have chosen to donate their £150 council rebate to charities helping those struggling to pay their fuel bills. National Energy Action, which campaigns for warm, dry homes and runs a helpline and hardship funds, said that 40% of its donations in February came from people wishing to donate their rebate. Ahead of the Spring Statement, a string of charities have called on the chancellor to step up support for those struggling to pay their bills, given the rising cost of basics such as food and fuel. The debt charity Christians Against Poverty said calls to its helpline went up by 47% in January compared with the same month last year. It said requests for emergency fuel vouchers had doubled in the first two months of this year compared with the same period last year. As well as a more generous increase in benefit payments, the charity wants the chancellor to announce a full review of the cost of living to ensure everyone has a sufficient income for their basic needs. Citizens Advice estimated that five million people would be unable to afford the April energy price rise. The prospect of more price rises in October could mean that one in four UK adults would be unable to pay their bills. The Joseph Rowntree Foundation argued that the minimum requirement from the chancellor to tackle the cost of living issue was to increase benefits in line with inflation - close to doubling the 3.1% increase set for April.

            "content": "The effects of the war in Ukraine are stretching as far as the Scottish fishing industry, as it faces the loss of lucrative exports. Millions of pounds worth of mackerel and herring cannot be exported due to the conflict, and there are also new tariffs on Russian white fish. Herring and mackerel weighing about 12,000 tonnes is shipped from Scotland to Ukraine and Belarus every year. The war means it cannot arrive, putting a market worth about £20m at risk. Peterhead in Aberdeenshire is the biggest white fish port in Europe. At fish and freezing firm Lunar, lorries should be taking mackerel to Ukraine, however they are not able to get through. Pallets of fish are piled high inside a cold store at -20C. The BBC is not responsible for the content of external sites.\nView original tweet on Twitter Lunar general manager Sinclair Banks said it was an uncertain time. \"At this point in time there are challenges to face, in terms of what do we do with product that is reserved for Ukraine,\" he told BBC Scotland. \"Do we decide that market is now too uncertain to supply, but then there are humanitarian issues. \"The difficulty is deciding whether you hold that stock hoping that things improve and the customers that are in the Ukraine are able to take the product. \"There is also the possibility that government could intervene along with the Ukrainian government and find a way of entry into Ukraine, for what is a vital food source for the Ukrainian people. \"They need to eat.\" It is not just that export market being hit. New tariffs mean firms relying on imported white fish could struggle. Although Peterhead's white fish market is a major player on the European stage, the UK still imports thousands of tonnes of white fish every year from overseas, particularly from Russia. In 2020 the UK imported nearly 50,000 tonnes. That import market is now the subject of the latest round of sanctions. It could see price rises at fish and chip shops - the cost of potatoes, peas and the energy to cook them with have all soared too. \"Like we're seeing as you go to the fuel pump or go to the supermarket, your fish Friday is going to be a whole lot more expensive now,\" said Jimmy Buchan, chief executive of Scottish Seafood Association, which represents processors. \"Such is the demand from the United Kingdom public to eat fish, the amount of fish we land here locally just does not satisfy that need. \"Sanctions for some is going to be very bad. I think for our own fishing fleet I think it will be a help because it may put a bit more demand they need at this time to offset the fuel prices. \"But equally I've got to look at it from the point of view that these factories need a constant supply, they employ a lot of people, and without that supply of raw material they could get into financial difficulty.\" So the impact of tariffs may well soon affect the price of what goes on to dinner plates. And for those who rely on selling fish overseas, difficult decisions lie ahead on whether to wait for a safe route to Ukraine, or sell elsewhere. ",

            "header": "China lockdowns: The economic cost of a zero-Covid policy",
            "content": "War. Inflation. And now, Covid lockdown deja vu in China. It is a perfect storm for the global supply chain - how goods and materials get from other countries to you and me. When disruptions take place in China, it is significant because about a third of the world's entire manufacturing capacity is based in the country. If you're buying something online there's a very good chance it was made in Shenzhen - a city of 17.5 million in the south east where roughly half of all China's online retail exporters are based. So, when Shenzhen went into a six-day lockdown on Sunday after a massive surge in Covid cases, it sent shockwaves through the world's businesses. The restrictions have since widened to other major cities and provinces like Shanghai, Jilin and Guangzhou. Factories had to suspend production, and cities turned into ghost towns. The number of ships waiting at some Chinese ports has already increased, according to project44 which monitors how freight is moving across the world. \"We saw a 28.5% increase in the number of vessels waiting outside of the port of Yantian which is a major export port to Europe and North America,\" says Adam Compain, senior vice president of project44. Yantian is the same port which was shut down due to Covid last year, causing major delivery delays over Christmas. The new measures come at a time when manufacturing output from China was just starting to recover after the Chinese Lunar New Year holidays in February. While China's Covid measures are drastic, however, at least most lockdowns don't last too long. \"It's a double- edged sword,\" says Steven Lynch, managing director at British Chamber of Commerce China. \"China comes down very quickly which causes huge disruptions but then, things will go back to normal relatively quickly.\" Companies also seem to be much better prepared this time. \"We've seen these lockdowns before so companies have put in a robust supply chain management,\" Mr Lynch explains. For example, e-commerce giant Amazon bought more China-based inventory to buffer any potential disruptions during earlier Omicron surges so it doesn't anticipate a significant disruption from the latest measures. \"We are able to counter these closures by diverting available freight to our neighbouring warehouses in the region,\" an Amazon spokesperson told the BBC. Another example is Foxconn which makes iPhones for Apple. It has tried to shift production to other manufacturing sites while resuming production by asking employees to work in a closed loop system - or bubble - on its campus where people live and work. \"For Foxconn, it is probably easier,\" says Dan Wang, chief economist at Hang Seng Bank China. \"But for many of those producers, they have to rely on the shipment of other parts, mostly within the same region so it's really hard to move because the transportation within China can also be disrupted.\" The situation has put renewed spotlight on China's zero-Covid - or virus elimination - strategy. On Thursday, President Xi Jinping said the country would stick to its policy but in a meeting of the country's top leaders, he also emphasised that pandemic measures should not cause economic pain. If China continues with its zero or close-to-zero Covid strategy, it may be China's economy and the global consumers it supplies, who will feel the real pain. There are signs that it is enacting longer term costs, making some companies re-think their positions in the Chinese market. Alvin Ea, chief executive of Singapore's largest container haulage platform, Haulio, believes that the industry has become a lot more resilient, by looking at options other than China. \"A lot of the players have already diversified some of their resources and their plans, not to put all their eggs in one basket,\" he says. \"From a south east Asia standpoint, what we could see potentially is that some of the Vietnamese, Malaysian and Indonesian factories could see an increase in orders.\" Peter Sand, chief analyst at Xeneta agrees. \"Companies' contingency plans include anything from growing their stocks of inventories to setting up production facilities in neighbouring countries, or potentially the more expensive option to bring some manufacturing back close to where their main customers are,\" he says. Michael Hart of the American Chamber of Commerce in China, says a number of its members have been thinking about moving operations, although these are still are very much a minority. \"But of those who've been thinking of moving operations, 22% cited Covid-related restriction last year, and that was up from 5%, the previous year.\" ",

            "header": "Airline giant Delta warns oil increases mean higher ticket prices",
            "content": "Higher oil prices are set to lead to a 10% increase in air fares, according to the boss of one of the world's biggest airlines. Delta Air Lines head Ed Bastian told the BBC the final impact \"really depends where fuel prices settle\". Oil prices have reached 14-year highs after Russia's invasion of Ukraine. Emirates, Japan Airlines and AirAsia are among the big carriers to introduce surcharges on their tickets recently to cover the higher cost of jet fuel. Before the pandemic, in 2019, 200 million customers flew on Delta, making it the world's second biggest airline by passenger numbers. Mr Bastian said that on a domestic US flight the rise in fuel prices \"is probably about $25 on a ticket, that could be anywhere between 5% to 10% at these high levels of oil... and international [flights] will be a bit higher than that\". Delta is planning to introduce fuel surcharges on the international flights which account for about 35% of its business, and increase US ticket prices. Oil price rises due to fears over Russian shortfall\nHow has Ukraine conflict affected petrol prices?\nHow do we replace Russian energy? Jet fuel is one of the biggest costs for airlines. Michael O'Leary, the boss of Europe's biggest carrier Ryanair, said recently that the surge in oil prices would lead to \"materially higher\" airfares this summer. Many airlines try to protect themselves from these changes by buying fuel in advance. Easyjet and British Airways both said recently that they had done so for 60% of their fuel needs this year. This year has seen big fluctuations. At the start of January, Brent crude - the international benchmark for oil - was under $80 a barrel, but it recently reached as high as almost $130 as the US and UK said they would end their use of oil from the world's biggest exporter, Russia. More price swings are likely in the short-term according to the executive director of the International Energy Agency, Dr Fatih Birol. He told the BBC: \"I think the $100 [oil] we are experiencing today may not be the highest level of prices we'll be seeing in the next weeks\". He warns that will be felt across all areas of the global economy, because as well as higher transport costs it will lead to more expensive heating and electricity. That would exacerbate the cost of living crisis many countries are facing. Reports from India suggest it is considering tackling high prices at the petrol pumps by buying discounted Russian oil. Many won't purchase it because of western sanctions, and Dr Birol warned: \"One shouldn't forget that every single dollar for oil going to [the] Russian economy will go back as a tank or as a bullet to Ukrainian people. One shouldn't forget this moral aspect in my view\". Instead he wants Middle Eastern countries including Saudi Arabia to increase oil production. The latest IEA forecast says three million barrels a day of Russian oil could be removed from the market. However, that drop in supply could be offset by a fall in demand from China where Covid has led to new lockdowns. All this unpredictability means Delta does not try to buy its fuel in advance, Mr Bastian said. \"Sometimes you win, and often you lose.\" Instead Delta has the protection of owning its oil refinery in Pennsylvania, although it has been unsuccessful in recent efforts to try to sell it. \"We're thrilled that we have it right now\" says Mr Bastian. The Delta chief is also looking to a future where initiatives to tackle climate change by cutting aviation's carbon emissions mean oil prices are less of a concern. \"The existing fossil fuel and jet fuel technology needs to go, and we need to make those investments for the future towards a sustainable future.\" This means moving towards sustainable fuels such as biofuels or synthetic alternatives made through chemical processes. Mr Bastian says that cost is the big impediment, with the production of such substitutes costing \"three to five times what's in the marketplace today\". The difference will need to be made by governments investing in scaling up production. \"Scale will bring costs down over time, and will bring more capital from private sources into exploration and looking for new technology. This next five years is critical that to make sure we get government support, not just in the US but around the world.\" Returning to profitability after the losses of the pandemic will also help fund the development of new technologies. According to the International Air Transport Association the industry lost more than $51bn last year with global demand 58.4% down on 2019 levels. As Covid restrictions continue to ease, Delta had two record days of sales last week, leading Mr Bastian to be hopeful about the outlook. \"The world is returning to travel and governments have decided that Covid is done.\" \"We're seeing some of our largest bookings we've ever had in our history. And it's not just in the US, it's internationally as well.\" However, he adds that Asia is lagging behind other regions. AirAsia boss calls on governments to open borders\nAir fare rises are unavoidable, warns airline boss\nCoronavirus: Boeing says air travel to recover by 2024 Crucially demand for lucrative business class fares is also returning. It is currently at about 60% of pre-pandemic levels, but Mr Bastian expects this to rise to 70% by the summer. He concedes \"there's forms of business travel that will never return, that are more efficient to handle over video technology\", but adds that leisure travellers are now showing more willingness to splash out on premium services. Last year Delta recorded a pre-tax loss of $3.4bn and the disruption caused by coronavirus at the start of this year means Mr Bastian thinks that will be added to at the start of this year. \"We will lose some money primarily because of Omicron, it's not fuel prices. But I do expect starting in the second quarter and beyond that we'll be profitable.\" You can watch Ed Bastian and Dr Fatih Birol's full interviews on \"Talking Business with Aaron Heslehurst\" this weekend. Viewers in the UK can watch the show at on Saturday and Sunday at 15:30 GMT on the BBC News Channel.

            "content": "Kyiv restaurant the Milk Bar used to charge £12 a meal, now it's producing 500 meals a day for free to help feed the citizens of the Ukrainian capital. The restaurant has not been able to pay its staff since February but it still has 20 people working there. \"We are all just thinking about people and the community right now,\" bakery owner Anna Kozachenko said. Hers is just one of the food businesses stepping up to support Ukrainians following the invasion by Russia. \"I'm not even thinking about the financial losses,\" said Ms Kozachenko. The staff who have stayed with the firm are now working around the clock to deliver meals to the elderly and refugees from invaded areas outside Kyiv. Large food suppliers have provided food to the restaurant for free and have promised to do so for \"as long as it is needed\". The landlord has also suspended rent for the restaurant. The Milk Bar is one of more than 450 restaurants that have transformed their businesses to help feed anyone who needs it following Russia's invasion of Ukraine - people sheltering in bunkers, the elderly unable to leave their home, and those fighting on the front lines. One larger firm, LaFamiglia Group, which has 14 restaurants, a catering business and 17 food markets, has also now switched to providing shelters, food and medical supplies. The business, which made tens of millions in dollars in sales last year, is now providing more than 8,000 snacks and sandwiches and more than 5,000 hot meals each day for free. Owner Mikhail Beylin told the BBC suppliers were providing lots of food for free and the rest was being sold at cost, with them not making a profit from it. The restaurant is using its own money to cover any additional costs. Mr Beylin said the war had made getting food to and from the restaurant \"complicated\" and there are fears that they could run out of supplies. \"Now the supply we get is enough to cover the demand and create a small back-up of products in case we face a scarcity,\" he added. The BBC is not responsible for the content of external sites.\nView original tweet on Twitter \"Our chefs remain in the middle of military zones to provide our people with food.\" \"It's not the time to worry about finances, profits and margins, now is the time for actions that are required of everyone in order to stop further destruction of lives.\" Pizzeria owner Ruslan Buriak has 60 volunteers working around the clock at his kitchens in the central-eastern city of Dnipro, which was first targeted by Russian air strikes last week. The kitchens are producing about 1,000 meals each day for the local population and has been relying on free pasta, oils and meat from local farmers. Like the Milk Bar, Mr Buriak also makes deliveries to elderly people and those unable to leave their homes. \"We have around one week of stock left and the volunteer chefs need money to get buses to work,\" Mr Buriak explained. \"We're like a family now and everyone is doing their best to help.\" One of Ukraine's biggest food producers MHP, which grows and distributes wheat, is helping restaurants to keep going and feed people during the conflict, including Mr Beylin's chain. It employs more than 30,000 workers across Ukraine. It has delivered food to isolated communities across the country, but the invasion means some parts of Ukraine where it would normally sow wheat are now inaccessible. \"If this continues, of course our ability to sow rapidly diminishes, particularly if they (the Russian army) moves into the west of the country where a large part of our operations are based\", MHP boss Dr John Rich told the BBC. This would have an impact which reaches far beyond Ukraine. Some 30% of the world's wheat comes from Ukraine and Russia. The majority of Ukraine's wheat and corn exports went to the Middle East or Africa last year - and disruptions to supply could affect availability in these areas. If grain production is hampered, analysts have warned supplies may struggle to keep up with demand, meaning wheat prices could rise across the globe. In the meantime, the government is doing what it can to help financially. It has restarted support schemes put in place to help restaurants cope with the Covid pandemic. Dr Tymofii Mylovanov, president of the Kyiv School of Economics, expects the government to take a larger role in supporting the country's firms as they switch from making sales and profit to trying to help the country's people survive the war. \"Many restaurants have now run out of money but the government is providing relief and co-ordinating people's demand as we continue into a war economy,\" Dr Mylovanov said. Meanwhile MHP has also appealed for donations to its charitable foundation so it can continue to distribute food. Back in Dnipro, Mr Buriak's landlord has also halted rent, water and electricity bills to help support the pizzeria and people are continuing to volunteer their time for free. Mr Buriak plans to keep feeding Dnipro for as long as stocks remain. \"We will keep going until the end of this situation but no one knows how long this will take.\" ",

            "content": "Fraudsters are masquerading as victims of the war in Ukraine in an attempt to steal money from well-meaning UK residents. Con-artists are also seizing on people's eagerness to help victims of the crisis by creating false charity websites to trick people into donating. One expert said the fraud was \"evil\", but unsurprising given the profile of the conflict. The prevalence of such scams is expected to build in the coming weeks. \"As with every global crisis, we going to see a sharp increase in these scams,\" said fraud protection expert Charlie Shakeshaft. He said three specific scams have started to emerge as fraudsters seek to exploit the situation. The first is a donation scam. Fraudsters blitz people with emails or text messages encouraging them to give money to victims of the war. The messages include a link to a false charity website. The messages may be directed at the numbers of people already on so-called suckers lists, because they have previously been tricked, or are promising targets for fraudsters. The second scam uses emotional posts from fraudsters pretending to be victims of the war asking for money. Thirdly, there is a variation of a common scam in which an individual is supposedly a Ukrainian businessman trying to move money out of the country, and who needs to use a bank account outside the country. In reality, it is a fraudster attempting to steal that volunteer's bank details and drain their account.

The UK's tax authority said it had received 570,000 reports of scam attempts in the last year. Most prevalent at this time of year are texts, emails or calls either offering a \"refund\" or demanding unpaid tax, with victims mistakenly thinking the contact refers to their self-assessment return. Phone calls had become more of an issue recently, HMRC said, with 3,995 reports in January compared with 425 in April 2020. Myrtle Lloyd, HMRC's director general for customer services, said: \"If someone contacts you saying they are from HMRC, wanting you to transfer money or give personal information, be on your guard.\" She urged people not to be rushed, and to double check via a dedicated page on the government website.

            "header": "Fears Russia will not be able to pay its debts remain",
            "content": "Russia has claimed it has made a key interest payment to international investors and avoided a debt default. Western sanctions were imposed on Russia in the wake of its invasion of Ukraine, freezing its access to its foreign currency reserves. Russia says it has made $117m payments on two dollar-denominated bonds, but investors have not yet reportedly been paid. If the payments are not made by 30 April, then Russia would be in default. In announcing that Russia had made the debt payment, Russian finance minister Anton Siluanov said he was not sure if money would go through because of sanctions. \"We have the money, we have made the payment, now the ball is in the court, primarily, of the American authorities.\" The US Treasury Department has said that current sanctions would not stop Russia from paying this bill. Despite the confusion, if the debt is not ultimately paid by the end of the 30-day grace period, then Russia will have defaulted on its debts. Credit ratings agencies have warned that a Russian debt default is \"imminent\". The Russian government - and firms such as Gazprom, Lukoil and Sberbank - owe about $150bn to overseas investors. Most of this is in either dollars or euros, and interest and repayments must be made in those currencies. But sanctions imposed after Russia's invasion of Ukraine mean it has lost access to a large proportion of its $630bn (£470bn) in foreign currency reserves. However, it still receives dollars for the oil, gas and other things it sells abroad, and that foreign currency is accessible. If Russia does default, it would be its first debt default since 1998. It would also be its first default on a foreign-currency debt since the 1917 revolution when the new Bolshevik government refused to recognize the debts of the last tsar. Russia could try to pay in roubles. Its foreign ministry has said it would pay international investors in roubles if it were stopped from paying them in dollars or euros. Most of Russia's debts need to be paid in dollars or euros, but debt agreements do allow for different currencies to be used - in which case paying in roubles could be acceptable. This would depend on whether the rouble payment was judged to be the same value as the original dollar or euro amount investors were expecting. Investors in Russia have seen the value of their investments slump in recent days. The problem for many will have been the swiftness of Russia's fall from financial grace, which has left them with little time to react by selling-off their holdings. Credit ratings agency Moody's says that in its 21-point ratings scale, which indicates how reliable a country is as a place to invest, Russia's rating is at its second-lowest, and could fall still further. Moody's says this rating means that it expects Russia to default, and that it is warning investors in Russia that they could lose between 35% and 65% of their money. The last time Russia defaulted - in 1998 - it sent shocks through the financial markets. A default now would be hugely symbolic but is \"unlikely to have significant ramifications,\" says Capital Economics chief economist William Jackson. The IMF has said it will downgrade its forecast of 4.4% global economic growth in 2022 as a result of the war. However, IMF head Kristalina Georgieva has also discounted the idea of a wider shock to the global financial system from a Russian default. But she warned that the sanctions imposed on Russia would lead to a \"deep recession\" there, and that the war would drive up global food and energy prices. The unknown factor, as yet, is what debt defaults there may be by Russian firms - and what impact these may have on overseas investors who have heavily invested in Russia. Any debt default is likely to exacerbate Russia's financial and economic problems. Before it invaded Ukraine, Russia was considered one of the most creditworthy countries in the world, with low debt levels. But things have dramatically changed. Foreign firms have left in droves, and Moscow has already imposed strict credit controls to limit the outflow of money in order to protect its economy and the rouble. Despite this, Russia's economy is set to shrink 7% this year as a result of sanctions. Inflation in February was already 9.15% before the invasion of Ukraine. It is now forecast to surge significantly this year - despite Russia's central bank raising interest rates from 9.5% to 20%. ",

            "header": "How the interest rate rise might affect you",
            "content": "Global uncertainty is having a direct effect on our finances in the UK, with prices rising and businesses juggling pressure from various issues. The impact of the war in Ukraine has an impact on petrol prices and the cost of everyday items. The economic uncertainty it creates is also making the Bank of England's decisions on rates trickier. The idea of raising interest rates is to keep those current and predicted price rises, measured by the rate of inflation, under control. In the face of global upheaval, this may be a relatively blunt tool. All eyes will be on the Bank's long-term strategy. For now, policymakers have increased interest rates to 0.75% from 0.5%, the third rate rise in four months. How high could UK interest rates go? Higher interest rates make borrowing more expensive. For households, that could mean higher mortgage costs, although - for the vast majority of homeowners - the impact is not immediate, and some will escape it entirely. An improvement on savings rates is likely to be far outweighed by the falling value of money put away. Recent years have seen an extraordinary period of cheap mortgages but, even before the Bank of England's rate-setting Monetary Policy Committee began increasing interest rates in December, there were signs that the era of ultra-low mortgage rates was at an end. Some lenders have raised rates for those applying for a new home loan. However, brokers have predicted any rises in mortgage rates to be \"slow and measured\", which would mean mortgages would stay cheap by historical standards for some time. It is a little-discussed fact that only about a third of adults have a mortgage. About a third rent their home, another third have either never had a mortgage or have paid it off. Those figures come from the English Housing Survey, which is geographically limited, but one of the most comprehensive guides available. Some 74% of mortgage borrowers in the UK are on fixed-rate deals, so would only see a change in their repayments when their current term ends, according to banking trade body UK Finance. About 1.5 million fixed-rate deals will expire this year, and another 1.5 million will do so in 2023. Of the remainder, 850,000 homeowners are on tracker deals, and the other 1.1 million are on standard variable rates (SVRs). They are the people likely to feel an immediate impact now the Bank rate has risen. The increase in the Bank rate to 0.75% means a typical tracker mortgage customer's monthly repayment will go up by £25.76. The typical SVR customer is likely to pay £15.96 more a month, UK Finance figures show. This is on top of similar rises in previous months. What are interest rates and why do they matter?\nUK prices rise at fastest rate in 10 years That means a further squeeze on household budgets at a time of rising bills and when people have been used to years of cheap borrowing and relatively slow-rising prices. Every mortgage applicant since 2014 would have needed to prove in a stress test that they can pay at a rate of about 6% or 7% - the idea being that a small rate rise may be uncomfortable, but not unmanageable, for homeowners. However, the Bank of England is planning to drop this requirement, with a consultation on the proposal closing in May. Any improvement in savings rates will have a very limited impact on the value of money tucked away, given that the spending power of these funds is being eaten away by inflation. Analysts warn that there is no guarantee of the higher Bank rate being reflected in better returns on savings. Savers are often borrowers too, but the money in the bank has effectively been falling in value for some time. Anna Bowes, of website Savings Champion, says it is \"really disappointing\" how slow a lot of providers have been to react to the Bank of England's base rate rises. People are receiving pennies in interest for every £100 they keep in savings for a year. A Bank rate rise will do little to change that scenario. The average interest rate for an easy-access account you can open today is 0.2%, up from 0.17% in December. For easy-access accounts closed to new customers, it is 0.26%, up from 0.22%. The highest paying easy-access account has an interest rate of 0.84%, up from 0.71% in December. In the past five years, the best easy access savings rate on the market was in September 2019, which paid 1.6%. ",

In the three months to the end of February, retail sales for the online grocer fell 5.7% to £574.7m. It said the return to the office by workers and the \"euphoria\" of going back out to restaurants after restrictions eased had reduced demand. Rising costs and changing shopping habits saw the group cut its sales forecast for the year. It now expects annual retail revenue growth \"closer to 10%\", rather than in the mid-teens, as it said last month. But the results for its latest quarter also reflected a tough comparison from a year before, when the UK was in lockdown, Ocado added. Worst to come for food price rises - Tesco\nShop prices rise at fastest rate in a decade \"The main thing that we're seeing [now] is people's willingness to behave more like they did pre-Covid,\" Ocado said. \"We've got two off-setting things at the moment though, where some people are still working from home several days a week- and that is a 'basket booster'. \"But that is getting offset by a bit of euphoria about that fact we can go back out to a restaurant, having been cooped up for two years [during Covid-related restrictions].\" Compared with pre-pandemic levels, Ocado's retail sales in the quarter were up 31.7%. \"The last quarter has been encouraging for Ocado Retail despite the clearly evident challenges the industry and consumers are facing,\" said Melanie Smith, Ocado Retail's boss. \"As we have seen since the end of Covid restrictions, the value of the average basket and shape of the week continue to normalise as we return towards the rhythm of our pre-Covid lives.\" Although it saw a 15% drop in the average customer's basket size, Ocado said it was encouraged by an increase in the number of new shoppers on the platform. But the retailer acknowledged that war in Ukraine and uncertainty over how demand will change during the cost of living crisis meant it was difficult to predict sales. It said it had increased the prices of some products already \"where costs could not be mitigated\". However, it is not yet seeing price rises as high as the current rate of inflation, which stands at 5.5% - the highest level seen in 30 years. The group also insisted that it was a \"price follower\", which tries to match the prices of its big competitors. Tesco's chairman warned recently that \"the worst is yet to come\" on rising food prices. John Allan told the BBC he was aware people were on very tight budgets and having to choose between food and heating \"troubles us\", but added that grocers and suppliers were not immune from rising energy costs. Ocado noted that it might be affected by rising energy costs in particular, due to the amount required to power the refrigerators in its distribution hubs and fuel required for its drivers. Separately, online delivery giant Deliveroo reported that its losses have deepened as the costs of its rapid expansion stack up. The company posted a £298m pre-tax loss for the year, compared with a £213m loss in 2020, but stressed that it had a long-term plan for profitability. It said its heavy losses for the past year were driven by big investments in marketing and technology improvements as it sought to keep up the momentum of orders being boosted during lockdowns, similar to Ocado. In its UK business, order numbers increased by 72%. But it also predicted a slowdown in growth over the coming year. Susannah Streeter, senior markets analyst at Hargreaves Lansdown, said: \"For now it does appear that some pandemic habits are sticking around, with restaurant deliveries staying popular, on-call groceries increasingly in demand and a growing source of revenue for Deliveroo. \"But the cost-of-living squeeze is intensifying and as savings are eaten away, there may be less appetite to pay for an easier life.\" ",

Malcolm Michaels said it was \"heartbreaking\" to move from Leeds Kirkgate Market after such a long time. Mr Michaels said he now paid about £10,000 a month in rent, a price he said was no longer sustainable. Leeds City Council, which runs the market, said in the past 18 months it had supported traders with rent concessions equating to about £1m. Mr Michaels, who has worked at the stall in Kirkgate Market since he was 14 years old, said it was \"breaking\" him to leave the market after four decades there. \"I can't see a future in this position,\" he said. The butcher said while he was sad to close his market stall, which employed 16 staff, he was about to open new branches in the centre of Leeds and in Cross Gates. \"Many of our customers have said they'll keep shopping with us after the move,\" he said. \"My focus is on financial security for the younger generation and staying committed to my staff.\" In a statement, Leeds City Council said rents on a single unit at Kirkgate Market ranged from £2,000 to a maximum of £34,314, excluding service charges.

            "header": "Diesel rises again to hit a record £1.76 a litre",
            "content": "Diesel prices in the UK rose by an average of more than 2p in a day as Russia's invasion of Ukraine continues to affect global oil costs. The fuel jumped to a record £1.76 per litre on Tuesday, up from almost £1.74 on Monday. Petrol prices, which have also increased to record highs, rose to almost £1.65p a litre from about £1.64. The continuing price rises come amid warnings of potential global oil supply problems. Recent rises in the global price of oil has pushed up prices at the pumps in the UK, but there are hopes recent falls will transfer to cheaper fuel. Simon Williams, fuel spokesman for the RAC, said drivers could save almost 4p a litre by buying their fuel at one of the big four supermarkets, where the average for petrol is 161p and 171p for diesel. \"We continue to remain hopeful that retailers will soon start to pass on recent reductions in the price of wholesale fuel to drivers when they next buy supply. That ought to lead to petrol stabilising at around 160p while diesel ought to stay where it is based on current wholesale prices,\" he said. The British Retail Consortium (BRC), whose members include major supermarkets which sell fuel, has said retailers understand the cost pressures facing motorists. Andrew Opie, of the BRC, said they would do everything they could to offer the best value-for-money across petrol forecourts. How has Ukraine conflict affected petrol prices? The International Energy Agency (IEA) said high commodity prices and sanctions against Russia for its invasion of Ukraine were \"threatening to create a global oil supply shock\". It estimated three million barrels per day of Russian oil could be taken out of the global market as a result of international sanctions. The agency warned only Saudi Arabia and United Arab Emirates have enough spare production capacity to offset the shortfall in Russian output, which it said was the largest oil exporter in the world. Russia continues to export oil for the time being due to deals and trades made before Moscow sent its troops into Ukraine, the IEA said. New business has all but dried up, however, because many Western countries are seeking alternative fuel supplies. Some countries, such as the US and Canada, have banned Russian oil imports, but by contrast, the EU, which is much more reliant on Russian energy, has stopped short of a ban. Meanwhile, the UK has said it will phase out imports of Russian oil in response to Russia's actions by the end of the year. Prime Minister Boris Johnson has travelled to discuss energy security and other issues in Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates. The IEA said the world was \"faced with what could turn into the biggest supply crisis in decades\", with global energy markets \"at a crossroads\". It added the \"implications of a potential loss of Russian oil exports to global markets\" could not be understated. \"Russia's invasion of Ukraine has brought energy security back to the forefront of political agendas as commodity prices surge to new heights. While it is still too early to know how events will unfold, the crisis may result in lasting changes to energy markets,\" it said. The price of Brent crude oil - the global benchmark for prices - hovered around $100 per barrel on Wednesday, having previously reached record highs of more than $130 a barrel in the immediate aftermath of Western countries hitting Russia with sanctions. The UK only imports about 6% of oil from Russia, but is affected by the global shifts in price which are driven by supply and demand forces. RAC fuel spokesman Mr Williams said UK fuel prices had increased at the fastest rate on record, with petrol rising 13p since the start of the month and diesel increasing by nearly 21p. He said a full tank of unleaded for a family car was now almost £91 on average. UK motoring groups have said fuel prices are likely to fall as global oil prices stabilise. Yet, there is a concern some retailers might be reluctant to lower their prices for fear of being caught out if wholesale costs jump back up again. \"The big question is how keen will retailers be to pass on those savings at the pumps as they will no doubt be extremely conscious of protecting themselves from any more rises that could suddenly materialise,\" said Mr Williams. \"Drivers badly need a break from these relentless daily rises.\" The RAC has called on the chancellor to cut fuel duty or VAT in his upcoming Spring Statement.

            "content": "An estimated 10 million employees have access to discount shopping schemes through work but may rarely use them, research suggests. Nearly two in five employers (38%) told consultants LCP they offered retail discount perk schemes to their staff. With the cost of living rising at its fastest rate for decades, LCP says more people should use these offers. It suggested that some may consider the savings too small, but money off groceries could build up over time. Heidi Allan, senior consultant at LCP, said: \"Many workplaces offer employee discount schemes which give savings on everyday purchases with household name businesses, such as supermarkets, coffee shops, mobile phone companies and travel businesses. \"Yet in some cases workers may not be aware of the scheme or may think it is not relevant to them. The truth is that we are all going to face a squeeze on our budgets in the coming months and every penny we can save is going to help.\" EXPLAINED: Why are energy bills so high?\nWARNING: UK faces biggest income squeeze in decades\nAPPEAL: Campaigner says families need urgent help Food prices have been rising and are set to rise further, and some employers offer schemes giving a small percentage discount on reloadable shopping cards, or loyalty points. People may have to sign up to gift cards and vouchers and get into the habit of using them, but LCP suggests savings over time could be helpful to family finances. Its survey suggested another 27% of employers were considering introducing such schemes in the next 12 months. The government-backed Money and Pensions Service, which runs the MoneyHelper website, has encouraged employers to review their employee assistance plans. The schemes included can range from help with commuting costs to insurance, with the cost often taken out of pre-tax pay. Maddy Alexander-Grout, chief executive of Southampton-based My VIP Rewards, said: \"The sheer level of uncertainty is making consumers exceptionally cautious at present. Many businesses just aren't proactive enough with perks and right now, with the cost of living squeeze, the value they can provide to employees can make a real difference.\" How are you affected by the increase in the cost of living?

            "header": "The Western brands unable to leave Russia",
            "content": "The invasion of Ukraine has led many Western brands to shun Russia, but some still have outlets open in the country and say they are not able to shut them. Marks and Spencer, Burger King, and hotel groups Marriott and Accor are restricted by complex franchise deals preventing them from withdrawing. The firms have outsourced the Russian businesses to third parties and do not own the operations bearing their name. Together the firms have almost a thousand outlets still open in Russia. M&S has 48 shops and Burger King has 800 restaurants still open, whilst Marriott and Accor have 28 and 57 hotels open respectively. The BBC understands the brands are locked into legal franchise agreements, making it difficult for them to remove their name from Russia's High Streets and shopping malls. A lot of Western firms have held such agreements for decades. For example, Marks and Spencer stores have been operated by a Turkish company called FiBA, which has held the rights to sell the retailer's products across Eastern Europe, since 1999. The retail giant has said it has suspended shipments of its goods to FiBA in response to the war. Meanwhile, Burger King's owner Restaurant Brands International also told the BBC its restaurants are run by franchisees. These \"long-standing legal agreements are not easily changeable in the foreseeable future,\" it said. It is understood hotel groups Marriott, IHG and French chain Accor, which has Ibis and Novotel among its brands, are all operating in Russia under similar deals. Marriott told the BBC its hotels in Russia were owned by third parties but said it would \"continue to evaluate the ability for these hotels to remain open\", suggesting it was looking into its franchise agreements. Franchising is a business method of distributing products or services. It involves a franchisor, a company which has established the brand's name, and a franchisee, a company which pays a fee for the right to do business under the franchisor's name and sell its products. Graeme Payne, a specialist in UK and international franchising at law firm Bird&Bird, told the BBC franchising was useful to Western brands who want to enter markets in different countries, but do not have local knowledge, money, or ability to enter them. Growing numbers of firms pull back from Russia \"You would as a member of the public… think why don't they just close their stores? But just from a pure business and contractual perspective, it's very difficult to do so without some far reaching legal consequences,\" said Mr Payne. Those consequences could have serious financial implications for Western businesses, who could be sued by franchisees if they did break any agreement, which are often 10 or more years long. Victoria Hobbs, a partner at Bird&Bird who deals with franchise disputes, told the BBC if a franchise owner was found to have links to Russian President Vladimir Putin or had been sanctioned, then from a UK perspective, a deal could be terminated. However, Ms Hobbs said although agreements often have a clause that states \"if the franchisee is doing something to damage our reputation we can terminate\", the problem currently in Russia is that many franchisees themselves are not doing anything wrong. \"It is quite challenging for them because, from an English law perspective, they don't really have a right to bring the agreement to an end - that's the problem,\" she said. Even if a brand managed to succeed in getting a UK court judgment against a franchise in Russia, \"the Russian courts wouldn't enforce it\", according to John Pratt, a partner at the largest team of specialist franchise lawyers in Europe. In the meantime, the firms are trying to do what they can to help with the situation and all have announced support for Ukraine following Russia's invasion. Accor, which has 57 branded hotels in Russia and 3,500 employees there, has suspended all future hotel openings and has stopped services and distribution to hotels affected by sanctions.\nBurger King is redirecting its profits from franchised operations in Russia to humanitarian efforts\nMarriott and IHG Hotels & Resorts, which each have 28 hotels operating in Russia under their brand, have also halted hotel developments and investments and have closed their corporate offices - which they own themselves and so have control over - in Moscow\nM&S has pledged more than £1.5m to support refugees and is donating 20,000 coats and thermals However, while many brands are stuck in Russia, Yum Brands, which owns KFC and Pizza Hut, said it was finalising an agreement with its main franchisee to temporarily halt Pizza Hut operations. Ms Hobbs, partner at law firm Bird&Bird said she believed brands were \"very worried\" about any potential reputational damage from continuing to operate in Russia. \"They are worried obviously on a human and moral level about what is happening, but I also think they are worried [that] a number of companies have been threatened with boycotts.\" ",

            "content": "The owner of KFC and Pizza Hut said sales plunged by 20% in the first two weeks of March as a surge of new Covid cases spread across China. Yum China said \"the situation has rapidly deteriorated\" as regional lockdowns have been put in place to stem the outbreak. More than 1,100 of its stores are temporarily closed or offering takeaway and sales are \"still trending down\". China's lockdowns are among its biggest since the beginning of the pandemic. They include the Jilin province - home to companies such as carmakers Toyota and Volkswagen - as well as technology hub Shenzhen as the number of new infections of the Omicron variant of Covid rise. Yum China said: \"Entering March, the situation has rapidly deteriorated with the highly transmissible Omicron variant causing outbreaks across China, including economically important regions of Guangdong, Shanghai, Shandong and Jilin.\" It added: \"Our operations are significantly impacted by the latest outbreaks and the tighter public health measures which resulted in a further reduction of social activities, travelling and consumption.\" Businesses shut as China widens Covid lockdowns\nKFC faces boycott in China over meal toy promotion Toyota, Volkswagen and iPhone-maker Foxconn have been forced to close operations in affected regions due to lockdowns. Although Foxconn said on Wednesday it was able to restart some production in Shenzhen after putting in place a closed loop system on its campus. It means that Foxconn employees working in the space cannot move outside the group. Foxconn said: \"This process, which can only be done on campuses that include both employee housing and production facilities, adheres to strict industry guidelines and closed-loop management policies issued by the Shenzhen government.\" There are concerns the restrictions could have an impact on global supply chains. But Yum China's chief executive Joey Wat, said: \"Our robust supply chain management has shielded us from material business disruptions.\" Yum China said it had more than doubled the number of stores it had closed or restricted to take-out services from 500 in January to 1,100 in March. Ms Wat pledged: \"We will keep our restaurants open and provide food services to customers wherever it is possible and safe to do so.\" Restaurateur Birol Dincli, who owns three steakhouses in Shenzhen's Futian district, expects the situation to be even worse this time around compared to when the Covid pandemic began in 2020. All restaurants in the Futian business district have been ordered to close. But they are also barred from offering takeaway or delivery services during the lockdown, said Mr Dincli. \"What you see is a ghost city,\" he told the BBC. \"Everything is shut.\" Although the lockdown in Shenzhen is set to end on 20 March, Mr Dincli reckons it will go on for much longer. He has asked some of his 30 employees to return to their hometowns to wait out the surge. \"In 2020, we faced the same problem so they are understanding. We motivate them to just wait and (be on) standby,\" he said. \"Let's see what will happen and then we will keep going.\" All 24 million residents of the north-eastern Jilin province were placed under quarantine orders on Monday. People are banned from moving around and anyone wanting to leave the province must apply for police permission. In the Jilin city of Changchun, residents must stay at home. Only one person from each household is allowed to leave to buy food and other necessities every two days. Some 12.5 million people living in Shenzhen - dubbed China's Silicon Valley - are also living under a five-day lockdown. Businesses in many of the affected regions have closed or are having their employees work from home. ",

            "content": "The Church of England is putting pressure on TotalEnergies over its decision not to cut business ties with Russia in the wake of its Ukraine invasion. The church's investment funds said they would reconsider their shareholding in the French energy giant. The two funds also called for the firm to urgently review its decision. TotalEnergies has condemned Russia's aggression, but has not followed BP and Shell in withdrawing from Russia. The company did not respond to a request for comment. It was not immediately clear how large a stake the Church of England's Pensions Board and the Church Commissioners investment fund hold in TotalEnergies. They did not respond to requests for comment. In a joint letter to TotalEnergies chief executive, Patrick Pouyanne, the pension board and the Church Commissioners for England noted the company was at odds with the actions taken by many of its peers. Last month, the church's pensions board and the Church Commissioners fund dumped £20m worth of investments in Russian businesses. They also banned any further investments in the country. In a statement to The Times, the church said it made the move \"in response to the attack on Ukraine by Russia and supporting the sanctions announced by the UK and other governments\". The Church Commissioners manage a £9.2bn investment fund while the pensions board oversees a fund worth £3.7bn. In February, the Archbishop of Canterbury Justin Welby and the Archbishop of York Stephen Cottrell said Russia's \"horrific and unprovoked attack on Ukraine is an act of great evil\". The church's letter to TotalEnergies comes after two French NGOs - Greenpeace France and Les Amis de la Terre (Friends of the Earth) France - said they planned to take legal action against the oil giant over possible human rights abuses unless it cuts its business ties with Russia. Russia represented 24% of TotalEnergies' reserves and 17% of its combined oil and gas production in 2020, company documents show. Activist investor Clearway Capital has also written to the board of TotalEnergies asking it to exit its operations in Russia after its invasion of Ukraine. ",

            "content": "Motoring groups have called for fuel prices to fall as the cost of crude oil fell to its lowest level for two weeks. The price of Brent crude - the global benchmark for prices - dropped below $100 a barrel for the first time since the start of March. The RAC has said it is \"vital\" that fuel retailers start passing on falling wholesale prices to consumers. Petrol prices hit another record high on Monday, meaning it costs more than £90 to fill a family car, the RAC said. The average price of a litre of petrol rose to 163.71p on Monday, and diesel also hit a fresh record of 173.68p. Oil prices soared after Russia invaded Ukraine, with the price of Brent crude oil hitting a near 14-year high at one point. But in the past few days, the price of oil has dropped due to a number of factors, including hopes of progress in ceasefire talks between Russia and Ukraine, and also expectations that demand from China will ease as Covid cases there surge. Brent crude fell to about $98 a barrel on Tuesday before recovering some ground. RAC fuel spokesman Simon Williams said that although petrol prices were at record highs, drivers \"should be encouraged\" by the fall in oil and wholesale prices. \"It's now vital that the biggest retailers who buy fuel most often start to reflect these reductions at the pumps to give drivers a much-needed break from the pain of constantly rising prices,\" he added. How has Ukraine conflict affected petrol prices?\nPetrol prices set to ease after hitting fresh highs\nFuel price jump will hit food bills, industry says The AA said that the wholesale price of petrol has plummeted by 12.8p a litre since Wednesday. Luke Bosdet from the AA said: \"We should be seeing these record prices level off and start to fall away later this week. If not, MPs who are being deluged by complaints from angry constituents, need to be asking questions in Parliament. \"The government is under intense pressure from the cost of living crisis. They don't need the fuel trade to 'feather' a potential drop in pump prices.\" Andrew Opie from the British Retail Consortium said supermarket retailers \"understand the cost pressures\" facing motorists, and will do \"everything they can to offer the best value-for-money across petrol forecourts, particularly if the price of oil falls\". The Petrol Retailers Association, which represents independent forecourts, said it would expect prices to fall when fresh stock is delivered. Gordon Balmer, the PRA's Executive Director, said forecourts bought from suppliers based on a price with one or two days' lag, or in some cases a week's lag. This means it can take a few days for wholesale prices to filter through to the pumps. Oil prices are mainly determined by the price of crude oil and the dollar exchange rate, as agreements are made in dollars. Russia is the third largest oil exporter and some Western countries, for example the US and Canada, decided to halt imports from the country in response to Russia's actions. It means demand for oil from other producers has increased, leading to increased prices. The UK only imports about 6% of oil from Russia, so is not as dependent on Russia for the commodity supply as other European countries are and has said it plans to phase it out. It is, however, affected by the global shifts in price. On Monday, some analysts told MPs on the Treasury Committee that they expected the recent fall in the oil price to be temporary. Nathan Piper, head of oil and gas research at financial services company Investec, said further restrictions on Russian oil exports would mean consumers \"need to get ready for what could be continued increases in fuel prices.\" Dr Amrita Sen, director of research at Energy Aspects, told the committee that petrol prices could rise to around £2.40 a litre. And that diesel prices of \"£2.50 - even closer to £3\" were \"definitely in the realms of possibility\". Energy Minister Greg Hands has said the UK's transition to cleaner forms of energy production is now \"an issue of national security\" and not just of decarbonisation. ",

            "content": "Germany's cyber-security authority has warned against using anti-virus software from Russian headquartered company Kaspersky. The Federal Office for Information Security (BSI) issued the statement in light of the conflict in Ukraine. Russian information-technology businesses could be spied on or forced to launch cyber-attacks, it said. Kaspersky told BBC News the warning had been \"made on political grounds\" and it had no ties to the Russian government. The BSI made no allegation of current problems with Kaspersky's products but said the conflict in Ukraine and Russian threats against the European Union, Nato and Germany brought with them the risk of cyber-attacks. \"A Russian IT manufacturer can carry out offensive operations itself, be forced against its will to attack target systems, or be spied on as a victim of a cyber operation without its knowledge or as a tool for attacks against its own customers,\" the warning said. The BSI recommends Kaspersky anti-virus products are replaced with alternatives - but carefully, to avoid weakening defences. In 2017, President Donald Trump signed legislation banning Kaspersky software's use within the US government The same year, UK's National Cyber Security Centre announced it would write to all government departments, warning against using Kaspersky products for systems related to national security. Following the BSI's warning, Eintracht Frankfurt football club spokesman Axel Hellmann told Bloomberg: \"We have notified Kaspersky management that we are terminating [our] sponsorship agreement effective immediately. \"We very much regret the development.\" Kaspersky said it would seek clarification from the BSI on its decision, which was \"not based on a technical assessment of Kaspersky products\", and how to address its concerns. As a private global cyber-security company it \"does not have any ties to the Russian or any other government\". Its data-processing infrastructure had been relocated to Switzerland in 2018 And \"the security and integrity of our data services and engineering practices have been confirmed by independent third-party assessments\". \"We believe that peaceful dialogue is the only possible instrument for resolving conflicts,\" it said. \"War isn't good for anyone.\" Similar remarks by founder Eugene Kaspersky two weeks ago attracted strong criticism.

            "header": "Cost of living: 'My pay isn't keeping up with rising prices'",
            "content": "UK wage growth failed to keep up with the rising cost of living between November and January, new figures show. Wages rose, but when taking rising prices into account, regular pay showed a 1% fall from a year earlier, the Office for National Statistics said. Gamu Nyasoro, a senior registered nurse, told the BBC that despite a recent pay rise, she has barely noticed a difference in her income after bills. There is concern the Ukraine war will further push up energy and food bills. The new employment figures also show that the number of jobless people in the UK has dropped below pre-pandemic levels. The ONS said there were 1.34 million unemployed in the three months to January, below the 1.36 million recorded in December to February 2020. The unemployment rate fell to 3.9% in the most recent quarter, while job vacancies hit another record high. But according to the ONS, employees' regular pay, excluding bonuses, grew by 3.8% between November and January from a year earlier. However, the rising cost of food, energy and household goods has pushed inflation, which measures how the cost of living changes over time, to a 30-year high. Prices surged by 5.5% in the 12 months to January, up from 5.4% in December, increasing pressure on household budgets. The Resolution Foundation think tank has warned that the squeeze on workers will get worse, with those on the lowest incomes most likely to be affected by surging bills. Why are prices rising so quickly?\nBorrow billions or see incomes hit, Sunak told\nFury after Bank boss says don't ask for big pay rise The ONS said its latest figures showed the number of unemployed people fell below pre-pandemic levels for the first time, while there was another strong rise in the number of pay-rolled employees in February. Grant Fitzner, chief economist at the ONS, added: \"However, the number of people out of work and not looking for a job rose again, meaning total employment remained well below its pre-pandemic level. \"We have seen yet another record number of job vacancies, and with the redundancy rate falling to a new record low, demand for workers remains strong.\" The ONS said early estimates for February 2022 indicated that median monthly pay was £2,041, an increase of 5.1% compared with the same period last year. \"The issue is not that pay growth is weak, it's that prices are running even higher,\" Mr Fitzner told the BBC's Today programme. Recent research by the Institute for Fiscal Studies suggested that public sector workers in particular are facing pay cuts once rising prices are taken into account. Gamu Nyasoro, says her pay rise is barely noticeable once increasing council tax, energy and food bills are taken into account. As a single mother to three children, a lot of her outgoings are spent on childcare. \"I look at my pay cheque and you literally want to cry because you know that by day two, the things that you need to pay have gone out and you are literally left with no money.\" She says finances are now a constant worry. Her forecast energy bill for the next year has nearly doubled. She was recently also forced to use a foodbank for the first time. \"It was one of the most scariest thing that I've done and something that I didn't do lightly.\" You can't sugar-coat this. It's been widely predicted that living standards would fall as a result of rising inflation. Before inflation, the average pay rise was 3.8% excluding bonuses - substantially more than most workers have been used to over the past decade. However, because prices are now rising faster than that, the average wage (now £555 per week) can buy fewer goods and services than a year ago. After allowing for inflation, it amounts to a real terms pay cut of 1% across the board. That average hides a growing gap between the private sector, where bonuses have lifted total pay by 5.3% including bonuses, enough to keep up with the rising cost of living, and the public sector, where total pay rose by only 2.4% and living standards are falling more sharply. We've only just got over the worst decade for improvements in living standards in 200 years. Now, once again, living standards for most workers are falling. And that's before what's anticipated in the coming weeks - a rise in interest rates, rising energy bills and higher taxes. Ben Harrison, director of the Work Foundation, said: \"Rising prices and the energy cap increase in April will affect all households across the UK, but it will acutely impact those in low paying and insecure employment.\" He called on the chancellor to use the Spring Statement on 23 March to support those most at risk by, for example, increasing Universal Credit payments. The British Chamber of Commerce suggested that Rishi Sunak should use the Spring Statement to delay a planned rise in National Insurance contributions by one year, to give firms a bit of financial headroom in the face of rising costs. Responding to the new figures, Chancellor Rishi Sunak said: \"I am confident that our labour market is in a good position to deal with the current global challenges. \"We know people are concerned about the rising cost of living so alongside continuing to help people find great jobs - we're providing direct support worth more than £20bn this financial year and next.\" Other experts also suggested that action was needed to help older people in particular. Separate research published by the ONS shows that a significant number of older workers have dropped out of the workforce for a mix of reasons, such as long-term sickness or those taking early retirement. However, some analysts said the strength in the labour market overall meant the Bank of England was likely to increase interest rates on Thursday. Martin Beck of the EY Item Club said the Bank might be worried that a tight jobs market could see workers asking for higher wages to off-set budget pressures. Earlier this year, the Bank's governor came under fire for suggesting that workers should not ask for big pay rises, to try to stop prices rising out of control. ",

            "content": "Retail chain Wilko has apologised for \"some miscommunication\" in which it told staff they could continue to work if they tested positive for Covid. In a memo, reported by The Mirror, the company said staff with the virus could continue to work in stores if they felt well enough to. Wilko confirmed the memo was sent out and the firm has since made a U-turn. \"When we get something wrong, we hold our hands up, admit it, and work to correct the situation,\" the firm said. Jerome Saint-Marc, Wilko chief executive, said he wanted to \"reassure all our customers and team members\" that the company's advice to staff with Covid symptoms or those who test positive was to stay at home and avoid contact with others. \"As throughout our 92 years on the High Street, the safety and wellbeing of our shoppers and teams is at the heart of our business and we're truly sorry for any understandable concerns our communications may have raised,\" he added. People with Covid in England are no longer legally required to self-isolate with all restrictions now removed, but it is still recommended. In Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland, people are still asked to self-isolate after a positive test. What are the new self-isolation rules?\nCovid: 'I will still ask my staff to isolate' In Wilko's initial memo to staff, the company, which has 414 stores in the UK, said: \"If you test positive for Covid-19 and feel well you can continue to come to work, if you feel too unwell you can follow the absence policy.\" The removal of all legal Covid rules has made the decision over whether to self-isolate or not an individual one. It has led to concern that lower-paid staff face the toughest choice when deciding to isolate or not, with up to two million workers not qualifying for sick pay due to the amount they earn. The Trades Union Congress has said people should not be forced into making a \"terrible choice\" over going into work with Covid or risking losing income by self-isolating at home.

            "content": "The company that has run the National Lottery since it was launched, Camelot, has lost out on the next licence. The Gambling Commission has announced Allwyn Entertainment Ltd as its preferred applicant for the lottery's next licence, which starts in 2024. It said it had received the highest number of applications to run the National lottery since the first licence was awarded in 1994. Camelot has been named as the \"reserve applicant\" after four firms applied. The National Lottery is one of the world's largest lotteries and has raised more than £45bn for 660,000 causes across the UK. It has also played a part in funding training and facilities over the past three decades for Great Britain's Olympic and Paralympic athletes. Coming for Camelot: The battle to land the lottery Allwyn is a UK-based subsidiary of Europe's largest lottery operator Sazka, which is owned by Czech oil and gas tycoon Karel Komarek. It signalled its intent to run the National Lottery by launching in early 2021. Its board includes former members of the London 2012 Olympics organising committee, Lord Coe and entrepreneur Sir Keith Mills, who sit on its advisory board. In a statement, Allwyn said its proposal was \"judged to be the best way of growing returns to good causes by revitalising the National Lottery in a safe and sustainable way\". \"The appointment of Allwyn will breathe fresh life into the National Lottery,\" it added. Camelot chief executive Nigel Railton said: \"I'm incredibly disappointed by today's announcement, but we still have a critical job to do - as our current licence runs until February 2024. \"We're now carefully reviewing the Gambling Commission's evaluation before deciding on our next steps.\" The Gambling Commission said it was \"satisfied\" that no application had been impacted by sanctions imposed by Western nations in relation to Russia's invasion of Ukraine. \"Our priority was to run a competition that would attract a strong field of candidates. Having received the most applications since 1994, it is clear that we've achieved just that,\" said Andrew Rhodes, the Gambling Commission's chief executive. \"I am confident that the success of the competition will lead to a highly successful fourth licence - one that maximises returns to good causes, promotes innovation, delivers against our statutory duties, and which ultimately protects the unique status of the National Lottery.\" ",

            "content": "The transport secretary has confirmed that all remaining Covid travel measures will be scrapped. Currently, everyone travelling to the UK must complete a passenger locator form before they arrive. Travellers who are not fully vaccinated have to take a Covid test before departure, fill in the form, and book and pay for a PCR test after arriving. Grant Shapps confirmed in a tweet that these rules will end at 04:00 on Friday. His announcement means that passengers who are not fully vaccinated will no longer have to take Covid tests before and after travelling to the UK. The passenger locator form will no longer be necessary either. People planning an overseas trip will still need to be aware of other countries' entry rules. Mr Shapps tweeted: \"These changes are possible due to our vaccine rollout and mean greater freedom in time for Easter.\" When any new Covid strains appear in the future, the government said its default approach would be to use \"the least-stringent measures\" for restricting travel. Its \"Living with Covid\" plan said new measures at the border would only be considered in \"extreme circumstances\". It said the UKHSA would closely monitor the prevalence and spread of Covid variants. What are the UK's 'Living with Covid' plans? Scotland and Wales have agreed to follow England in scrapping the remaining coronavirus border measures. But Welsh Health Minister Eluned Morgan said she was doing so \"reluctantly\" - and was \"extremely disappointed\" that testing requirements and the passenger location form were being ditched. The Scottish government said consistency across the four nations was agreed because of the \"negative impact of non-alignment on the tourism industry\". Testing requirements for fully-vaccinated arrivals into the UK were dropped in February. The latest move was welcomed by some figures in the travel industry, which has campaigned for the remaining rules to be dropped so businesses can take full advantage of strong summer holiday demand. Tim Alderslade, chief executive of trade body Airlines UK, said: \"Today's announcement sends a clear message to the world - the UK travel sector is back. \"With travellers returning to the UK no longer burdened by unnecessary forms and testing requirements, we can now look forward to the return to pre-Covid normality throughout the travel experience.\" A Virgin Atlantic spokesperson said: \"The removal of all remaining UK travel restrictions is the final important step towards frictionless air travel, helping to further restore consumer confidence as we welcome more customers back to the skies this spring and summer. \"To uphold the experience of all travellers, it's vital that the UK Government works closely with industry to ensure the UK border is ready for increasing passengers, as international travel ramps up.\" Meanwhile, Eurostar's chief executive Jacques Damas said the easing of restrictions would help the cross-Channel train operator's recovery. \"We hope and expect to see the UK's approach replicated across our other markets in the coming weeks,\" Mr Damas said. However, as Covid restrictions recede, other headwinds for the aviation industry are appearing. The price of jet fuel has soared as a result of higher crude oil prices. This adds to cost pressures on airlines, although some have been protected by their hedging strategies, whereby they purchased fuel in advance at lower prices. On Friday, the chief executive of Heathrow airport, John Holland-Kaye, said the recovery of aviation remained \"overshadowed by war and Covid uncertainty\". Businesses will also be keeping a careful eye on whether consumers' confidence to book is knocked by the war in Ukraine and rising household bills squeezing disposable incomes. Air France-KLM and Ryanair have both recently warned air fares will rise. ",

            "content": "Petrol prices are likely to fall back from record levels due to the costs of wholesale fuel and global oil easing, UK motoring groups have said. The average price for a litre of petrol hit £1.63 on Sunday after rising above £1.60 for the first time last week. Diesel remained above £1.73 a litre, but the AA said \"wild\" pump prices should stabilise, unless global oil prices take off again. But MPs were told this was a \"lull before the storm\" of more price hikes. Nathan Piper, head of oil and gas research at financial services company Investec, said consumers \"need to get ready for what could be continued increases in fuel prices.\" Russia's invasion of Ukraine sparked oil costs to surge worldwide. Mr Piper told the Treasury Committee: \"If more stringent actions are imposed upon Russia, and five million barrels a day is truly taken out of the market, then oil prices would really have no ceiling.\" He explained that the UK was roughly self-sufficient in petrol but imported much of its diesel. Two thirds of UK consumers use diesel so that it could see the biggest price increases at the pump, he said. Dr Amrita Sen, director of research at Energy Aspects, told the committee that petrol prices could rise to around £2.40 a litre. And that diesel prices of \"£2.50 - even closer to £3\" were \"definitely in the realms of possibility\". She said the UK could follow Germany in introducing rationing measures which have already seen BP and Shell reduce diesel wholesales to industry. \"If we need to rebuild stocks over the summer so that we have a buffer over the winter...it is industry that will need to be curtailed and that's where the first set of rationing will have to come in,\" she said. Mr Piper said the only other option was for the government to release some of its stockpiles of petrol and crude oil. \"But it'll be industry that takes the brunt of any rationing initially,\" he said. Meanwhile, the AA said filling up a typical 55-litre car tank now costs £89.90p on average, up from £68.57 a year ago. Oil prices soared after Russia invaded Ukraine, with the price of Brent crude oil - the global benchmark for prices - hitting a near 14-year high at one point. However, in the past few days, the price of oil has dropped as fears that the European Union would follow the US and Canada in banning Russian oil have eased. Brent crude fell as much as 8% to trade at $103.68 per barrel on Monday. Petrol price hits new record above £1.60 a litre\nHow has Ukraine conflict affected petrol prices? The RAC said drivers would have to stomach probably more rises this week, but added they \"should soon get some respite from pump prices jumping by several pence a litre every day as oil and wholesale prices appear to have settled\". \"The price hikes seen over the weekend are still a result of the oil price rise which began at the start of the month and peaked early last week at $137 a barrel,\" said RAC fuel spokesman Simon Williams. \"As the oil price has now fallen back, we should hopefully reach the peak and start to see prices going the other way to reflect the big drop in wholesale costs seen at the end of last week, subject to no further spikes in the barrel price this week.\" The reason higher prices at the pumps are likely to remain despite falling commodity prices is due to the way retailers buy the fuel and the time lag between purchasing at a certain price and then selling it on. Yet, there is a concern some retailers might be reluctant to lower their prices for fear of being caught out if wholesale costs jump back up again. Luke Bosdet, the AA's fuel price spokesman, said a 10.6p-a-litre slump in wholesale petrol costs on Wednesday and Thursday last week, followed by oil's fall in value, had produced \"bizarre price anomalies\". \"In one town this weekend, filling a tank at one forecourt was more than a pound cheaper than directly across the road at another,\" he said. Mr Bosdet said weekends were the busiest time for forecourts and the rush by drivers to beat further potential price increases had pushed up demand, which had actually led to even higher prices at the pumps as stations had to resupply at a faster rate. Oil prices are mainly determined by the price of crude oil and the dollar exchange rate, as agreements are made in dollars. Russia is the third largest oil exporter and some Western countries, for example the US and Canada, decided to halt imports from the country in response to Russia's actions. It means demand for oil from other producers has increased, leading to increased prices. The UK only imports about 6% of oil from Russia, so is not as dependent on Russia for the commodity supply as other European countries are and has said it plans to phase it out. It is, however, affected by the global shifts in price. But the price of Brent crude dropped in recent days, due to reduced fears of a European ban on Russian oil, and also partly due to speculation that extra supplies could come onto the market from Iran, Venezuela and the UAE. The conflict in Ukraine has led to concerns being raised by Western nations about where they get their energy from. Energy Minister Greg Hands said the UK's transition to cleaner forms of energy production was \"an issue of national security\" and not just of decarbonisation. Speaking at an event in London, he said: \"By switching to cheaper power generated in the UK, for the UK, we will ensure that we're not dependent on any unfriendly foreign country to keep our homes warm and lit.\" However, Mr Hands acknowledged that the transition to cleaner energy sources would take time, and there was still a need to invest in domestic fossil fuel production.

            "content": "High demand for workout gear and health-conscious vegetarian options are now being used to calculate the change in the cost of living in the UK. Items such as tinned beans, boosted by a rise in plant-based diets, have also been added to the basket of goods used to measure prices. The review by the Office for National Statistics also saw pet collars added. But men's suits and doughnuts are out as homeworking shifted how we dress and snack during Covid lockdowns. The ONS said it decided to add meat-free sausages to the basket of more than 700 goods, which is used to calculate how the cost of living is changing, to reflect a boost in demand for healthier food options. It also said that the removal of a men's two-piece suit, and the addition of sports bras and crop tops, accounted for the fact that spending on formal clothes has been falling, as well as a \"heightened awareness of fitness\". \"With many people still working from home, demand for more formal clothing has continued to decrease,\" ONS head of economic statistics Sam Beckett said. Since the start of the pandemic, retailers such as Boohoo and Asos have reported a boost in sales for loungewear items such as joggers or hoodies too. In total, 19 items were added while 15 have been removed. And although the deletion of doughnuts from the basket might suggest customers are opting for healthier snacks while working-from-home, multipacks of cakes are still included in the calculation. Food boss says prices could rise by up to 15%\nWhy are prices rising so quickly?\nLockdown fashion: 'People are back in pyjamas' Other additions to the basket of goods signalled a shift in how consumers are spending during the pandemic. Anti-bacterial wipes, as well as craft and hobby kits for adults, were included in the basket of goods for the first time. Pet collars for dogs and cats were also added \"to reflect the growth in pet accessories linked to the increase in pet ownership more generally during the pandemic\", it said. Items such as atlas books or encyclopaedias, as well as coal, are out too. The official statistics body pointed out that the sale of domestic coal will be banned in 2023 as part of the government's attempt to tackle climate change. Dropping the item this year protects the index from being affected by big swings in price as that headline approaches. The publication comes as experts point out that what has been described as the cost of living crisis could be exacerbated by the conflict in Ukraine. On Monday, research from the Resolution Foundation think tank suggested that the war could see another spike in the cost of living this autumn. It said that inflation, which tracks how the cost of living changes over time, could reach 10% for the poorest households, whose energy and food bills make up a bigger proportion of their budgets. Some analysts suggested on Monday that the update to the basket of goods was \"out of touch with the everyday expenditure for the masses\". Myron Jobson, senior personal finance analyst at Interactive Investor, said that climbing sessions, which was added this year, \"is unlikely to rank highly on the list of spending priorities among those struggling to make ends meet during the cost-of-living crisis\". \"We all have our own inflation number, and it is worth keeping tabs on your spending habits to get a better idea of the goods and services that are eating most into your budget, and where you could cut back,\" he added. With inflation at the highest rate seen in 30 years, the ONS's methodology has come under extra scrutiny because of the concern that product selections do not reflect purchases made by those on lower incomes. Poverty campaigner Jack Monroe had complained that the official way inflation is calculated fail to accurately reflect this. The ONS has said some changes were already in the pipeline to address that.From 2024, it will use a far wider range of prices from supermarket tills, which should make it easier to work out if certain brands of pasta or beans, for example, are rising faster than others.

            "header": "M&S and Asos among firms trying to hire Ukraine refugees",
            "content": "Major UK businesses are lining up to offer jobs to Ukrainian refugees when they start to arrive in the UK. A group of more than 45 large businesses is pressing the government to make it easier for those driven out by Russia's invasion to come to the UK. Marks & Spencer, Asos, Lush and recruitment giant Robert Walters are some of the firms involved. The government has been criticised over the speed and scale of its response to the Ukraine refugee crisis. The initiative is being led by British entrepreneur Emma Sinclair, the chief executive of Enterprise Alumni. She said it had quickly gained ground in a short space of time. The project is in its early stages, and many of the details about how it will work in practice are unclear. Ms Sinclair, who is co-ordinating the initiative at the moment despite a recent head injury, told the BBC that many of her ancestors were from Eastern Europe, including Ukraine. The aim of the project is to help \"tens of thousands\" of refugees not only get jobs in the UK, but to help them find accommodation, and gain language skills. Many UK businesses have been facing labour shortages due to a combination of factors including Covid and Brexit, and it is in their interests to fill outstanding vacancies. However, Ms Sinclair said the consortium was \"purely altruistic\" and not acting to promote any particular corporate agenda. The companies involved, especially the recruitment firms, have got \"thousands of jobs to fill every day of the week\" - this is not a new situation for them, she said. \"People are inherently generally good, and people want to help,\" she added. The initiative, which was first reported in the Sunday Times, wants to provide tens of thousands of jobs. Ms Sinclair is due to have a meeting with the newly appointed Minister for Refugees Richard Harrington on Monday, and she has also been in contact with Number 10 Downing Street. \"We [businesses] want people, we need people, and we want to help,\" she said. \"We want to see movement on rising numbers of refugees.\" She said the current focus of this initiative is to help refugees from Ukraine rebuild their lives, but in an ideal world the scheme would be extended to all refugees. The government has been criticised, including by its own MPs, for not moving quickly enough to help refugees from Ukraine. Ms Sinclair said that the UK \"can do better\" and \"go faster\" than it is currently on Ukraine refugees. \"We want to see the red tape burnt,\" she said. A government spokesperson said: \"We are standing shoulder to shoulder with Ukrainians which is why we've made it easier for those with valid Ukrainian passports to come here. This is alongside changes to visas to ensure Ukrainians in the UK can stay here. \"We have expanded our visa application capacity to 13,000 a week, deployed additional staff across the EU, with a 24/7 helpline in place to ensure those who need appointments can get them to come here. \"This allows us to balance security risks while welcoming those in need,\" they added. Marks & Spencer, which is part of the consortium, said it was \"absolutely committed to supporting Ukrainian refugees\" both through humanitarian schemes and through jobs. \"We are in discussion with the Home Office about the detail of this,\" it said. Online fashion retailer Asos, which is also involved in the initiative, said: \"We are currently recruiting for many tech engineering roles in the UK and we know Ukraine has a strong skill set in this area. \"We are also working with our partners to explore opportunities at our distribution centres in the UK and elsewhere in Europe.\" Asos expects the number of positions to be in double digits in the UK, adding the business already has a Ukrainian workforce in Poland so opportunities for newly arrived refugees will exist there. High street cosmetics business Lush said it was \"happy to consider refugees for any role, even those we would usually advertise for internal candidates only\". It said its recruiters are meeting with the Refugee Council charity next week to \"share what potential opportunities there are across the business\". Lush added that it was recruiting web developers and other tech roles, designers, spa therapists and warehouse and retail assistants - and from May and June, temporary staff for the Christmas period. Toby Fowlston, chief executive of recruitment giant Robert Walters, said the firm had \"committed to hiring displaced Ukrainians into our own business and as a recruitment company we will also represent them as potential employees to our clients\". \"We will need government support to help expedite working visas to ensure we can act quickly.\",\" he added. Another large UK recruitment firm Impellam Group is part of the consortium, as is software company Unit4 and Portman Dental Group.

However, she warned that for a six-month placement, both the refugees and the people offering space in their houses need to be screened, otherwise it \"might be a little dangerous\". Ms Nathan added that the processes for dealing with Ukrainian refugees also needed to be fair to refugees of other nationalities. \"What happens to Afghans?\" she said. \"They are still in hotels.\" Organisations that are not linked to the initiative have also contacted the Home Office to say they are willing to offer refugees jobs, include Tesco, Sainsbury's, Morrisons and the Co-op. More than 2.5 million people have fled Ukraine since Russia's invasion, and European Union countries have let them come in without a visa for three years. In the UK, at the moment only Ukrainian refugees with family connections in the UK can apply for a visa under the Ukraine Family Scheme. Other visas are available but application centres in Ukraine are closed. However, under a new scheme called Homes for Ukraine, people will be able to nominate a named individual or a family to stay with them rent-free, or in another property, for at least six months. Sponsors will not be required to know the refugees in advance and there will be no limit on the number of people who can come to the UK through this route. Refugees will be given three years leave to remain, with the right to work and access public services. ",

            "header": "Fears funeral plan reforms could mean thousands lose money",
            "content": "\"It has given me sleepless nights, I've been up at 3 o'clock in the morning wondering what the outcome will be.\" 72-year-old Lyn Burrow is talking about the thousands of pounds she's paid to cover the cost of her funeral when she dies. She and her husband Fred, 80, spent a total of £6,310 with funeral plan provider Safe Hands. Now they're worried they might lose some, or even all, of their money. The funeral plan market is being reformed and industry insiders are worried that this could mean some providers will go out of business, leaving tens of thousands of customers out of pocket. \"The way things sounded we stood the chance of losing all the money we had paid for these plans, so we decided we would cancel the plans and would just have to swallow the £800 cancellation fees,\" says Lyn. \"We felt if we at least got some money back it would be better than nothing\". Safe Hands, which has withdrawn its application for approval by the UK's financial regulator, meaning it will not be allowed to operate after 29 July, told Lyn it hoped to find another funeral provider to take over its client book. It also said Lyn would have to wait a month for her refund, leaving her worried she may not see any money at all. Safe Hands did not reply to the BBC's numerous requests for comment. People like Lyn and Fred are worried because the UK's funeral plan sector is being reformed by the UK's financial watchdog, the Financial Conduct Authority (FCA). From 29 July, any provider must be authorised and regulated by the FCA which, from that point onwards, will give consumers far greater protection than they have at the moment. The FCA says reform is needed because elderly, and very often vulnerable, customers have been subjected to unfair practices like high pressure sales tactics and cold calls, and it wants to raise standards by regulating what companies can and cannot do. The very real problem for people like Lyn and Fred though is that whilst the regulation of funeral plan companies will be a good thing in future, getting to that point could mean some people lose out. \"There are around 65 firms that operate in this sector and not all of them will be able to demonstrate they can meet the standards that will ensure protection for consumers in the future\" according to industry expert Kate Robinson from Avyse Partners, which specialises in regulatory consultancy. \"The point is - firms which don't go for authorisation will either choose not to be regulated or won't be able to meet the new standards because they present such a significant step change to what was in place previously. \"This means some providers may not be able to deliver the funerals they have sold because they have to either transfer the business to another firm or it may force firms into administration and if that happens customers will likely lose out.\" 1.6 million customers\n200,000 funeral plans taken out every year\nApproximately 65 companies\nAverage plan costs £4,000\nAverage plan lasts for 8 years Source: FCA/Fairer Finance Whilst many of the larger, more reputable firms are expected to be granted authorisation by the FCA, others are unlikely to even apply for authorisation or will be turned down. If that happens they will be unable or not allowed to operate beyond 29 July. The Funeral Planning Authority told Money Box it has been concerned about this situation for a number of years. \"We made our concerns known to both HM Treasury and the FCA,\" it said. \"Customers who took out plans in good faith are potentially being punished as a consequence of a Government policy, the approach taken to the implementation of that policy, and the lack of a properly thought through transition process that was designed to protect customers.\" The government said: \"Bringing pre-paid funeral plans into regulation will protect consumers from bad practice within the sector including by exposing any unsustainable business models and preventing problems from getting worse, and impacting more consumers. \"This follows extensive consultation and the Financial Conduct Authority is now taking proportionate steps to regulate these pre-paid plans. \"The FCA's guidance is clear that firms not seeking authorisation should transfer their existing books of business or wind down in an orderly way before regulation starts.\" James Daley, the managing director and co-founder of consumer group Fairer Finance, has this advice for people worried about their funeral plans: \"If you're in the cooling off period [having very recently bought a plan] and you can cancel free of charge and you're with a smaller company you're worried about, then cancel because there's no cost. \"But if you're going to incur a cancellation fee, and some of these policies charge up to £1,300 in cancellation fees, my advice would be to sit tight for now. \"Rather than crystalising a loss it may be better to hold your nerve for a few weeks or a few months and see what this settlement ends up being.\" You can hear more on this story on BBC Radio 4's Money Box podcast by clicking here.

            "header": "'Reselling PlayStations keeps a roof over my head'",
            "content": "A sudden drop in income, a mounting medical debt and a family to feed left Sheraz (not his real name) struggling to find another way of making money. During the pandemic his wife lost her job as a beautician, and the government's pandemic support was not easily available to him. So, he turned to \"scalping\" - an unfavourable term for stockpiling popular products and reselling them at a higher price for profit. Many sought-after items are resold, including concert tickets, limited-edition trainers and games consoles. While the general resale of football tickets is illegal, practically everything else is legal to buy up and resell. Sheraz says he only sells to his friends and family to make about £250 extra a month, so that he can \"slowly eat away\" at a £50,000 medical bill. But for a majority of resellers, scalping is big business - and they are using tech to give them an added advantage. A lot of electronics are in short supply because of a global shortage of semiconductor chips, which are essentially the brains of modern electronic products. Cars, graphics cards, smartphones and games consoles have all been affected. The PlayStation 5 - Sony's next-generation games console - has been particularly hard for many gamers to get hold of. Some shoppers relied on leaked information from big retailers to predict when new stock might become available. But even those staying up until 03:00 excitedly refreshing a retailer's website would find the stock sold out in minutes. Real shoppers were being beaten by bots. Software developed by the scalpers can notify them as soon as stock is available from any of their target websites. Sometimes the bots can even automatically buy items. The PS5 consoles were being snapped up by bots, only to be resold for twice the regular retail price of £450. Jack Bayliss is a 24-year-old former investment banker who started reselling six years ago. His profit margins were huge - sometimes he would buy Yeezy trainers for £150 and sell them for up to £1,000. He decided to quit his day job and start Aftermarket Arbitrage - a reselling company that teaches others how to scalp. Through subscriptions alone, Mr Bayliss says he has made £456,000 in revenue since starting the company 18 months ago. For £30 a month, subscribers receive alerts as soon as the bots detect that a rare item is in stock. The 1,200 subscribers are notified on the Discord app, and can quickly head to the retailer's website to snap up the item. Asked whether scalping was fair, Mr Bayliss told the BBC: \"If you look at any marketplace, if there is an arbitrage opportunity, people are going to capitalise on it. \"Why would you leave the money on the table?\" Rather than being greedy, Mr Bayliss said scalpers were simply trying to make some extra cash. But for some, he said it was also to make a living. One scalper told the BBC how he cleared a £30,000 gambling debt with the money he earned through scalping. Another said reselling had introduced some structure into his life and helped him cope with alcohol addiction. Both men declined to be interviewed on camera over concerns for their safety. Mr Bayliss received many death threats after articles about Aftermarket Arbitrage were published. Despite this, Sheraz agreed to be filmed. \"The last two years hasn't been easy for most people,\" he told the BBC. \"I was pretty much rock bottom. If it wasn't for reselling, I wouldn't have a roof over my head.\" \"I've got young kids. And when you've got to put food on the table, you've got to do what you've got to do. As long as it's not criminal, which this isn't.\" Using bots to buy products is not illegal in the UK, but has drawn the attention of lawmakers. Douglas Chapman, Scottish National Party MP for Dunfermline and West Fife, is leading the charge against reselling. Last year, he introduced a bill to Parliament to ban the resale of electronic goods bought by automated bots. He says that consumers would benefit from the eventual banning of scalping altogether. \"I think it's skewing the market beyond what's reasonable, and I think we need to look at what are the protections for the consumers,\" he said. He said \"entrepreneurs\" should live \"within the same rules as someone setting up a High Street shop\". And although it may hurt his own income, Sheraz agrees. \"I do think bots should be stopped. There are some people that will do this 24/7 and will have up to 20 computers set up. They are stockpiling PlayStations and trainers and toys,\" he said. \"It's almost market manipulating.\" Mr Chapman's bill failed to make it through Parliament late last year, but he is planning to renew his bid very soon. But Mr Bayliss sees it as a matter of supply and demand. \"I wouldn't class not having a PS5 as suffering. There are people out there that want to do more than their nine-to-five. They want a side hustle,\" he said. \"If you see friction between supply and demand, you're going to see someone taking advantage of it.\" ",

            "header": "Which companies are pulling out of Russia?",
            "content": "Thirty years ago when communism collapsed in the Soviet Union, Western firms stepped up their presence in Russia. The arrival of big Western companies symbolised the start of a new era with Russians becoming eager consumers of brands ranging from fast-food chain McDonalds to Levi jeans and luxury goods. Now, in the wake of President Putin's invasion of Ukraine, a growing number of firms have suspended activities in Russia. So which firms, in which sectors, are exiting and why have others held back? McDonald's, Coca-Cola, Starbucks and Heineken are the latest companies to announce they are halting business in Russia after mounting pressure to act. McDonald's said it was temporarily closing its roughly 850 restaurants in Russia, while Starbucks also said its 100 coffee shops would shut. The firms initially remained tight lipped over the conflict, but took action because shareholders \"wouldn't stand\" for the continued generation of profits from Russia, says Anna MacDonald, a fund manager at Amati Global Investors. \"It was affecting their share prices and the feeling was that it was just utterly inappropriate to continue to do so,\" she told the BBC. Pepsi, which has a much larger presence in Russia than rival Coca-Cola, said it was halting the production and sale of Pepsi and other global brands in Russia, but the company, which employs 20,000 people there, said it would continue to offer other products. Food companies Nestle, Mondelez, Procter & Gamble and Unilever have halted investment in Russia, but said they would continue providing essentials. British American Tobacco has announced it plans to sell its business in Russia due to it being \"no longer sustainable in the current environment\". The world's biggest cosmetics firm L'Oreal and rival Estee Lauder are both closing shops and ceasing online sales. Estee Lauder, whose brands include Michael Kors, DKNY, Clinique and Bobbi Brown, has had a presence in the country for about 30 years and Russia was where it had some of its strongest sales. In fact, Russia was the fifth largest European retail market globally last year, valued at £337.2bn. So some brands may not want to burn their bridges, if there's a chance of returning at a later date. That is why many firms, including other luxury retailers like Burberry and Chanel, simply say they are \"suspending\" sales and temporarily shutting stores rather than withdrawing altogether, says Chris Weafer, chief executive of consulting firm Macro-advisory Limited. With sanctions limiting forms of payment and huge uncertainty over future prices and consumer appetite, the business climate is \"extremely challenging\" he adds, making the decision to hit pause easier. The world's biggest fashion retailers H&M and Zara-owner Inditex, which has 502 stores in the country, for example have already suspended sales in Russia, citing \"tragic developments\" in Ukraine. Other brands like Nike have simply said they can't currently guarantee delivery of goods to customers in Russia. More brands are likely to follow suit, according to Maureen Hinton of retail consultancy GlobalData. Boohoo, Swedish furniture giant Ikea and Japanese clothing retailer Uniqlo which initially kept its 49 Russian stores open, saying clothes were a \"necessity of life\", are some of the other names to have now cut ties. Even Levi's, the jeans brand that became a symbol of post-Soviet business in Russia, has closed its shops. The all-American jeans firm said about 4% of its total net sales came from Eastern Europe and Russia last year, but \"any business considerations are clearly secondary to the human suffering experienced by so many\". Samsung, the leading supplier of smartphones in Russia, has said it will suspend shipments to the country but has not said whether its shops will close. Japan's Sony and Nintendo suspended deliveries of gaming consoles, and Sony suspended the launch of racing game \"Gran Turismo 7\". Apple has also halted all of its product sales in Russia, and limited other services such as Apple Pay and Apple Maps. Its shops have closed too. For a firm like Apple selling imported items, that's a relatively straightforward decision to take, suggests Macro-advisory's Chris Weafer. \"Companies do not want to be associated with the Russian regime and what's happening in Ukraine,\" he says. Their Russian business may be profitable, but \"the rest of the world is more important\" when it comes to reputational risk. Some tech companies, flooded by misinformation, are also restricting Kremlin-linked media outlets posting on their platforms. Facebook was blocked in Russia after it said it had refused to stop fact-checking and labelling content from state-owned news organisations. Meanwhile, TikTok has blocked all non-Russian content in Russia and suspended live streaming, although it is allowing historical content uploaded by domestic accounts to stay online, including videos by state-backed media services. Large consultancy and law firms were some of the first to set up a presence in Russia after the collapse of the Soviet Union but they mostly operate out of the spotlight. All of the Big Four accounting groups - Deloitte, KPMG, EY and PricewaterhouseCoopers (PwC) - have said they will no longer have a member firm in Russia because of the invasion. Top-tier law firm Freshfields says it will no longer work with any clients linked to the Russian state either. Others say they are reviewing their client base and Russian links. What sanctions are being imposed on Russia?\nHow badly will Russia be hit by new sanctions? A senior executive for consultancy firm McKinsey, for example, wrote online that the company would \"no longer serve\" any government or state-owned entities in Russia. According to McKinsey's website, it serves 21 of the 30 biggest Russian companies. When the conflict in Ukraine broke out, energy firms came under immediate pressure. And that is set to intensify now the UK, US and UK have announced bans or curbs on Russian oil and gas. BP owns a large stake in Russian energy giant Rosneft, but within days of the war starting it had announced the operation would be hived off. That was closely followed by pledges from Shell, ExxonMobil and Equinor to cut their Russian investments following pressure from shareholders, as well as from governments and the public. Firms want to be seen to be doing the \"right thing\", says Russ Mould, investment director at AJ Bell. Meanwhile, Total Energies, another big player in Russia, has said it won't fund new projects in the country, but unlike its peers does not plan to sell existing investments. It is still far from clear what will happen to those investments - whether they can eventually be sold, recouping some of their value, or if they will simply be written off at great cost. Film fans in Russia wanting to go and see Warner Bros' new blockbuster The Batman won't be able to after the company suspended new film releases in the country. The US movie-maker was joined by Disney and Sony, with premieres of animation Turning Red and Marvel adaptation Morbius also being withdrawn. Disney has also paused its TV channels. Netflix, a fairly new entrant in Russia, has suspended its service in the country and put all \"future projects\" on pause. All companies said their decisions were based on the \"humanitarian crisis\" in Ukraine, rather than as a result of sanctions that have been imposed. All three of the world's major record labels - Sony, Warner and Universal - have closed their offices in Russia, and Spotify has announced it is cancelling its subscription service, although the free, ad-funded version will still work. Payment giants Visa, Mastercard, American Express and PayPal are pulling out of the Russian market in protest. Russian banks have, however, already downplayed the impact of the announcements on their clients. Sberbank, for example, said that Visa and Mastercard-branded cards would continue to work on Russian territory because all payments in Russia are made through a national system. However, domestically issued cards won't work abroad, and foreign-issued ones won't work inside the country. US investment bank Goldman Sachs was the first Wall Street bank to say it was winding down its Russian business. The bank, soon followed by JPMorgan, said it was doing so in compliance with regulatory and licensing requirements. German lender Deutsche Bank, which had faced criticism for defending plans not to withdraw, has also said it was taking steps to exit, pledging \"there won't be any new business in Russia\". Jaguar Land Rover, General Motors, Aston Martin and Rolls-Royce are among the car-makers that have halted deliveries of vehicles to Russia due to the conflict, while construction equipment manufacturer JCB has paused all operations. Cars are the biggest UK export to Russia, but still only 1% of UK cars went to Russia last year. So any decision to stop exporting won't be particularly costly, and will have been made easier by nagging concerns over whether or not payments will arrive, says investment analyst Russ Mould. Transporting cars to Russia could prove difficult anyway, with the world's two largest cargo shipping companies, MSC and Maersk, suspending routes to and from Russia, except for food, medical and humanitarian supply deliveries. While the flood of announcements from companies stepping back goes on, there are calls for more to join them. Attention has turned to big food firms like Burger King who have condemned Russia's actions and have pledged support for Ukraine, but are yet to pull out. Some firms will also find it much harder to extricate themselves, even if pressure mounts in the coming days and weeks. In retaliation against sanctions introduced by Western countries, Moscow has banned the sale of Russian assets. So firms that, in recent years, have been encouraged to establish a presence in Russia are \"locked in\" with local businesses, staff and supply chains. Marks & Spencer, for example, has 48 shops in Russia but they are operated by a Turkish franchise company called FiBA. M&S has said it is suspending shipments of its goods to FiBA's Russian business, but the shops in the country remain open. Restaurant Brands International, which owns Burger King, told the BBC its Russian outlets were operated by franchisees with which it had \"long-standing legal agreements\" that were not easy to change. Yum Brands, which owns KFC and Pizza Hut, said it was suspending operations in the Russian KFC restaurants it owns, and finalising an agreement with its main franchisee to temporarily halt Pizza Hut operations. Mr Weafer predicts it is likely that some large consumer brands may express concerns over the military conflict, but try to \"ride it out\".

            "content": "US President Joe Biden has announced a ban on imports of Russian diamonds, seafood and vodka in the latest response to Russia's war in Ukraine. The US, European Union and other allies also plan to revoke Russia’s status as an equal trade partner, paving the way for further economic punishment. The moves add to sanctions that have isolated Russia economically since the invasion. Its currency has collapsed, while global firms rush to exit the country. Russian President Vladimir Putin has likened Western sanctions on banks and oligarchs to a declaration of war. Moscow has also threatened to nationalise production plants or factories where work has been suspended. Western allies announced further economic retaliation on Friday. The European Union said it would ban imports of key Russian iron and steel products and bar new energy investments in the country, while the UK put sanctions on hundreds of Russian politicians. The US, EU and UK also said they would cut off shipments of luxury goods to Russia. Mr Biden said the latest steps will be \"another crushing blow to the Russian economy\". What sanctions are being imposed on Russia?\nHow Asia is divided over Russia sanctions Under international rules, designating a country a \"most favoured nation\" provides reciprocal trade privileges such as lower tariffs, taxes imposed at the border. Stripping Russia of that status clears the way for higher tariffs on key products it sells such as mineral fuels, fertilisers and metals. Mr Biden said he was coordinating the plans with the European Union and other advanced economies, including Canada and Japan, each of which will take similar steps. In the US, Congress, which must act for the move to go into effect, has already declared itself in favour of the move. Most Favoured Nation (MFN) is a status conferred by membership of the World Trade Organisation. It might sound as though it confers special advantages, but that's not really the case. In fact, it is a baseline designed to ensure all World Trade Organisation members are treated equally, unless they are members of a specific free trade area or agreement. Under normal circumstances, it limits countries' ability to impose trade barriers against one another - or offer individual countries special concessions. By removing this status from Russia, G7 countries will be able to target its exports with punitive tariffs, or taxes. In fact one of them, Canada, has already done so. Last week it imposed tariffs of 35% on all products coming from Russia and its compliant ally, Belarus. In order to do this, Canada relied on an exemption contained in one of the WTO agreements, which allows members to take action they consider necessary to protect their \"essential security interests\". It is likely the others will do the same. In addition, Western allies said they planned to cut Russia off from accessing finance from international organisations such as the World Bank and International Monetary Fund. \"Russia cannot grossly violate international law and expect to benefit from being part of the international economic order,\" the G7, a group of seven advanced economies including the UK, said in a statement. The US ban on key Russian imports will deny Mr Putin more than $1bn in revenue, the White House said, while the ban on US exports of luxury goods hits trade worth about $550m per year. That is just a fraction of the roughly $28bn worth of trade the US and Russia exchanged in 2019. Mr Biden promised further measures, including tightening sanctions on oligarchs and their families. \"We're going to continue to squeeze Putin,\" Mr Biden said. \"He is the aggressor and... must pay the price.\" Economists say the sanctions previously announced will throw Russia into a severe economic recession this year. But it is not clear that the economic disarray has altered Mr Putin's military ambitions. At a press conference on Thursday, White House spokeswoman Jen Psaki was asked when the weight of the sanctions might lead to a change in Mr Putin's actions. \"Our objective of course is to bring an end to this conflict, she said. \"In terms of when that will happen, I'm unfortunately not in the mind of President Putin.... When it will change his calculus, I can't give a prediction of that.\" LIVE: Latest updates from on the ground\nWATCH: On the front line with Ukrainian soldiers\nIMAGES: Scale of destruction in Mariupol revealed\nWAR CRIMES: Could Putin be prosecuted?\nIN DEPTH: Full coverage of the conflict ",

            "header": "Calls for new price cap on heating oil as cost of living rises",
            "content": "Often living in rural or isolated locations, it is thought about 1.5m households use oil to heat their homes. Like other forms of energy, the cost of oil has spiralled in recent months. But those who use oil are not protected by the energy price cap. How are they coping? Eira Featley lives in a three-bedroom council house in Stoke Ash, near Eye, in Suffolk. The single-mother's kerosene-fuelled boiler runs her central heating and hot water system. Mrs Featley is also the full-time carer of her son, Steven, 27, who has a terminal liver disease and receives universal credit. \"We have to keep the home fairly warm for Steven because your liver controls your temperature,\" she said. Like other heating oil users in England, Mrs Featley has to buy her kerosene in minimum batches of 500 litres (110 gallons). Each batch, she said, will last three or four months. Up until October, 500 litres of heating oil cost about £200. Unlike gas and electricity, households do not to have a contract with any one company and instead buy from whichever supplier can do them the best deal. In January Mrs Featley sought to top up her tank and was quoted £326 for 500 litres. She said she would have struggled to pay this amount and sought help from her local Citizens Advice branch, which found a fund to pay for her heating oil. \"It was like winning the lottery,\" Mrs Featley said. \"I felt like a weight had been lifted off my shoulders.\" She is hoping the quantity will get her through until May when the weather should be warmer. \"It's going to be really tough,\" she said. \"I'm going to worry about it, and that's causing more stress on what's already a stressed family. \"I might even have to borrow if it stays at the rate that it's at at the moment, because you can't keep asking for money from the Citizens Advice. \"There are other people out there who need it, but if it's £670 in May what am I going to do?\" Farmers facing price rises fear volatile times\nOil price rises due to fears over Russian shortfall\nCost of filling diesel family car hits record £90 Mrs Featley is not alone in her concerns. In some areas residents team up to try and get a discount by purchasing oil in bulk. But the Oil Club in south Norfolk said rates had gone up \"exponentially\" from an average of 55p per litre on 1 January before reaching 97p on 6 March. Haydon Wilding, who runs the Hoops oil-buying syndicate on Suffolk's Shotley Peninsula, said customers had very little choice but to accept the price rises. \"We're all suffering, prices are going and up and up,\" he said. \"Now there's the problem that people are panic-buying, wanting to top up their tanks, because they can see the lead times (for delivery) are getting longer.\" \"The problem is that it is not a capped industry and is not regulated in any way,\" he said. According to the website BoilerJuice, kerosene was selling for almost £1.34 per litre on 8 March, which makes the cost of 500 litres £703 including VAT - more than double the October price of about £340. Tim Buckman, marketing officer at BoilerJuice, said both households and suppliers were struggling with unpredictable oil prices. \"There's usually a lag of a few days to a week or so from when a customer places an order to delivery,\" he said. \"But the prices are going up so quick - for suppliers [that] they risk delivering oil that costs more on the day than the price they sold it for 10 days earlier. \"Right now you're lucky if you can find a committed price and a committed delivery date.\" On Thursday morning, the website could not supply a quote for heating oil for a postcode in Norfolk, citing a lack of suppliers due to extremely high demand. Mid-Suffolk Citizens Advice, which serves the Stowmarket and Eye, said it fears more and more people will struggle with rising oil costs. Clare Peake, an energy specialist, has seen a doubling in cases of people worried about energy bills. \"It started in November time when 500 litres of oil was about £280,\" she said. \"And within this week I've seen people saying they have been quoted anything from £500, £600 to £1000. \"We're very rural in this part of Suffolk. You don't have to go very far outside the town of Stowmarket to be having oil.\" She said a lot of local authority properties had oil or electric heating - both of which are becoming increasingly expensive. Ms Peake said some of those seeking in advice did not have the money to buy the minimum 500l. \"It is quite scary for them, thinking that you're going to be cold,\" she said. \"I see people that manage their budgets incredibly well but just can't make their pennies go any further.\" She said a regulator or other legislation was needed to protect people with no option but to use heating oil. Citizens Advice would also like to see the government expand its warm home discount and make it more generous for people on lower incomes, to offset higher energy costs. According to ONS data some 6.7% homes in the east of England are heated using oil. Alison Murray-Brown lives in a four-bedroomed house in Orwell, a village seven miles (11km) outside Cambridge with her husband and dog. The village is not on mains gas. In December they paid £306 for 500 litres. On 2 March she ordered 500 litres to be delivered in two weeks time at a cost of £440. Mrs Murray-Brown said she thought the price a bit \"steep\" until a friend told her two days later that she had paid £770 for the same amount. \"We're neither rich nor poor, we haven't got kids to support but it's absolutely not sustainable for people to be spending in the region of nearly £500 a month to run their heating,\" the financial consultant said. \"That's aside from the fact that electricity bills will be going up as well.\" Mrs Murray-Brown said a number of friends planned to turn their heating off, including one lady in her village with a baby. \"She said we're just going to use our wood burner, we're not going to use anything else,\" she said. \"We're an affluent south Cambs village and I never really thought that 'heat or eat' would really bite home here, it's crazy. \"I think it's absolutely criminal that it (heating oil) is absolutely uncapped so the price has no ceiling on it whatsoever. \"I think the government does have a duty of care, there are people who won't be able to heat there homes here.\" The government said it had no plans to set a price cap on heating oil but added the supply of heating oil and liquid petroleum gas were subject to UK competition law and consumer protection. A spokesperson for the Department for Business, Energy and Industrial Strategy said: \"In the longer term, improving the energy efficiency of our homes and buildings is vital to keeping household energy costs down and reducing carbon emissions, which is why are driving £6bn into making homes more energy efficient over the next ten years.\" Find BBC News: East of England on Facebook, Instagram and Twitter.

            "header": "Ukraine brings significant economic uncertainty, Rishi Sunak warns",
            "content": "Russia's invasion of Ukraine means significant uncertainty for the UK economy, the chancellor has warned. This is despite UK growth bouncing back in January as the effects of the Omicron Covid variant began to ease. The economy grew by 0.8% compared with a 0.2% contraction in December the Office for National Statistics said. But one industry body warned the UK faced a higher risk of recession as the impact of the Ukraine conflict would add to the sharp rise in living costs. UK households were already facing sharply rising costs before Russia's invasion of Ukraine, in part due to soaring energy costs. The conflict in Ukraine pushed the price of oil to its highest level for nearly 14 years at one point and this has had a knock-on impact on fuel costs, with UK petrol prices hitting record highs. Gas prices have also soared, leading to warnings that average energy bills could reach £3,000 per year in October, after rising to £2,000 in April when the energy price cap is raised. Grain prices have also jumped as both Russia and Ukraine are major global producers, particularly of wheat. \"Russia's invasion of Ukraine has increased the risk of a recession in the UK by exacerbating the already acute inflationary squeeze on consumers and businesses and derailing the supply of critical commodities to many sectors of the economy,\" said Suren Thiru from the British Chambers of Commerce (BCC). Mr Thiru said January's growth was now like looking into a rear-view mirror. What is the UK's inflation rate and why is the cost of living going up?\nWhat is GDP and how does it affect me?\nBorrow billions or see incomes hit, Sunak told The bounce back in the economy in January was not just stronger than expected, it was also seen in buoyant tax revenues. The effect of the Omicron Covid variant proved to be a blip, as wholesalers, retailers and IT and communication services pushed growth up. Consumer-facing services - restaurants, bars, entertainment, and travel - are still 6.8% below the level before the pandemic. All in all, the economy was on course to maintain its return to normal after the pandemic. However, the cost of living and energy squeeze was already weighing on the economy. The economic consequences of the Ukraine invasion are pushing both inflation and growth in the wrong direction. While a line may now thankfully be drawn under the pandemic's economic hit, the inflationary cloud is now looking very dark indeed. The ONS figures show the UK's economy rebounded in January, with wholesaling, retailing, restaurants and takeaways all performing well. While supply chain issues continued to dog some sectors, construction and manufacturing both grew, the ONS said. Computer programming and film and TV production also had a good start to the year, said Darren Morgan, ONS director of economic statistics. \"GDP bounced back from the hit it took in December due to the Omicron wave and is now 0.8% above its pre-pandemic peak,\" he said. \"All sectors grew in January with some industries that were hit particularly hard in December now performing well.\" Mr Sunak said that Russia's invasion \"is creating significant economic uncertainty\", but \"it is vital that we stand with the people of Ukraine to uphold our shared values of freedom and democracy and ensure Putin fails\". He added that the government had \"provided unprecedented support\" throughout the Covid pandemic, \"which has put our economy in a strong position to deal with current cost of living challenges\". Labour's shadow chief secretary to the Treasury, Pat McFadden, said households were facing \"a year of surging inflation, weak earnings growth and tax rises\". He called for the government to halt a planned National Insurance increase in April. Mr McFadden also said the government \"must look again at Labour's proposal for a one-off windfall tax on oil and gas producers to cut household energy bills by up to £600\". National Insurance: What's the new Health and Social Care tax and what will it cost me? Paul Dales, chief UK economist at Capital Economics, said that while the economy had \"rebounded with vigour\" in January, \"the cost of living crisis and the influence of the war in Ukraine probably means this is as good as it gets for the year\". He added that growth \"will probably slow throughout the year\". Despite this, Mr Dales still expects the Bank of England to increase interest rates at its meeting on Thursday next week, with the main Bank rate likely to rise from 0.5% to 0.75%. ",

            "content": "Petrol prices have risen above £1.60 a litre on average for the first time as Russia's invasion of Ukraine continues to affect the cost of oil worldwide. Unleaded petrol hit £1.61 a litre on Thursday, having risen by 8p in a week, while diesel reached £1.70 a litre. The RAC said wholesale fuel costs had dropped for two days in a row, but warned prices at the pump are set to remain high for some time. The rise in fuel costs has led to a squeeze on margins for businesses. North East Coach Travel, based in Newcastle upon Tyne, warned it could end up running its services at a loss. Jenna Rush, the firm's managing director, said most of its bookings were agreed last year and did not take into account such a sharp rise in costs sparked by the economic fallout from the Ukraine war. \"It's just awful, it's a very, very stressful time,\" Ms Rush told the BBC's Today programme. \"We tendered as far back as last year for this type of work, no one envisaged that the fuel prices would increase as much as they have. \"At the moment we're scared that we are going to be running at a loss when it keeps increasing.\" Ms Rush warned the rising costs could lead to some operators pulling out of contracts. She said the company was trying to renegotiate prices with customers, but added it was proving \"very, very difficult\". \"The profit margins are too small that we just can't absorb them costs ourselves, not coming off the back of Covid anyway. It's been a very hard two years. We've been beginning to see the green shoots of recovery coming through but now this is just another kick in the teeth.\" The RAC motoring group said it was costing over £88 on average to fill up a car with petrol. It called on the government to reduce VAT on fuel, which it said added 28p on the cost of petrol or diesel per litre. How has Ukraine conflict affected petrol prices?\nFuel price jump will hit food bills, industry says\nCustomers abusing forecourt staff over fuel prices Fuel prices have been rising amid fears of a global economic shock from Russia's invasion of Ukraine. Oil prices are mainly determined by the price of crude oil and the dollar exchange rate, as agreements are made in dollars. Russia is the third largest oil exporter and some Western countries, for example the US and Canada, decided to halt imports from the country in response to Russia's actions. It means demand for oil from other producers has increased, leading to increased prices. At one point Brent crude - the global benchmark for oil prices - jumped to $139 a barrel, the highest level for almost 14 years. The UK only imports about 6% of oil from Russia, so is not as dependent on Russia for the commodity supply as other European countries are and has said it plans to phase it out. It is, however, affected by the global shifts in price. But early on Friday the price of Brent crude was on track for its biggest weekly drop since November and was trading at about $107. The drop in price is party due to reduced fears of a European ban on Russian oil, and partly due to speculation that extra supplies could come onto the market from Iran, Venezuela and the UAE. Yet higher prices at the pumps are likely to remain in the coming weeks, due to the way retailers buy the fuel, Simon Williams, fuel spokesman for the RAC said. \"There is a real hope that these prices will filter through,\" he said. \"We would really hope these drops will take some of the heat out of the rising prices so we won't have records set on a daily basis.\" But Mr Williams said there was a concern retailers might be reluctant to lower their prices for fear of \"catching a cold\" if wholesale costs jump back up again. It means for the time being, firms such as North East Coach Travel will have to continue to bare the brunt of higher fuel prices. \"This could be the straw that breaks the camel's back with some operators where they just hand the contracts back and say, 'I'm done, I can't continue anymore',\" said Ms Rush. \"People are already stressing about how they're going to manage themselves with filling their own car up, paying their own gas and electric that's increasing at home. How are they going to keep managing to pay out for further things?\" The UK is experiencing rising prices for energy, food as well as fuel as the economy recovers from the pandemic, and some expect the inflation rate to reach 8% later this year.

In February 2020, just before the pandemic caused people to stay at home, it was used by 5.4 million. An airport spokesperson said outbound leisure travel was \"recovering strongly\" but demand for inbound flights remained supressed. Coronavirus testing and quarantine requirements still apply in nearly two-thirds of the markets it serves. Heathrow passenger numbers lowest for 50 years\nUK citizens are advised not to travel to Russia The spokesperson added that the industry faced \"headwinds\" resulting from Russia's invasion of Ukraine such as higher fuel prices, longer flight times on routes affected by airspace closures and concerns from US travellers about war in Europe. The likelihood of new coronavirus variants of concern emerging was also a potential threat to growth, the spokesperson said. The latest figures are 15% below what was forecast. However, the spokesperson said the strength of outbound leisure bookings reported by airlines indicated its busiest days this summer could see demand return to 85% of pre-pandemic levels. To cope with the expected increase in passengers, the airport is recruiting 12,000 new staff and plans to reopen Terminal 4 before July.

            "content": "Goldman Sachs has said it will close its operations in Russia, becoming the first Wall Street bank to pull out of the country in response to the invasion of Ukraine. Money transfer giant Western Union has also said it will suspend operations in Russia and Belarus. The firms join a rush of global brands halting operations in Russia. Earlier on Thursday, the owner of Uniqlo made a U-turn and decided to suspend operations in the country. Operating in Moscow has been increasingly difficult for Western financial institutions and other firms amid international sanctions against Russia. More than 330 firms have withdrawn or significantly curtailed operations in the country in recent days, according to Yale researchers, who have been tracking the corporate response. On Thursday, Goldman Sachs said it would be \"winding down\" its business in Russia rather than leaving immediately. The bank said it was doing so \"in compliance with regulatory and licensing requirements\". At the end of 2021, Goldman Sachs' total credit exposure in Russia was $650m (£496m). Later Thursday, fellow Wall Street giant JP Morgan Chase also said it was \"actively unwinding Russian business\", with activities focused on taking care of staff and helping global clients manage risk and close out obligations. Meanwhile Western Union said it \"stands with the world in condemning the unprovoked and unjustified invasion of Ukraine\". \"Ultimately, in light of the ongoing tragic impact of Russia's prolonged assault on Ukraine, we have arrived at the decision to suspend our operations in Russia and Belarus,\" the company said. The action is a further blow to flows of money in Russia. Western Union provides international money transfer and payments services in more than 200 countries and 130 currencies. In an interview with the BBC published today, Ukrainain Central Bank Governor Kyrylo Shevchenko had called on Western Union to \"cease deliveries of cash to Russian and Belarusian banks.\" What sanctions are being imposed on Russia? Earlier on Thursday, Uniqlo owner Fast Retailing said it had decided to change its stance on continuing trading in Russia. It said it was faced with \"operational challenges\" due to the \"worsening of the conflict situation\" after Russia's invasion of Ukraine. Earlier in the week it had said it would keep its Russian shops open, saying that clothing is a \"necessity of life\". But in its latest statement, it said Uniqlo could \"no longer proceed\" in Russia. \"Uniqlo has made everyday clothing available to the general public in Russia,\" it said. \"However, we have recently faced a number of difficulties, including operational challenges and the worsening of the conflict situation. For this reason, we will temporarily suspend our operations.\" Why the world is waging economic war on Russia\nUkraine war is economic catastrophe, warns World Bank Among the latest wave of companies to call a halt to trading or pull back from investing in Russia, Rio Tinto became the first major mining company to cut ties with Russian businesses, while Japan's Sony and Nintendo suspended deliveries of gaming consoles. The world's biggest insurance broker, New York-listed Marsh McLennan, also announced it would exit Russia on Thursday. Ownership of its Russian businesses will be transferred to local management that will be independently operated, the group said. Japanese firm Hitachi said it would stop exports and cease most operations in Russia except for vital electrical power facilities, following similar moves by US companies such as Caterpillar. \"We took multiple factors including the supply chain situation into account,\" a Hitachi spokesperson said. Ukraine's Vice Prime Minister Mykhailo Fedorov had been urging the suspension. Entertainment giant Sony, which had already stopped releasing films in Russia, suspended the launch of racing game \"Gran Turismo 7\". Food companies Nestle, Mondelez, Procter & Gamble and Unilever have halted investment in Russia, but said they would continue providing essentials. McDonald's said on Tuesday that it would temporarily close its 847 Russian outlets. The fast food giant has said that the move, which includes continuing to pay its 62,000 staff and restaurant employees in Russia, will cost about $50m (£38m) a month. \"This is a really challenging and complex situation for a global company like us,\" said chief financial officer Kevin Ozan. A number of other US food retailers, including Starbucks, PepsiCo and Coca-Cola Co, have said they will stop some or all business in Russia following the Ukraine invasion. Meanwhile Burger King has suspended all of its corporate support, marketing and investment in Russia. But as its Russian outlets are fully franchised, many will remain open as they are managed by local franchisees. On Thursday, Russia's Izvestia newspaper reported that the Russian government had put together a list of about 60 foreign companies that could be nationalised in response to the suspension of operations. It said firms including Apple, Ikea, Microsoft, IBM, Shell, McDonald's, Porsche, Toyota and H&M could have their accounts and assets seized, and \"external management\" brought in, BBC News Moscow producer Will Vernon said. It is unclear how the nationalised companies would be able to sell the products associated with those firms. In response to Western sanctions, Russia has imposed export bans on a string of products until the end of 2022. The ban covers exports of telecoms, medical, vehicle, agricultural, and electrical equipment, as well as some forestry products such as timber. Meanwhile in the UK, the CBI business lobby group called for government support as Western economies cope with the repercussions from Russia's invasion of Ukraine. The CBI said it \"fully supports\" the sanctions that have been placed on Russia \"despite their cost\". But its director general Tony Danker said the UK government must help businesses cope with the fallout such as rising energy costs and inflation as well as any impact on investment. He said the UK and other countries \"now need to confront the economic consequences of unwinding from Russia\". The CBI wants the government to \"fast-track progress on some of the big policy issues and help firms invest\". Mr Danker called for an acceleration of renewable energy and government support on energy bills, especially for energy intensive industries. He also asked for the UK government \"to stand behind domestic oil and gas in our energy transition\" while the country should also \"identify new trading partners\" for minerals and other commodities, and enhance cyber security.

            "header": "Rising fuel and food costs push US inflation to 7.9%",
            "content": "Price increases in the US continued to surge last month, pushing the annual inflation rate up 7.9%. That is the biggest year-on-year leap since 1982 and up from the 7.5% rate reported in January. Rising costs for energy, food and shelter drove the gains, which are squeezing household incomes. President Joe Biden and central bank officials are under pressure to rein in the increases, which have proven more persistent than many expected. The Federal Reserve - the US central bank - is widely expected to raise interest rates at its meeting this month. In the UK - where inflation hit 5.5% in January - the Bank of England has already increased rates, while the European Central Bank on Thursday said it would wind down some of its pandemic-era stimulus sooner than expected in response to the price pressures. At a news conference, ECB president Christine Lagarde said: \"The risks to the economic outlook have increased substantially with the Russian invasion of Ukraine and are tilted to the downside\". The war will have \"a material impact on economic activity and inflation through higher energy and commodity prices, the disruption of international commerce and weaker confidence\", she warned. Oil price rises due to fears over Russian shortfall\nUkraine war is economic catastrophe - World Bank\nUS jobs growth stronger than expected The US and other parts of the world have already been grappling with high inflation for months, as a surge in demand, fuelled in part by pandemic aid, ran into supply constraints, labour shortages and other issues. The war in Ukraine has added to the problems, driving a global surge in energy prices as the West and allies shun oil from Russia - typically responsible for about 7% of global supply. Energy prices in the US jumped 3.5% in February, driven by a 6.6% leap in gasoline prices, according to the Labor Department's monthly report on consumer prices. Over the past 12 months, the energy index has soared more than 25%, with gasoline surging 38%. Americans who own SUVs are now paying an average of $110 per month more than a year ago to operate their vehicle, according to research from Cox Automotive. Even drivers of hybrids have seen monthly costs jump about $40, the firm estimated. The surge in energy costs will push up prices far beyond the gas pump, said Matt Smith, an oil analyst at Kpler. \"We're focused on that headline crude number, but that crude is used as an input to produce all manner of products,\" he said. Grocery prices in the US jumped 1.4% last month, driven by rising costs for meat, fruits and vegetables. They are up 8.6% year-on-year - the largest annual leap since 1981. Analysts expect the increased costs of energy and other commodities due to the war will push US inflation even higher in March, hitting 8% or more. As the rising costs outpace wage gains, they have hurt consumer sentiment, creating a political problem for President Joe Biden. He has been criticised by Republicans on the issue, which few economists expect to ease in the near-term. \"Inflation continues on at a blazing pace,\" Wells Fargo economist Sarah House said. \"Consumers and policymakers remain in a deeply uncomfortable state as a result.\" ",

            "content": "Increased fuel prices will lead to people paying more for food in shops and restaurants, an industry trade body has said. The high cost of diesel will end up being passed on to customers, the Federation of Wholesale Distributors said. Surging fuel prices come on top of other pressures on shops including labour shortages, retailers said. Households are facing a cost of living crisis as inflation soars. With fuel prices hitting record levels, the trade body for UK wholesalers has told the BBC that its members will pass on increased transportation costs to their food shops and restaurant customers, who will in turn pass on those costs to consumers. \"Food price inflation is already happening, but this is going to make it worse, because there'll be charges passed on to customers and then obviously to end users as well,\" said James Bielby, chief executive of the Federation of Wholesale Distributors. \"So, people buying food and drink in shops, when they're eating out, will be paying more because the cost of distributing those goods to the outlet has gone up so much.\" Fuel prices: Customers abusing forecourt staff as costs soar\nUkraine war: Cost of filling diesel family car hits record £90 Fuel prices are rising amid fears of a global economic shock from Russia's invasion of Ukraine. The prices are mainly determined by the price of crude oil and the dollar exchange rate, as agreements are made in dollars. At one point this week oil jumped to $139 a barrel at one point, the highest level for almost 14 years, before slipping slightly. Philip de Ternant is managing director of Creed Food Service. His 80 lorries make 3,500 food deliveries per week to restaurants, cafes, pubs, care homes and schools across England and Wales The cost of diesel has become a major headache. The business is paying £13,200 a week more than it was at the start of the year. \"We buy on card at fuel stations, but the majority is fuelled up on site with bunkered fuel. We're buying 33,000 litres a week on average. \"In January 2021, we were buying at 92p a litre. This January, we were buying on average £1.17 a litre. In February, on average it was £1.21.\" This week, he was shocked at the cost. \"We've bought at £1.55, and I've been told by our fuel wholesaler it could be £1.70 next week. \" Mr de Ternant said some diesel suppliers had told him they could not deliver until next Wednesday at the earliest, and could not say what the price would be. He said the cost could not be absorbed in what is a low-margin industry. \"We will have to find a mechanism, whether it's a price increase on everything, or a surcharge on every delivery - and I have to do it quick.\" He acknowledges not all customers will be happy, but believes all his competitors will be having the same conversations. \"I'm exhausted. None of us saw this coming. It has been relentless, the last two years, for every leader of a foodservice business.\" The Federation of Wholesale Distributors represents 600 firms that deliver food and drink to retail, hospitality and the public sector, such as schools and care homes. Some firms get diesel for their vehicles delivered in bulk to their premises, but others buy at forecourts. Mr Bielby said: \"If you're distributing goods around the network, fuel costs will be 25% to 30% of your distribution costs. \"Those wholesalers who are buying on what's known as the spot market are seeing their costs go up by as much as 50% per litre. So it's a huge impact, and that then leads to a surcharge on customers.\" He said some larger businesses who had hedged, or bought their fuel in advance, weren't yet as affected, but were likely to feel the impact when current contracts came to an end. He said the latest fuel rises were adding to existing cost pressures. \"When you're thinking about all of the other pressures in the supply chain which have been going on for the last two years and beyond, it makes it really, really difficult. \"And that ultimately means that consumers are having to spend more on food on drink at a time when their energy bills are going up, at a time when the cost of living is going up hugely.\" Mr Bielby said that if prices remained high, operators which bought fuel on the spot would also choose to fill up tanks only partially, for cashflow reasons. This could mean some harder-to-reach areas would be supplied less frequently. \"So if they get deliveries every other day, that might go to once a week. This would mean the choice and range of products they get will go down. \"That would be typically be areas at the end of the distribution line, so rural communities or coastal towns,\" he said. Many wholesalers had already been bracing for added costs from April, when they would no longer be allowed to use cheaper red diesel to run their refrigeration units or freezers, he added. It's not only distribution and haulage firms who are feeling the impact. Olivia Bell runs Countrywide Coaches in Buckinghamshire with her husband. Their 14 coaches are used for a variety of work including day trips, and a council home-to-school transport contract. Countrywide has just been quoted just over £14,000 for their standard 6,000 litre delivery, which would be expected to last about a week. That's nearly double what they would have paid in September. \"It's a massive problem, it seems to be swallowing all of our money. We've only just got over Covid, just starting to pick up again, then we've been hit with this. There's no respite.\" \"We've got no choice but to put some prices up\", she says, \"because it's not sustainable\". But she adds there's no room for manoeuvre when it comes to the council contract. Fuel price rises are coming on top of cost pressures that retailers are already facing, said industry body the British Retail Consortium. Labour shortages, higher prices for raw materials, and higher energy prices mean that consumers are likely to continue to pay more until those pressure ease, it said.. Andrew Opie, director of food and sustainability at the BRC, said: \"Rising fuel prices are putting further pressure on retail supply chains, pushing up the cost of shipping, heavy goods transport, and final mile delivery.

            "header": "War in Ukraine: Russia soon unable to pay its debts, warns agency",
            "content": "Russia will soon be unable to pay its debts, according to a leading credit ratings agency. Fitch Ratings downgraded its view of the country's government debt, warning a default is \"imminent\". The move comes amid increasing international sanctions against Russia following its invasion of Ukraine. A credit rating is intended to help investors understand the level of risk they face in buying a country's debt - or bonds. A low rating means the chances of not getting repaid is considered to be high - and so an investor will charge more to lend to that country. This week, Moscow itself said its bond payments may be affected by sanctions. The ratings cut - to C from B - is the second time this month Fitch has downgraded its view of Russia's ability to pay its debts. \"This rating action follows our downgrade... on 2 March, and developments since then have, in our view, further undermined Russia's willingness to service government debt,\" the agency said. \"The further ratcheting up of sanctions, and proposals that could limit trade in energy, increase the probability of a policy response by Russia that includes at least selective non-payment of its sovereign debt obligations,\" it added. The announcement from Fitch came after the US and UK said they will ban Russian oil, as they step up the economic response to the invasion of Ukraine. US President Joe Biden said the move targeted \"the main artery of Russia's economy\". Meanwhile, the European Union said it will end its reliance on Russian gas. As a major exporter of energy, the measures are aimed to hit Moscow's finances, although experts warn this is also likely to send the price of oil and natural gas higher on global markets. West hits Russia with oil bans and gas curbs\nWhat sanctions are being imposed on Russia? On Sunday, Moscow told investors that it would continue to service its sovereign debt. However, it warned that international sanctions imposed on its energy industry could limit its ability and willingness to meet its obligations. \"The actual possibility of making such payments to non-residents will depend on the limiting measures introduced by foreign states in relation to the Russian Federation,\" the finance ministry said in a statement. In recent days, rival ratings agencies Moody's Investors Service and S&P Global Ratings have also slashed their assessments of Russian sovereign debt. It means the country's sovereign debt is now considered to be below investment grade, or in \"junk\" territory, by three of the world's major ratings companies. S&P said its move followed measures it believed would \"substantially increase the risk of default\". Shane Oliver of investment management company AMP Capital believes a default on Russian debt was \"effectively already occurring\". \"It will only service it in much depreciated roubles anyway and foreign investors are offloading it at fire sale prices. Fortunately the global exposure to it is relatively low,\" he told the BBC. The Russian rouble has also hit record lows as countries around the world imposed increasingly tough sanctions on the country. Last month, Russia's central bank more than doubled its interest rate to 20% in an attempt to stop the value of its currency from sliding further. Dozens of global brands - including McDonald's, Coca-Cola and Starbucks - have halted business in Russia due to the invasion of Ukraine. ",

Many international firms that rely on production plants and customer bases in Russia have chosen to stay in the country. Though, food and drink giants McDonald's and Coca-Cola have announced plans to close operations in Russia after being criticised, Burger King and KFC restaurants remain open. Yum Brands, the owner of KFC and Pizza Hut, said it had suspended all investment in Russia \"while we continue to assess additional options\". The company - which has about 1,000 KFC outlets and 50 Pizza Hut restaurants in Russia mostly run by franchisees - is not pulling out of the country, but says it will \"redirect all profits from operations in Russia to humanitarian efforts\". Meanwhile, Restaurant Brands International, which owns Burger King, said it would redirect its profits from more than 800 franchised operations in Russia to humanitarian efforts. It has also committed $3m (£2.3m) to support Ukrainian refugees and said people feeling to European nations could get free Whopper meal vouchers. The world's largest yoghurt maker, French firm Danone, has said it will not commit new investment to Russia but will continue to sell dairy, water bottles and baby food in the country. \"It is very easy to get drawn into black-and-white thinking and demagogic positions, but in the end our reputation is about our behaviour,\" chief executive Antoine de Saint-Affrique told the Financial Times. \"We have a responsibility to the people we feed, the farmers who provide us with milk, and the tens of thousands of people who depend on us.\" Danone has 8,000 workers across 10 sites in Russia. Tobacco giant Philip Morris International was the leading foreign company by revenue in Russia in 2020. It has suspended operations in Ukraine but not Russia. Japan Tobacco, which has a 37% share of the Russian market and 4,500 employees in the country, also continues to operate in Russia. Its tax payments in 2020 accounted for 1.4% of the Russian Federation state budget according to the company's website. Japan Tobacco says it is \"fully committed\" to complying with national and international sanctions. British American Tobacco (BAT) has 2,500 workers across 76 offices in Russia and continues to sell cigarettes in the country where it has operated for more than 30 years. \"BAT always complies with relevant regulation and legislation wherever we operate, and we are aligned with all international sanctions,\" a spokesperson told the BBC. \"We continue to closely monitor the situation as it evolves.\" Russia is carmaker Renault's second-biggest market and accounts for around 12% of Renault's revenue, about $5.5bn (£4.2bn). The French government currently has a 15% stake in Renault and is its most important investor in terms of voting rights. The French company has not made any statements on the issue and has not responded to the BBC's request for comment. Anglo-Dutch consumer goods giant Unilever has suspended all imports and exports of products into and out of Russia, and has stopped all new investment, media and advertising in the country. However, the firm said it will continue to supply its \"everyday essential food and hygiene products made in Russia\" to people in the country. Operations at the firm's sites in Moscow, Omsk, Saint-Petersburg, Ekaterinburg and Tula remain open. Unilever - whose brands include Marmite, Ben & Jerry's ice cream, Domestos and Dove - employs 3,000 people in Russia. Nestle, which made $1.7bn from Russian sales in 2020, has six factories in Russia making snacks and drinks. The firm says it has \"business continuity plans in place that can be activated as needed\". \"The safety and protection of our employees remains our highest priority. We will not speculate on any potential sanctions. Responding to Ukrainian deputy prime minister Mykhailo Fedorov's letter and tweet calling on the company to leave Russia, Japanese conglomerate Hitachi said it \"continues to monitor the situation closely\".

MPs on the current and former Treasury Committees are concerned that the wrong people may have been prosecuted. The Serious Fraud office told BBC News it had run a thorough investigation.

It revealed that two traders jailed for rigging interest rates, Peter Johnson and Colin Bermingham, were the original whistleblowers of the scandal. In the Radio 4 podcast The Lowball Tapes, the BBC revealed leaked audio recordings and documents that implicate both the Bank of England and the government in pressuring banks to rig interest rates. The audio recordings and documents were never seen by a previous parliamentary inquiry into the scandal in 2012. Much of the evidence was also never shown to juries in nine rate-rigging trials of traders and brokers that were held between 2015 and 2019. A total of 38 traders were prosecuted, 24 of them in the UK. After nine criminal trials on both sides of the Atlantic, 11 were convicted. Andrew Tyrie, who chaired the committee that investigated the scandal in 2012, told the BBC if they'd known what the BBC has since discovered they would have investigated further, changing the context in which decisions were taken to prosecute 24 traders. \"People have had their lives badly shaken up. And they've had terrible experiences from the trials,\" he said. \"From what I can tell the whistleblowers were, as the name suggests, trying to do the right thing. Whistleblowing is a crucial part of investigative machinery. And it's very important, it should be seen to function well. And it doesn't seem to work in this case.\" The case against the convicted traders was separate to any intervention involving the Bank of England. They were alleged to have entered a conspiracy to commit fraud by asking colleagues to tweak estimates of interest rates up or down by a hundredth of a percentage point (known as a \"basis point\"). What the FTSE 100 is to share prices, Libor is to interest rates – an index that tracks the cost of borrowing cash. For most of the past 35 years, 16 banks have answered a question every morning at 11am: At what interest rate could you borrow money? They submit their answers (e.g. RBS estimates 3.14%, Lloyds 3.13% etc) and an average is taken to get Libor, short for \"London Interbank Offered Rate\". To set Euribor, the process is similar but with more banks involved. The evidence against the traders jailed for rate \"rigging\" consisted entirely of requests they had made to colleagues to tweak those estimated interest rates up or down, typically by one hundredth of a percentage point (known on the money markets as a \"basis point\"). The hope was that it might shift the Libor average marginally in the right direction to benefit the bank’s trades which went up or down linked to Libor. In the other form of rate rigging, known as lowballing, banks pretend to be able to borrow cash much more cheaply than they really can. It is on a much larger scale. The evidence kept from Andrew Tyrie's committee 10 years ago includes a tape, known to regulators who appeared before the committee, where Barclays trader Peter Johnson is told by his boss Mark Dearlove that the bank has had \"very serious pressure from the UK government and the Bank of England about pushing our Libors lower\". However, those who gave instructions from above have never been prosecuted. The Lowball Tapes also reveal that Mr Dearlove says he was pressured directly by then Bank of England executive director Paul Tucker earlier that month that Barclays' Libor rate should be \"put down\" because it was receiving attention from the government. Evidence uncovered for the series also suggests that as it sought to manage the credit crunch and the banking crisis that followed it, the Bank of England was intervening in the Libor setting process starting in August 2007. Emails and sworn testimony never shown to MPs nor juries suggest the Bank of England first agreed that senior bank executives should collectively raise Libor on 14 August 2007 because it was too low to reflect the interest rates where cash was changing hands. It then intervened to tell Barclays to lower its Libor submissions on 1 September 2007 following speculation about the bank's solvency. It also shows that Barclays cash traders Peter Johnson and Colin Bermingham had sought to blow the whistle on lowballing throughout the crisis. But far from being thanked, they were separately prosecuted for a far smaller form of interest rate \"rigging\" which is now not regarded as a crime in the United States Barclays' legal department, the UK regulator the Financial Services Authority and the US Department of Justice all had access to this evidence. Yet there was no mention it in the regulatory notices published at the time and no-one informed MPs about it. The call for a fresh investigation is supported by three other former and current members of the Treasury Committee. \"It needs a new full, judge-led inquiry,\" said Treasury committee member and campaigner against financial corruption, Kevin Hollinrake. \"You cannot have a situation where the rule-setters, the 'masters of the universe' go by one set of rules and the rest of us go by another. \"I don't care who these people are: what level of government, what level of the Bank of England, or what level of the FCA - or what level of the banks they're working in. These people have to play by the rules. So there should be an inquiry and investigation to see if they have.\" Mark Garnier, who sat on the 2012 committee that was told the Bank of England hadn't put pressure on Barclays, said if he were now chairman of the Treasury committee he'd be ordering hearings to get to the truth. Teresa Pearce, a member of the same 2012 committee, said the evidence uncovered by the BBC showed the investigation needed reopening. Paul Tucker has declined to comment in response to a BBC right of reply. Barclays didn't respond to our request for comment but former executives have denied they came under pressure from the Bank of England to lower Libor. The Bank of England has also denied that it put pressure on banks and said Libor was not regulated at the time. The US Federal Reserve declined to comment. But in a statement from 2012, it said it had received \"occasional anecdotal reports from Barclays of problems with Libor\" in 2007, and shared suggestions for reform with relevant UK authorities. ",

            "header": "Higher energy bills 'almost inevitable' says Ofgem",
            "content": "Households are heading for an \"almost inevitable\" rise in energy bills in the autumn, the boss of energy regulator Ofgem has said. Spikes in wholesale gas prices, which were rising even before Russia's invasion of Ukraine, will be passed on to consumers, Jonathan Brearley said. He called for the shift to green energy to speed up the move away from gas. The UK government has previously said the energy price cap would \"insulate\" customers from gas price rises. Mr Brearley warned in a speech that the gas price volatility caused by Russia's invasion of Ukraine would lead to higher costs being passed on to consumers. \"While it is too early to predict what the price cap will be in October, a price increase is almost inevitable,\" he said. The energy price cap is the maximum amount that suppliers in England, Scotland and Wales can charge customers for each unit of energy. It is set to rise in April when millions of households will face an increase in average energy bills of nearly £700. In October, the price cap will be reset, and Ofgem warned last week that average bills could reach £3,000. Wholesale gas prices, which were already rising rapidly as economies were emerging from the coronavirus pandemic, will be pushed higher by the Ukraine crisis, Mr Brearley said. Russia's invasion of Ukraine underlined that \"it is not in consumers' interests for their energy sources or prices to be so exposed to international gas markets\". Britain's oil and gas supplies are secure due to North Sea reserves, he said. But oil and gas extracted from the North Sea is not owned by the UK itself, but by the oil and gas companies which drill for it. Those products are then sold on the global market which has been volatile, even before Russia's invasion of Ukraine. Why are gas bills so high and what's the energy price cap?\nEnergy bills could reach £3,000 as oil and gas prices soar \"We started winter with an international gas price shock of unprecedented pace, scale and duration,\" Mr Brearley said. \"However, this gas crisis is not over. We are entering a second, more serious phase that will have further consequences for customers and further financial strain for retail companies,\" he added, saying gas had gone up to nearly £7 per therm this week alone. \"It is not in customers' interests for their household bills to be beholden to the uncertainties of geopolitics,\" he said. Some Conservative MPs, most notably the Net Zero Scrutiny Group, have argued for a greater reliance on fossil fuels. But Mr Brearley said we must move away from fossil fuels not only to tackle climate change, but also to move away from volatile prices. He said the UK must move as quickly as possible to low carbon energy. Mr Brearley said it was Ofgem's priority to manage and mitigate the \"inevitable consequences\" of rising energy prices on British consumers but he said that \"as an industry, we cannot pretend that our actions can mitigate the full impact of future price rises\". He said that anyone struggling to pay their bills should contact their energy provider to find out what help was available, but also urged companies to \"reach out\" to their most vulnerable customers and support them where possible. Prime Minister Boris Johnson on Monday said that the government will soon set out an \"energy supply strategy\" amid concern over western reliance on Russian gas and oil. He said the government was looking at using more UK energy resources: \"One of the things we're looking at is the possibility of using more of our own hydrocarbons.\" \"That doesn't mean that we are in any way abandoning our commitment to reducing carbon dioxide [emissions].\" \"You can do that, but you've got to reflect the reality that there is a crunch on at the moment and we need to intensify our self-reliance as a transition with more hydrocarbons.\" ",

            "content": "The hospitality industry was among the hardest hit during the coronavirus pandemic, but as it begins to pick up now all restrictions have come to an end, the people behind the scenes at restaurants, bars and hotels are determined to be a success. To mark International Women's Day, three leading figures from Birmingham city centre's entertainment district, which itself has seen a string of new venues open recently despite the uncertain climate, share their stories of striving to get to the top of their game. When Vic Platt entered the wine industry in 2012, women were \"few and far between\". \"When I first started, so many older guys - proper wine buffs - would come into the shop and bar and I would ask if they needed any help and they would just ignore me,\" she said. \"But I felt the class thing was more of an issue, it is an elite group really - everyone who works and is drawn into the industry is from an upper middle class background.\" After almost a decade in the industry - and managing an independent wine merchants in Digbeth, Birmingham - she said she felt she had helped \"pave the way for other people\". \"I have never hired to tick boxes,\" she said. \"I have tried to get a good range of people, people from a working class background and ethnic minorities; you don't see black and Asian people in the wine industry either, it is very rare.\" Vic got into wine \"quite accidentally\", working part-time in a wine bar while studying for a fine art degree. But she said she \"quickly made herself indispensable\" and grew to be operations manager running three sites. Her career has allowed her to travel the world on business trips selecting wines. \"I have been to New Zealand, Argentina, all over Europe, all over Australia visiting incredible vineyards and wineries and meeting Rockstar wine makers,\" she said. \"I have had the opportunity to travel the world and try the most legendary wines people only dream of trying, especially for someone with my working class background.\" She said Wine Freedom strived to make wine more accessible, holding a range of unusual events including Wine and Wings, where participants learn which wine goes best with junk food. \"If I was to give advice to someone trying to do something similar it would be: Know what your strengths are and mould your role for yourself,\" she said. \"Part of why I climbed so quickly initially was because I knew what I was good at and used it to make the company better - I carved a role that wasn't there before.\" The week Laura Orrell began her job at the Grand Hotel in Birmingham, following a refurbishment, England went into its first lockdown. The anticipated grand opening was halted, hoards of expectant customers did not arrive. And no-one at the hotel, which had just undergone a £45m restoration, knew what the future held. What was meant to be an initial three-month period in Laura's director of sales position, promoting the business ahead of its opening, became more than a year. \"It was challenging and I would say at points quite heart-breaking,\" she said. \"You have done all of this work, spoken to all the customers, driven that awareness; they are really excited to start booking and you can't even open the doors.\" When the Grand finally opened in May 2021, she said it was \"incredible\". \"I couldn't have wished for it to have gone any better than it has,\" she said. \"The whole city was really behind us getting the doors open.\" Her journey to the Grand began with a business and tourism management degree at the University of Coventry, despite initially choosing it because she \"didn't know what I wanted to do\". \"I picked something I enjoyed, I enjoyed hospitality, I enjoyed the business element,\" she said. But her drive led her to climbing the ladder in a conference company before moving to Q Hotels as a sales manager and rising to become its director of sales, where she said she \"went in, turned a hotel around and moved on to the next location\". \"I put a lot of pressure on myself, I always want to be the best,\" she said. \"I love hotels - it is my absolute passion. Where I am now, I couldn't be more proud to say I am director of sales. That is what drives me every day and our amazing customers keep me going and keep me sane.\" While the impact of Covid-19 is still being felt, she said her dream was to keep growing her team at the Grand. \"I definitely think 'Goodness, I've opened a hotel in the middle of a global pandemic'. It is a pretty big achievement,\" she added. \"It is so normal to me now, it is only when I speak to someone else I feel proud - it has been a been a journey,\" Ellesse Holness told the BBC. She began working as a dancer at 18, which eventually grew to her current role curating entertainment at the recently-opened Albert's Schloss in Birmingham. Being at the \"top of her game\" as a dancer, which took her across Europe, she said she had struggled to keep up with demand and eventually began managing other dancers - something she did for eight years. \"I'll be honest, at the beginning I do feel like it was a bit of 'fake it until you make it' - I didn't know what I was doing,\" she said. \"I think I learned how to talk to people, I was really good at selling - people always trusted me because I had good confidence.\" When Albert's Schloss opened in December, she became its entertainment manager and said as well as enjoying seeing customers \"having the time of their lives\", she loved building relationships between the performers and seeing them enjoying their shows. End of restrictions leads to hope for trade boost\nThe women behind the male DJs on the decks\n'You can do it too' - woman aims to inspire others \"The fact they want to work more is always a good thing,\" she said. Alongside all of that, she works as a model for brands including Pretty Little Thing and one of the biggest challenges she faces is balance. \"At first it was difficult; before Schloss I never physically had to be there, I could manage from home,\" she said. \"My modelling is based in Manchester and I [sometimes] have to be on set at nine, so sometimes I will finish at Schloss at 1am or 2am then have to be Manchester for nine the next day. \"It was a lot at first, but I'm adapting to it now. \"Organisation is so important, you need to make sure everyone knows what they are doing, you can be sending people to do a job, forget the smallest detail and it could be a shambles. \"I think you have just got to be passionate, so, so passionate, you've got to want it,\" she added. \"With anything there's a lot of bits to love, but there's always times you will feel like giving up... you have got to want it so bad otherwise you won't have the energy and motivation to climb up obstacles.\" Follow BBC West Midlands on Facebook, Twitter and Instagram.

            "header": "War in Ukraine: Russia says it may cut gas supplies if oil ban goes ahead",
            "content": "Russia has said it may close its main gas pipeline to Germany if the West goes ahead with a ban on Russian oil. Deputy Prime Minister Alexander Novak said a \"rejection of Russian oil would lead to catastrophic consequences for the global market\", causing prices to more than double to $300 a barrel. The US has been exploring a potential ban with allies as a way of punishing Russia for its invasion of Ukraine. But Germany and the Netherlands rejected the plan on Monday. The EU gets about 40% of its gas and 30% of its oil from Russia, and has no easy substitutes if supplies are disrupted. While the UK would not be directly impacted by supply disruption, as it imports less than 5% of its gas from Russia, it would be affected by prices rising in the global markets as demand in Europe increases. Iain Conn, the former boss of British Gas owner Centrica, said natural gas was \"less freely\" traded compared to oil, and it would be \"much more difficult\" to replace Russian gas if supplies are affected as it is transported through fixed pipelines from country to country. The price of Brent crude - the global benchmark for oil prices - rose to around $130 a barrel on Tuesday following reports that the US and UK will announce its own ban on Russian oil imports. In an address on Russian state television, Mr Novak said it would be \"impossible to quickly find a replacement for Russian oil on the European market\". \"It will take years, and it will still be much more expensive for European consumers. Ultimately, they will be hurt the worst by this outcome,\" he said. Pointing to Germany's decision last month to freeze certification of Nord Stream 2, a new gas pipeline connecting the two countries, he added that an oil embargo could prompt retaliation. \"We have every right to take a matching decision and impose an embargo on gas pumping through the [existing] Nord Stream 1 gas pipeline,\" he said. Could the world survive without Russian oil?\nCould EU weaponise energy in Russia crisis?\nPetrol at fresh record as oil and gas prices soar Russia is the world's second largest gas producer and third largest oil exporter, and any move to impose sanctions on its energy industry would badly damage its own economy. Nathan Piper, head of oil and gas research at Investec, said although imposing sanctions on Russia's oil and gas exports was attractive, \"practically it is challenging\". He said both the global oil and gas markets were tight ahead of the war in Ukraine \"with limited spare capacity to replace any disrupted Russian volumes\". \"The question is now whether US and European leaders are prepared to endure high oil and gas prices to add energy exports to the sanctions list,\" he told the BBC. \"The threat of this action is almost the worst of both worlds, forcing prices up but doing nothing to limit Russian volumes or the revenues flowing to Moscow.\" Analysts at Capital Economics have forecast oil prices could rise to $160 a barrel if the West imposed sanctions on Russian exports, but David Oxley, senior global economist at the consultancy, told the BBC it was disruption to Russian gas that would hit countries harder, describing it as a \"completely different kettle of fish\". He said energy intensive industries across Europe could be hit, with \"vast swathes of heavy industry being switched off\" as it is much harder finding replacement gas suppliers compared with oil. EU countries heavily reliant on Russian gas, such as Germany, could switch from gas to coal, he said, but that would run counter to the bloc's climate ambitions and would not be a long-term solution. The energy markets have been supremely volatile over the past week, and understandably so. There are genuine fears that supplies of oil and gas from Russia could be cut off or disrupted. Yet the response to Russia's suggestion it could close a major pipeline, depriving northern Europe of a large chunk of its gas supplies, has been pretty muted so far. There are a couple of reasons for this. Firstly, Russia is threatening a tit-for-tat embargo - cutting off its gas exports if the West goes ahead with a ban on Russian oil. But despite pressure from the US, such a ban is unlikely. European leaders have already poured cold water on the idea - so Russia's counter-threat carries relatively little weight. And then there's the fact that Russia is still making huge sums from sales of oil and gas to Europe every day, helping to fund its war. Moscow has everything to gain from exploiting traders' nerves to push up energy prices; but a great deal to lose if it were to carry out its threat. Ukraine has implored the West to adopt an oil and gas ban, but there are concerns it would send prices soaring. Investor fears of an embargo drove Brent crude oil to $139 (£106) a barrel at one point on Monday - its highest level for almost 14 years. Meanwhile, wholesale gas prices rose to 565p per therm early on Tuesday, but fell to 480p in the afternoon. UK stock markets rose slightly in early trading after a volatile Monday caused by the US's discussions over a potential Russian oil and gas ban. Early on Tuesday, nickel prices on the London Metal Exchange more than doubled to rise above the $100,000-a-tonne level for the first time, before trading in the metal was suspended. Russia supplies the world with about 10% of its nickel needs, mainly for use in stainless steel and electric vehicle batteries. Quoting unnamed sources, Reuters news agency reported that the US might be willing to move ahead with an embargo without its allies, although it only gets about 3% of its oil from Russia. However, German Chancellor Olaf Scholz has dismissed the idea of a wider ban, saying Europe had \"deliberately exempted\" Russian energy from sanctions because its supply could not be secured \"any other way\" at the moment. European powers have, however, committed to move away from Russian hydrocarbons over time, while some Western companies have boycotted Russian shipments or pledged to sell their stakes in Russian energy companies. Mr Novak said that Russian companies were already feeling the pressure of US and European moves to lower the dependence on Russian energy, despite fulfilling all its contractual obligations to deliver oil and gas to Europe. \"We are concerned by the discussion and statements we are seeing regarding a possible embargo on Russian oil and petrochemicals, on phasing them out,\" he said.

            "content": "Bakery chain Greggs has warned that its prices could go up for a second time this year as it faces surging costs. Higher prices for food, energy and staff, plus tax changes mean the company's own costs will rise by between 6% and 7% it said. The chain, known for its sausage rolls and steak bakes, put prices up at the start of the year and it expects \"further changes\" to be necessary. The UK cost of living is rising at the fastest pace for 30 years. Greggs said the cost of raw materials had gone up while energy prices are also soaring. While it has locked in prices for some commodities ahead of time, the company said future costs remain \"uncertain\". Energy prices around the world began to rise sharply as economies started to recover from the coronavirus pandemic, and have surged further as Russia's invasion of Ukraine continues. Labour costs have also increased for businesses as job vacancies have reached record highs. Greggs said that overall wages at the company increased by 3% last year, and it had brought forward a planned 2022 pay rise by five months, adding £4.5m to its costs. While average pay in the UK has been going up, it has been lagging behind increases in the cost of living - adding to the squeeze on households' finances. Living costs rising at their fastest rate for 30 years\nWhat is the UK's inflation rate and why is the cost of living going up? Greggs also noted that would face an increase in the rate of National Insurance on wages and salaries in April. The chain said rising costs \"necessitated some price increases, which were made at the start of this year, and further changes are expected to be necessary\". \"As ever, we will work to mitigate the impact of this on customers,\" it said, adding that it did not expect a \"material\" rise in profits for the year ahead. The comments triggered a near 9% fall in Greggs' share price to a one-year low of £20.96. Chief executive Roger Whiteside said that while the company had no plans for immediate price rises, \"obviously that's going to have to remain under review given the way the markets are moving around the world on commodity food prices in particular\". The business swung back to a profit last year after taking a hit in 2020 when many of its shops were closed for much of the year due to the pandemic. Profit before tax rose to £145.6m for the year to 1 January, compared to a £13.7m loss in the previous 12 months. Full year sales rose by 5.3% compared with 2019, the year before the pandemic, to £1.2bn. Like-for-like sales, which strip out revenue from new shops open during the year, fell by 3.3% from pre-Covid levels. ",

            "content": "MPs have backed legislation to stop Vladimir Putin's allies from laundering money and hiding wealth in the UK. The Economic Crime Act became law in March after being rushed through Parliament. The UK is thought to be awash with Russian cash and other money looted from the former Soviet Union. That cash is buried in vast amounts of property - from office blocks to mega mansions - and the true owners are hidden in a web of secretive shell companies. These are organisations that only exist on paper and are registered in offshore tax havens. The Economic Crime Act is meant to help end that - having been promised since 2016. It was shelved earlier in 202, amid much criticism - including from the fraud minister, Lord Agnew, who quit. Now, the invasion of Ukraine has prompted a government U-turn. Only part of the original plan has made it into law because there's not enough Parliamentary time to deal with all proposals. The legislation: creates a register of overseas ownership of UK land and property - with punishments for withholding details\noverhauls Unexplained Wealth Orders\nmakes it easier to prosecute anyone involved in sanctions-busting If an individual owns a property, investigators and the public can find out who they are. The police will often seize property belonging to British drug bosses because it's easy to identify, and will have been bought with their criminal wealth. But discovering who owns property becomes more difficult if it is registered to an overseas company whose ultimate beneficiaries are hidden from view. And that means it's harder to uncover money stolen from abroad as it's laundered through the British property market. Let's take the case of the first successful Unexplained Wealth Order (UWO). That's a legal tool that allows the National Crime Agency (NCA) to go to court to seize a property if there's no apparent legitimate source of the wealth behind the purchase. UWOs are designed to take on incredibly rich people believed to have been associated with international corruption, organised criminals and their helpers. The first target was Zamira Hajiyeva, the wife of an Azerbaijan banker. Her husband was jailed for embezzling millions from the state - Mrs Hajiyeva herself denies wrongdoing. Woman who spent £16m in Harrods revealed\nHow to spend £16m in Harrods She was living in a £15m home near Harrods, where she spent millions over a decade. The Land Registry showed the owner wasn't her, but a mystery company in the British Virgin Islands (BVI), a tax haven. It was only with the help of BVI investigators that the NCA could legally link Mrs Hajiyeva to the home and force her to explain in court how she could afford it. When a lawyer typically registers ownership of land and property, they will have to declare in public records who ultimately benefits from it. That means corrupt politicians hiding wealth in British mansions, office blocks and luxury apartments, may at long last, become visible. The registry will apply to any property bought in the last 20 years, or since 2014 in Scotland. If the person registering the property fails to identify the beneficiary, the property will be, in effect, frozen - the owner won't be able lease it, sell it or raise a mortgage. Dirty money campaigners are delighted, but still have concerns. One fear is that it may be too difficult to prosecute lawyers or company agents who fail to reveal beneficiaries - because a court would have to be sure they had acted knowingly or recklessly. Another concern is that the package has too many loopholes to ensure that ultimate beneficial owners become known. For instance, if someone uses a front company, registered in Panama, to legally own property on their behalf - and there's no shareholder who owns more than a quarter of that company, then the register won't reveal their identity. \"For the sufficiently determined owner of a UK property who wants to remain anonymous, we think the Act leaves loopholes,\" says George Crozier, spokesman for the Chartered Institute of Taxation. Dr Susan Hawley of Spotlight on Corruption, an expert campaign group on dirty money, warns the law won't \"unpack the Russian doll'. Others predict that suspects - such as people who may be holding property for President Putin - could spirit wealth out of the country before the law is in force. The government abandoned its original proposal to give overseas entities 18 months to comply with the disclosure rules, by changing the deadline to six months. Labour had proposed 28 days - but that was defeated. \"I imagine that a lot of people in Kensington [one of London's most expensive areas] will be sticking property on Rightmove,\" says Helena Wood, a financial crime expert at the Rusi think tank. \"Practically speaking, these measures were never going to deal with [current] dodgy Russian assets. But they will mean it will be less likely that someone will want to hide money in the UK.\" UWOs, created in 2017, are trumpeted by ministers as an incredibly powerful weapon - but they have in fact only been used against four targets. That's because the NCA lost one of its test cases in 2020, which not only exposed flaws in the power, but left the taxpayer with a near £1m legal bill. When the Intelligence and Security Committee investigated Russia's role in the UK, Lynne Owens, the then head of the NCA, bluntly admitted that using UWOs to pursue the richest and most powerful targets carried huge financial risks. And so critics of the government say the agency hasn't the financial clout or legal powers to make UWOs workable. The Economic Crime Bill would permit investigators to target people who manage properties within complicated offshore arrangements, even if they're not the actual beneficiary. That will immediately widen the number of available targets. They'll also be given far more legal time to draw up a copper-bottomed case for court. But most importantly, the NCA will be protected against crippling legal costs, providing they acted reasonable and properly. Helena Wood at Rusi says the government could do more to financially protect the NCA across all its asset recovery powers - and failing to do so defeats the whole point of Parliament creating laws to investigate super-rich suspects. Dr Susan Hawley says the government must seize the opportunity. \"The NCA needs one big properly-funded anti-corruption unit - from looking at professional \"enablers\", like accountants and lawyers, through to people involved in busting sanctions,\" she says. \"Without a significant boost in resources none of these measures are going to work.\" ",

            "header": "Oligarch who said sanctions wouldn't help frozen out of firm",
            "content": "One of Russia's richest men who said imposing sanctions on oligarchs would have no impact on the war in Ukraine has been frozen out of a company. Investment firm LetterOne confirmed Mikhail Fridman's shareholdings had been \"frozen indefinitely\", along with those of long-time partner Pyotr Aven. Neither man can receive dividends or any other financial benefit. LetterOne said it was \"taking all action necessary\" to protect the 120,000 jobs its investments support. It added its board had decided to make a donation of $150m (£114m) to support people affected by the war in Ukraine. Mr Fridman and Mr Aven set up LetterOne, an international investment business based in Luxembourg, in 2013. The billionaire bankers both stepped down from the company last week after being sanctioned by the EU over Russia's invasion of Ukraine. Last week, Mr Fridman said the war was a tragedy for both sides, but stopped short of direct criticism, adding personal remarks could be a risk not just to himself but also staff and colleagues. Russian oligarch warns sanctions will not stop war\nWho is not on the UK sanctions list? Mr Fridman, who is the founder Russia's biggest investment bank, Alfa, said the sanctions, which freeze some assets and impose a travel ban, were unjustified and he would fight them. However, the oligarch, who has extensive interests in oil and retailing, added the sanctions would not have the desired effect of helping to rein in the Kremlin. Born in Ukraine before the break-up of the Soviet Union, Mr Fridman has been described by the European Union as an enabler of Putin's inner circle. The EU also says Pyotr Aven, who created Alfa-Bank with Mr Fridman, is one of President Vladimir Putin's closest oligarchs. Mervyn Davies, chairman of LetterOne, said everyone involved in the firm \"would want us to take these steps given their love and passion for and heritage in Ukraine\". Mr Davies, a former UK Labour government minister, is himself facing pressure to cut ties with LetterOne. The company said three other Russian board members, German Khan, Alexey Kuzmichev and Andrei Kosogov, had resigned from their positions as they believed it was \"the right thing to do\". Separately, Conservative peer Lord Barker has stepped down as chairman of EN+, the London-listed owner of Russian aluminium giant Rusal. Rusal was founded by Russian oligarch Oleg Deripaska, an industrialist with close ties to President Putin. Lord Barker, who quit after he faced pressure to cut ties following Russia's invasion of Ukraine, earned $4m (£3m) in 2020 from EN+ and $7.8m in 2019. Although he has resigned, the Sunday Times reported it is understood that he plans to take over large parts of the business in a restructuring aimed at distancing the company from Russia. In a statement, EN+ said it was considering \"carving out\" Rusal's international business. It has not announced if Lord Barker is part of its plans. Who is not on the UK sanctions list? Mr Deripaska is one of the richest men linked to President Putin - having made billions from his stake in Russia's aluminium industries, including EN+, which he owns 45% of. He first became widely known in the UK in 2008, when it emerged he had been involved in talks over a donation to the Conservative Party via George Osborne. The donation was never made but the story triggered a row at the time about links between British politicians and Russia's elites. He has been subject to US sanctions since 2018 but is not under any sanctions in the UK. In a tweet on Monday, Mr Deripaska said: \"We need peace as soon as possible, as we have already passed the point of no return. \"The entire world will be different, Russia will be different as well.\" Politicians with links to Russian oligarchs have been criticised since the start of the war in Ukraine, with the Institute of Directors (IoD) saying it is \"no longer tenable for British directors to be involved in governance roles in the Russian economy\". In a poll of its members, the IoD said 86% supported the view that all British people should now resign their Russian board mandates. Senior politicians also called on Lord Barker to sever ties to Mr Deripaska, rather than continuing to work for companies linked to the billionaire. Lord Barker was appointed as independent chairman of EN+ after the company was listed on stock markets in London and Moscow in 2017, before being appointed executive chairman in 2019. He was previously a member of the House of Commons from 2001 to 2015, before being made a life peer. He took a leave of absence from the House of Lords in 2019 after taking up his position with EN+. Elsewhere, Sandra Stash, an American non-executive director of Russian steel company Evraz stepped down from the firm, which is part-owned by Chelsea Football Club owner Roman Abramovich, who has a 29% stake in the company. Ms Stash became the second member of the company's board to step down, with James Rutherford, a British member of the board, quitting last week. Meanwhile, Ian Cockerill, the British chairman of the London and Moscow-listed precious metals mining company Polymetal, stepped down from the company's board, along with five other members - Ollie Oliveira, Tracey Kerr, Italia Boninelli, Victor Flores and Andrea Abt. Polymetal was founded in Saint Petersburg and operates a number of gold and silver mines in Russia, Kazakhstan and Armenia. ",

            "header": "Ukraine war 'catastrophic for global food'",
            "content": "The war in Ukraine will deliver a shock to the global supply and cost of food, the boss of one of the world's biggest fertiliser companies has said. Yara International, which operates in more than 60 countries, buys considerable amounts of essential raw materials from Russia. Fertiliser prices were already high due to soaring wholesale gas prices. Yara's boss, Svein Tore Holsether, has warned the situation could get even tougher. \"Things are changing by the hour,\" he told the BBC. \"We were already in a difficult situation before the war... and now it's additional disruption to the supply chains and we're getting close to the most important part of this season for the Northern hemisphere, where a lot of fertiliser needs to move on and that will quite likely be impacted.\" Russia and Ukraine are some of the biggest producers in agriculture and food globally. Russia also produces enormous amounts of nutrients, like potash and phosphate - key ingredients in fertilisers, which enable plants and crops to grow. \"Half the world's population gets food as a result of fertilisers... and if that's removed from the field for some crops, [the yield] will drop by 50%,\" Mr Holsether said. \"For me, it's not whether we are moving into a global food crisis - it's how large the crisis will be.\" His company has already been affected by the conflict after a missile hit Yara's office in Kyiv. The 11 staff were unharmed. The Norwegian-based company isn't directly affected by sanctions against Russia, but is having to deal with the fall-out. Trying to secure deliveries has become more difficult due to disruption in the shipping industry. Just hours after Mr Holsether spoke to the BBC, the Russian government urged its producers to halt fertiliser exports. He pointed out that about a quarter of the key nutrients used in European food production come from Russia. \"At the same time we're doing whatever we can do at the moment to also find additional sources. But with such short timelines it's limited,\" he said before the news emerged. Analysts have also warned that the move would mean higher costs for farmers and lower crop yields. That could feed through into even higher costs for food. Fears of UK food and fuel prices rising due to war\nFive ways the Ukraine war could push up prices\nEnergy shock: The economic reality of Putin's war Nutrients aren't the only factor to consider, either. Huge amounts of natural gas are needed to produce ammonia, the key ingredient in nitrogen fertiliser. Yara International relies on vast quantities of Russian gas for its European plants. Last year, it was forced to temporarily suspend production of about 40% of its capacity in Europe because of the spike in the price of wholesale gas. Other producers also cut supplies. Combined with higher shipping rates, sanctions on Belarus (another major potash supplier) and extreme weather - this prompted a big jump in fertiliser prices last year, adding to a surge in food prices. The company says it's making day-to-day evaluations on how to maintain supply and that it is too early to say if more shutdowns may be on the cards. It acknowledges it has a \"very strong obligation\" to keep production running at what it describes as a critical point. But Yara's boss says the world must, in the long-term, reduce its dependency on Russia for global food production. \"On the one hand, we're trying to keep fertiliser flowing to the farmers to keep up the agricultural yields. \"At the same time... there has to be a strong reaction. We condemn the Russian military invasion of Ukraine so this is a dilemma and one that frankly is very difficult.\" Climate change and growing populations had already been adding to the challenges the global food production system faces - all before the pandemic started. The Yara International chief executive describes the war as \"a catastrophe on top of a catastrophe\", highlighting just how vulnerable to shocks the global food supply chain now is. It will increase food insecurity in poorer countries, he adds. \"We have to keep in mind that in the last two years, there's been an increase of 100 million more people that go to bed hungry... so for this to come on top of it is really worrying.\" LIVE: Latest updates from on the ground\nIN KYIV: Locals fear another Grozny or Aleppo\nANALYSIS: Europe finally steps up\nEXPLAINED: Why Putin has invaded Ukraine?\nIN DEPTH: Full coverage of the conflict ",

            "header": "Ashneer Grover: Bitter BharatPe feud worries India's booming start-ups",
            "content": "The resignation of a high-profile Indian entrepreneur from the company he co-founded has led to worry in the country's booming start-up sector. Ashneer Grover, founder of at least two unicorns - tech start-ups valued at over $1bn - resigned last week as managing director of BharatPe, one of India's most prominent fintech companies, after a public fallout with the board of the company he founded. Mr Grover's abrasive behaviour as a judge on Shark Tank India - the Indian version of the reality show where aspiring entrepreneurs pitch their ideas to a panel of investors - had made him a talking point since December. But in January, he came under intense media scrutiny after a leaked phone conversation led to allegations that he had abused a bank employee for failing to secure funds so he could invest in the public share sale of beauty start-up Nykaa. The other side of edtech giant Byju's dizzying rise\nKoo: India's Twitter alternative with global ambitions Since then, BharatPe's board has accused him of misappropriating funds and siphoning off company money to pay for a \"lavish lifestyle\" - charges Mr Grover has denied. In his scathing resignation letter, he accused the company's investors of making him the \"villain of the piece\". \"You treat us founders as slaves - pushing us to build multi-billion-dollar businesses and cutting us down at will,\" Mr Grover said in his letter. The BBC spoke to corporate experts, who said Mr Grover's case - where there are allegations of fraud - is an aberration in India's start-up ecosystem. But it's only the latest in a series of ugly public spats involving the country's start-up entrepreneurs and investors. A few years ago, realty search portal Housing.com's Rahul Yadav famously told his board that they weren't \"intellectually capable\" of sensible discussion. Since then, big start-ups such as Ola and Flipkart have seen founders battle investors for control. India's start-up ecosystem has become a high-stakes game - thanks to a gush of liquidity around the globe, start-ups in India raised a record $28bn last year, birthing 43 new unicorns and making overnight millionaires of several internet entrepreneurs. But the dizzying valuations and furious deal-making are causing tensions between founder-entrepreneurs, investors and boards. \"There will be friction, as more and more money is raised and the founders' stake goes down,\" says TV Mohandas Pai, chairman of venture fund Aarin Capital. But in most cases, he insists, founders and investors have their interests aligned. \"Sometimes they [founders] think that they can do what they want, despite retaining only a minority stake. That's all right when you are alone. But you need to change your practices when the roles reverse, as they increasingly are,\" says Mr Pai, whose fund is an early investor in ed-tech giant Byju's, India's most valuable start-up. Indian tea start-ups search for an exotic edge Nithin Kamath, founder and CEO of Zerodha, a brokerage firm that has not raised private equity yet, says it's natural for founders to start feeling \"short-changed\" when their stakes get too diluted - which he cautions against. \"They need to have more skin in the game. Single-digit shareholding, where most start-up founders eventually end up at, is like being an employee, in terms of being able to run the business,\" Mr Kamath says. This may not always be possible - investors, chasing handsome returns, also often replace founders when companies reach a certain scale, to \"get people of their choice on board\", says Mitu Samar Jha, a reputation consultant who advises a number of entrepreneurs. The controversy surrounding Mr Grover has also put the spotlight on the broader issues with India's \"start-up culture\" - critics say this includes compromised governance standards, a toxic work environment and the phenomenon of founder-entrepreneurs assuming an increasingly boisterous public persona. \"This brashness, especially among entrepreneurs who've successfully raised money, comes from a belief that they have 'arrived',\" says Ms Jha. \"But little do they realise that they are growing on someone else's money, and that someone will question them.\" At least three top PR consultants told the BBC on condition of anonymity that they have had to terminate client relationships with major unicorns recently because of behavioural problems. \"Their demands are often unreasonable, and they don't value our advice,\" said one executive. Another complained of abusive behaviour and an inability to take \"no\" for an answer. \"A company's culture filters down to people at all levels. People down the ladder start exhibiting the same aggressive personality of the leader at the helm,\" he added. Experts say many aspects of business culture have been compromised because of the availability of an abundance of capital, and a push to grow at any cost. \"Valuations have taken precedence over values,\" says Shriram Subramanian, who heads an independent corporate governance research and advisory firm. He believes ethics, business processes and culture are all deemed secondary to hyper-growth, and this attitude is often encouraged by private equity players. \"Even if they don't actively encourage it, they don't condemn such behaviour.\" Over time, as capital dries out and the frenzy is tempered, attitudes will change, believes Mr Subramanian. Other experts also point to the fact that start-up culture everywhere around the globe is inherently driven by young people who have to adjust to shorter grooming times and quicker learning curves than traditional corporations. They also bypass governance rules applicable to listed companies, such as the need to have independent directors. \"These mechanisms must be brought in after the companies have found their product market fit,\" says K Ganesh, a serial entrepreneur and angel investor who founded one of India's largest online grocers, Bigbasket. Some believe accountability will improve as more start-ups raise public funds through the stock markets - though the process may be painful. \"You can't change gears suddenly,\" says Mr Kamath. \"The skill sets required to run a privately held company are different from those required to run a large public company. It is like playing Twenty20 vs a Test cricket match.\" ",

            "header": "Charities warn fuel poverty could double in a year",
            "content": "The number of fuel poor households in the UK will double in a year if the crisis in Ukraine leads to higher energy bills, charities are warning. Analysts are predicting that the war has pushed up wholesale prices, and could mean the average domestic bill in the UK hits £3,000 in October. National Energy Action said that would put 8.5 million households in serious financial difficulty from fuel bills. That would be twice the number of a year earlier, equating to 30% of homes. Charity Age UK said such an increase would have a \"devastating\" impact on the health and wellbeing of older people, many of whom could go without heating for weeks. The cost of gas and electricity for the typical household, on a tariff governed by the energy regulator Ofgem's price cap in England, Wales and Scotland, is already rising by 54% to nearly £2,000 from the start of April. Prices are also rising sharply in Northern Ireland. A string of energy analysts have predicted that the conflict in Ukraine, and the knock-on for gas supplied by Russia, could have a relatively sustained impact on the wholesale price of energy. UK suppliers, and ultimately consumers, are not immune to those global price rises, even though Russia only provides about 5% of the UK's gas supplies. Analysts have suggested that could be reflected in the next calculation of Ofgem's price cap, which would take effect at the start of October. Many, including the suppliers' own trade body, say the average household bill could get close to, or reach £3,000 a year. National Energy Action, which campaigns for warm, dry homes, said the number of households in fuel poverty was already expected to go up from four million in October 2021, to 6.5 million after April's price rise. That would go up again to 8.5 million in October this year, if the typical bill increases to £3,000. That is a possibility but still far from certain, owing to the volatility of the war, the international picture, and wholesale prices. The charity's definition of fuel poverty is a household which needs to spend more than 10% of their household income on fuel to heat their home to a satisfactory standard. Similar definitions are used officially in parts of the UK, although in England the definition of fuel poverty used by the government is a more complex calculation. When George Mycock, moved to London from Stoke-on-Trent, he ended up having to pay £950 a month for a room in a four-bedroom flat share. With bills included, it works out at about 70% of his monthly income. His flatmates have already seen bills go up by between £50 and £100 each in the last few months. But he says the rise in energy bills is \"scary\". \"We don't know how much we're going to have to pay [on our default tariff],\" he says. \"It's plunged people into uncertainty.\" Read more: How you are coping with rising prices National Energy Action has joined with 50 charity and campaign groups to call for support from the government for financially-stretched bill-payers. The coalition has claimed that further price rises could lead to more people dying prematurely across the UK next winter. \"This is a disaster and, inevitably, will lead to more needless winter deaths. The government must act now, to protect the most vulnerable, and to save lives,\" said Adam Scorer, chief executive of National Energy Action. Bill shock as energy price rises hit home\nWhat help with bills is there in my council tax band? A government spokeswoman said: \"It is hard to predict what longer term impacts the current situation in Ukraine will have on energy costs. However, the energy price cap will continue to insulate millions of customers from volatile global gas prices \"We are also taking decisive action to help more than 27 million households with rising energy costs, with a £200 reduction on bills this autumn and a £150 non-repayable reduction in council tax bills.\" ",

The cost of gas in Europe and the UK has hit record levels as fears persist that Russian supplies could be reduced. Higher costs for aluminium and copper also means UK shoppers are likely to face further price rises, the head of the London Metal Exchange has said. Economists have warned inflation, which tracks the cost of living, may hit 10%. Wholesale markets are where UK energy suppliers buy their gas to sell on to consumers. On Friday, wholesale gas prices for delivery to UK supplier jumped to 508p per therm. If prices remain high for long periods it will push up household bills, adding to cost of living pressures. Over the past few days, gas prices have been extremely volatile, but the trend has been upwards. On Thursday, an industry body warned that UK household energy bills could reach as high as £3,000 a year. In addition, the recent surge in the cost of metals is also likely to push up the prices of some goods. Copper prices are at five-year highs, and other commodities have jumped in price since the Ukraine conflict began. Matthew Chamberlain, who leads the London Metal Exchange, told the BBC's Today programme that prices for canned goods and copper wiring may rise. \"We've seen aluminium and nickel up 30% since the beginning of the year, and that will ultimately be passed on to consumers when you buy your drinks can made of aluminium, or when you make renovations to your house and you need copper for your wiring, all of those prices do go into the overall inflationary pressure.\" Why are prices rising so quickly?\nFive ways the Ukraine war could push up prices Panmure Gordon economist Simon French told the BBC that the UK's inflation rate could now hit 10%. Sarah Hewin, a senior economist at Standard Chartered Bank, agreed, warning that with rising gas prices feeding into higher energy bills, and increasing petrol and food prices, it was \"entirely feasible\" that inflation could move beyond the 7.5% rate that the Bank of England has predicted for April. \"Russia and Ukraine are important grain producers so we're likely to food prices rising here in the UK as well,\" she said. \"Overall, food, energy and transport account for around 25% of consumer prices. It's possible, if the crisis continues in the coming weeks, and even months, that inflation could move up to double digits in the UK\". UK petrol prices have hit another record, with the average price of a litre of petrol reaching £1.53 a litre, while diesel reached £1.57 a litre. This week, the price of Brent crude - the global oil benchmark - surged to more than $119 a barrel at one point, the highest since May 2012. On Friday, it was trading at around $114 a barrel. Stock markets across Europe tumbled on Friday following sharp falls in Asia after a fire broke out at the Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant in Ukraine, the largest in Europe. London's FTSE 100 closed 3.5% down while France's CAC-40 index dropped 5% and Germany's Dax also fell 4.4%. Reflecting the sharp rise in commodity prices, Anglo-Russian gold producer Polymetal saw its share price in London jump by more than 25%. Evraz, the Russian steel-maker which counts oligarch Roman Abramovich as a major shareholder, also saw its share price jump by 23%. The fire at the Ukraine nuclear power plant happened after Russia troops shelled the site. Some investor concerns were eased after officials said the plant's safety was \"secured\". The International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) later said that it had spoken to Ukraine's leadership and had been told important equipment at the plant was still working. The shelling has drawn international condemnation, with the US President Joe Biden joining Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky in urging Russia to cease the shelling and allow firefighters to access the site. In recent days, Russia's invasion of Ukraine has sent shockwaves through the global financial and energy markets, as investors try to understand the implications of sanctions and supply chain disruptions. The price of gold, which is regarded as a safer asset in times of uncertainty, has increased by 7.3% in a month to $1,938 per ounce. The Russian rouble has hit a record low against the US dollar as countries around the world impose tough sanctions on the country. Meanwhile, more British executives are bowing to pressure to quit Russian companies. James Rutherford on Thursday became the latest UK national to step down from a Russian company's board, resigning from the Roman Abramovich-backed steel firm Evraz. It came after the business group the Institute of Directors called on Britons to resign from the boards of Russian companies, due to the invasion of Ukraine.

            "content": "Fitbit has recalled one of its fitness-tracking smartwatches due to the risk of it overheating and burning people. The company, now owned by Google, said it had issued a voluntary recall of the Fitbit Ionic watch. It will give people who purchased the device a refund of $299 (£225) and a discount on a replacement product. The Fitbit Ionic was manufactured between 2017 and 2020, and about 1.7 million of them were sold internationally. None of its other fitness trackers are affected by the recall. Fitbit had received more than 170 reports of the lithium battery in its Ionic watch overheating, according to the US Consumer Product Safety Commission (CPSC). The CPSC said it was aware of 78 reports of burn injuries in the US, including two reports of third-degree burns from an over-heating battery. A third-degree burn is a severe burn that destroys the skin and may damage underlying tissue. It often requires a skin graft. The CPSC said it was aware of 40 burn injuries internationally. In a statement, Fitbit said: \"Customer safety is always Fitbit's top priority and out of an abundance of caution, we are voluntarily recalling Fitbit Ionic smartwatches.\" It said the number of reports about the watches overheating represented \"less than 0.01% of units sold\". Owners of a Fitbit Ionic can read more information on the Fitbit website. ",

Second class stamps will also increase by 2p to 68p, with the new prices coming into effect on 4 April. Royal Mail said it was having to deliver to a growing number of addresses, which was adding to costs. Letter volumes have fallen by more than 60% since their peak in 2004-05 and by about 20% since the pandemic began. Postmen and women deliver about seven billion letters in total each year, said Nick Landon, chief commercial officer at Royal Mail, but the number of addresses they have to deliver to has grown by around 3.5 million since 2004, when letter volumes were at about 20 billion a year on average. \"We need to carefully balance our pricing against declining letter volumes and increasing costs of delivering to a growing number of addresses six days a week,\" he said. \"As customer needs change and we see a greater shift from letters to parcels, it is vital that the universal service adapts to stay relevant and sustainable.\" The increase in stamp prices comes as many households are being hit by rises in the cost of living, with energy bills, fuel prices and food costs all going up. Mr Landon said Royal Mail understood that businesses and households were \"finding it hard in the current economic environment\", and said the company would \"always keep our prices as affordable as possible\". Coronavirus lockdowns led to a sharp reduction in letter volumes, and Royal Mail lost £180m in revenue in the first half of 2020. In November 2020, the company said revenue from parcel deliveries had surpassed letters for the first time, fuelled by a surge in online shopping during the pandemic. ",

            "content": "French authorities have seized a super yacht owned by an oligarch as part of the sanctions against Russia. A yacht owned by Igor Sechin, boss of Russian state energy company Rosneft, was grabbed by French customs officers near Marseille. However, German authorities denied a report that they had seized a $600m vessel owned by Russian metal tycoon Alisher Usmanov in Hamburg. On Thursday, Mr Usmanov was one of two more Russians sanctioned by the UK. The BBC understands that some oligarchs sanctioned by the European Union are \"shocked\" to find their debit cards no longer function, and they are now relying on using cash from safes. The French acted quickly on Wednesday when customs officers noticed that Mr Sechin's 88-metre \"Amore Vero\" - which translates as \"true love\" - was \"taking steps to sail off urgently\". UK must target Putin's Mayfair lifestyle, says Labour It arrived in in the Mediterranean port of La Ciotat in January and had been due to stay there while being repaired until 1 April. It has also been reported that yachts belonging to five other Russian billionaires were heading to the Maldives, regarded as a safe home because it does not have an extradition treaty with the US. The move by France came as the Prime Minister's official spokesman rejected claims that the UK has been slower at introducing sanctions than the EU or that legal hold-ups are preventing sanctions on Russian oligarchs. He reiterated the UK's position that it was better to prioritise the measures that had the biggest economic impact, rather than targeting individuals just because they were well known. Some oligarchs have been sanctioned by the government, which means their UK bank accounts are frozen and access to funds denied. But others are taking advantage of any delay in adding them to its list. A lawyer told the BBC that wealthy Russians were looking to move their money out of the UK before being hit by sanctions. \"The government has softened the blow by giving [wealthy Russians] time to move their money out,\" lawyer Nigel Kushner of W Legal told the BBC. Speaking to the Today programme, he said: \"Clients have been asking: 'Can I move my money out before I'm on the list?' I will say yes, that's perfectly legitimate.\" The government's list of Russians sanctioned includes 195 individuals, but most predate the invasion of Ukraine. Since the start of the war just 15 Russians have been added to the sanctions list, including President Vladimir Putin. Security Minister Damian Hinds told the BBC that the wealth of Russian oligarchs with British investments would not prevent the UK Government from \"going after\" them. \"There will be more individuals (who) can be sanctioned,\" he told BBC Breakfast. \"We will be going after people as needed.\" Foreign Secretary Liz Truss said legal threats would not prevent the UK government sanctioning Russian oligarchs. In an interview in Lithuania, she said: \"We have to make sure we have the right evidence to put in place those sanctions. \"We will continue to work through our list, we will continue to sanction oligarchs and there is nowhere for any of Putin's cronies to hide.\" Energy bills could reach £3,000 as oil price soars\nGrowing numbers of firms pull back from Russia\nWhat sanctions could West still impose on Russia? Meanwhile, the London Stock Exchange (LSE) has suspended the shares of 28 Russian-linked companies because of sanctions introduced following the invasion of Ukraine. They include green energy and metals company En+ Group run by US-sanctioned oligarch Oleg Deripaska, which is chaired by Conservative peer and former energy minister Greg Barker. The decision to suspend the listings \"has been based on sanctions and the ability to run an orderly market,\" said LSE chief executive David Schwimmer. \"If we see any other securities affected by sanctions then similar actions will take place.\" Last week, a subsidiary of Russia's second largest bank, VTB, was suspended on the LSE as a result of sanctions. However, a number of Russian companies, including Roman Abramovich-backed Evraz, continue to trade on the stock market despite criticism from politicians. New economic sanctions have also been announced to stop Russian aviation and space companies getting access to the UK insurance market. The move will limit the benefits Russian businesses can receive from their access to the global insurance and reinsurance market through Lloyd's, the world's biggest insurance market.

            "content": "Ukraine's government has said it will issue non-fungible tokens (NFTs) to fund its military as they defend the country against the Russian invasion. The announcement by deputy prime minister Mykhailo Fedorov comes in the same week the country raised more than £200m from the sale of war bonds. The bonds are one of a number of ways Ukraine is using to raise funds. The government is also in talks with the International Monetary Fund (IMF) and World Bank over emergency help. In a Tweet, Mr Fedorov said the NFTs will be launched \"soon\". However, there were no plans to sell fungible tokens, of which cryptocurrencies are a prime example, he added. NFTs are \"one-of-a-kind\" assets in the digital world that can be bought and sold like any other piece of property, but which have no tangible form of their own. The digital tokens can be thought of as certificates of ownership for virtual or physical assets. The announcement is the latest sign that the Ukrainian government is embracing digital assets as it looks for new ways to raise money to pay for its military. The BBC is not responsible for the content of external sites.\nView original tweet on Twitter On Tuesday, Ukraine raised 8.1bn hryvnia (£202m; $270m) from an auction of war bonds. Each one-year bond has a nominal value of 1,000 Ukrainian hryvnia and offered an 11% interest rate. The country's ministry of finance said: \"The proceeds from the bonds will be used to meet the needs of the Armed Forces of Ukraine.\" Also this week, the World Bank and IMF said they are working on a multi-billion package for Ukraine in the coming months. Meanwhile, millions of dollars have been given to the Ukrainian war effort through anonymous Bitcoin donations, according to cryptocurrency analysts. On Saturday, the official Twitter account of the Ukraine government posted a message: \"Stand with the people of Ukraine. Now accepting cryptocurrency donations. Bitcoin, Ethereum and USDT.\" It posted addresses for two cryptocurrency wallets which collected $5.4m (£4m) in Bitcoin, Ether and other coins within eight hours. ",

            "content": "UK energy bills could reach as high as £3,000 a year as oil and gas prices surge amid the Ukraine conflict, the energy industry has said. Russia's invasion of Ukraine has made the trading, banking and shipping sectors reluctant to buy Russian commodities, pushing up prices. The price of Brent crude oil rose above $119 a barrel to the highest since May 2012, while gas prices rose as well. Average UK petrol prices have also hit a new record. The RAC said petrol reached £1.52 a litre for the first time, while diesel rose to a high of 155.79p. Russian oil and gas exports are exempted from Western sanctions for now, but the prospect of further action by the US and the EU is stifling Russian trade. Emma Pinchbeck, the chief executive of the energy industry body Energy UK, said: \"It's a really worrying time for both customers and industry. \"We've been saying since the autumn that we'd expect bills to go up again in October. With what we're seeing in Ukraine and in the oil and gas markets, we're now expecting those to go up further.\" She said that if oil prices remain at elevated levels \"you can expect bills to be anywhere between £2,500 and £3,000 in October depending on the tariffs people have and what happens in the market\". The prices that people pay for energy and fuel depend on wholesale markets, which can go down as well as up. But average UK household energy bills are already set to rise to around £2,000 in April when the price cap is increased. Will Russia's invasion push up gas bills?\nEnergy bills set to soar but millions may get £200 help Gas prices had hit record highs last year due to colder winters which put pressure on supplies and reduced the amount of reserves countries had stored up. Ms Pinchbeck said: \"We have been saying for a long time this is an enduring crisis on the gas price and now that's being exacerbated by what's happening in Ukraine.\" The RAC also warned that high fuel prices could be here to stay. RAC spokesman Simon Williams, said: \"What drivers pay at the pumps in the UK is determined by the cost of oil and the exchange rate as fuel, like oil, is traded in dollars.\" He said with oil prices rising and the value of the pound at $1.33 \"further price rises are inevitable in the coming days and weeks\". Brent crude rose as a high as $119.84 a barrel at one point on Thursday, before sliding back to about $112. Meanwhile, European stock markets slipped as the Russian invasion continued. The UK's FTSE 100 share index closed down 2.5%, while the main markets in France and Germany ended down 1.8% and 2.1% respectively. Energy companies are sending emails to customers right now warning of price rises to hit in April - but these are a frozen picture. Bills are massively increasing as the price cap is going up by more than 50% and it is starting to feel real now, as people are now being told how much their individual direct debits will increase by. But those increases don't take account of what is currently taking place in Ukraine. The price cap is been raised every six month which means there is a half-year lag in protecting customers from immediate fluctuations on the global gas and oil markets. There was such huge pressure on the government to step in and act ahead of April's increase that they announced a package of extra help for households this time. It's not until the next price cap rise in October that we will feel the impact of the gas and oil spikes going on right now. The government will be under more pressure to help customers, and while for many households another energy price rise is unthinkable, there also seems to be a growing acceptance among consumers that the 'Putin Penalty' is one we will all have to shoulder to some extent. A government spokesperson said: \"It is hard to predict what longer term impacts the current situation in Ukraine will have on energy costs. \"However, the energy price cap will continue to insulate millions of customers from volatile global gas prices.\" Neil Wilson, chief market analyst at Markets.com, said oil traders were acting as though Russian energy exports had already been sanctioned, and were looking for other sources of oil. \"Self-sanctions are already playing a big role,\" he said. \"Shell, BP, Chevron are all exiting but traders and customers are swerving Russian oil without any sanctions needed.\" \"European gas prices hit a record this morning. Coal prices are through the roof too,\" he said, adding there was \"nowhere to hide for European consumers about to get hit by a mega electricity bill and soaring inflation.\" Energy prices are pushing up the cost of living in the UK. The UK rate of inflation - which shows the cost of living - rose at a 30-year high of 5.5% in January and is expected to rise above 7% once the new energy price cap is introduced in the spring. Russia is the second biggest exporter of crude oil, and is also the world's largest natural gas exporter. Oil cartel Opec decided not to increase production further than already planned at a meeting on Wednesday, despite US calls to pump more oil. Ukraine and Russia are also two of the world's largest wheat producers, and account for nearly a third of global exports. Exports from the Black Sea have nearly halted amid the invasion of Ukraine and sanctions. Wheat prices jumped earlier in the week, but fell back on Thursday.

            "content": "Entain, the gaming giant which owns Ladbrokes, is to repay £44m of the furlough money it claimed during the pandemic, but keep £57.5m. Carolyn Harris MP called it \"absolutely shameful\" that Entain was not repaying it all, despite soaring profits. The group made £393m in pre-tax profit in 2021, up 125% on the year before. It said the furlough scheme had helped to protect 14,000 jobs, and a “more certain medium-term outlook” made the partial repayment possible. Entain has around 3,000 betting shops in the UK branded Ladbrokes or Coral – which it had to close for large parts of 2020 and 2021 because of coronavirus restrictions. However, punters did not stop betting, they simply moved online. Entain’s online business grew rapidly, and helping to push the group’s revenues up 8% last year. In response to a BBC News story in January, MPs called on Entain to repay the money it had received under the furlough scheme, with former Conservative leader Sir Iain Duncan Smith saying the company should \"immediately hand the money back to the UK taxpayer\". Entain has said previously that the situation was “under review”. On Thursday, it announced that it would return the £44m it claimed in 2021, but keep the £57.5m it claimed in 2020. Labour MP Carolyn Harris, chair of the Gambling Related Harm All Party Parliamentary Group, said; \"Given that this company made hundreds of millions of pounds in profit last year directly from gamblers who lost money, it is absolutely shameful that they have also taken from taxpayers, and that they have not repaid the full furlough amount.\" Entain said in a statement: “The scheme was a sensible and highly welcome policy intervention that helped us, as one of the country's largest retailers, to maintain the livelihoods of more than 14,000 retail colleagues on full pay. \"We have kept the situation under review since we first made use of the scheme and are pleased to be in a position to repay these monies.” One of Entain’s rivals, William Hill, also had to close its betting shops, but it returned the £24.5m furlough it claimed in 2020, and took no more, citing the \"strength of the post-lockdown recovery\". Bookmakers Betfred claimed at least £46.6m from the furlough during the pandemic, despite making £205m profit in their latest accounts. The BBC has asked Betfred for a comment in response to Entain's move. In January, a spokesperson for the firm said: \"Thanks to the government’s Job Retention [furlough] Scheme we have not had to make a single redundancy due to the pandemic and we will continue to invest in our shops on the High Street.” ",

            "header": "Gas bills: Will Russia's invasion push up prices?",
            "content": "High energy prices are already causing problems for households in the UK and across Europe, and Russia's invasion of Ukraine is set to make the situation worse. So where does the UK get its gas from and how much could bills rise? EU countries get about 40% of their gas directly from Russia. The UK gets less than 5% of its gas from Russia but its gas prices are affected by fluctuations in the global markets. While Russian oil and gas exports aren't directly affected by Western sanctions, the prospect of further action by the US and EU is hitting Russian trade and pushing up gas prices globally. The sanctions already imposed by Western nations are designed to stop Russia's banks from doing business in several major economies and trade areas. Separately Germany has blocked the progress of Russia's Nord Stream 2 gas pipeline. Experts fear that Putin may decide to retaliate by reducing gas supplies to Europe. If this were to happen wholesale costs - (ie the cost suppliers face when buying to supply their customers) - would rocket and send prices higher everywhere, including the UK. Household energy costs have been kept in check by the price cap, but average household bills are expected to rise by about £700 to about £2,000 in April when the price cap is increased, and rise again in the autumn when the price cap is again revised. Energy bills could reach £3,000 as oil price soars The energy regulator Ofgem agreed to increase the cap after dozens of energy firms collapsed because they could not pass on the increased wholesale costs to their customers. As a result, more than four million customers have been switched to a different supplier in the last year, often on a higher tariff. Rising energy prices have already contributed to a big surge in the UK's cost of living, with inflation at 5.5% in the 12 months to January, the highest rate since March 1992. Four cheap ways to save energy at home this winter\nWhat can I do if my energy supplier goes bust?\nHow to save energy at home and help the planet About half of the UK's gas comes directly from the North Sea. The UK has been a big producer of gas since the mid-1960s, but the amount produced has fallen since 2000 while demand continues to rise. Another third of the UK's gas comes through pipelines from Norway. The rest come mainly as liquefied natural gas (LNG) imports in tankers from Qatar, the US and others. The small amount of Russian gas the UK buys also comes in LNG form. LNG supplies are particularly sensitive to global market prices, and are sold to whoever pays the most. The government says the UK's energy bill crisis is due to high global gas prices, not security of supply. However, that could change quite rapidly if Russian gas becomes scarce, as countries that depend heavily on Russian gas will have to compete for alternative supplies. The UK also has limited storage facilities, which means it is more affected by short-term price fluctuations in the wholesale gas market than countries which can hold greater reserves. The government says it is \"not complacent\" about gas supplies. It does have the power to impose emergency measures, such as ordering big industrial customers to temporarily stop using gas. Even before Russia's invasion of Ukraine, the market was in crisis. Colder winters in 2021 put pressure on supplies and depleted gas reserves. Those reserves would normally have been replenished in summer months but output dropped as some producers used this time to for maintenance postponed during Covid lockdowns. Meanwhile, calm weather reduced the amount of electricity generated by wind power. As a result, wholesale gas prices more than quadrupled last year. The UK has been especially badly-hit as it is one of Europe's biggest users of natural gas - 85% of homes use gas central heating, while gas also generates a third of the UK's electricity. ",

            "header": "Former Nissan executive convicted over Carlos Ghosn pay case",
            "content": "A former Nissan executive Greg Kelly has been found guilty of assisting the Japanese car giant's ex-CEO Carlos Ghosn to evade pay disclosure laws. The court in Tokyo heard that Mr Kelly had helped Mr Ghosn hide part of 9.3 billion yen (£60m; $80.4m) of his income from financial regulators. Mr Kelly was sentenced to six months in jail, suspended for three years. In 2019, Mr Ghosn fled Japan to his home country Lebanon hidden in a box on a private jet. The ruling means that Mr Kelly, who is a US citizen, will not be jailed as long as he adheres to the conditions of his sentence for the next three years. Prosecutors had sought a two-year prison sentence for Mr Kelly. Under Japanese law both sides could appeal the verdict. 'My husband has become collateral damage'\nThe downfall of Nissan's Carlos Ghosn: An insider's view Mr Kelly's sentencing brings to an end the first, and potentially only, trial over the charges that saw Mr Ghosn's arrest in 2018. The court also fined Nissan 200 million yen for failing to disclose Mr Ghosn's pay. The carmaker pleaded guilty at the start of the trial 18 months ago. This verdict will be a relief, not just for Greg Kelly and his family, but for the US government and the Japanese government too. The Kelly case has been a thorn in the side of US-Japan relations for the last three years. You can see that from the response of US Ambassador to Japan, Rahm Emanuel, who immediately released a statement welcoming the fact that Mr Kelly and his wife will now be able to return to the United States. The verdict itself is only a partial victory for the Tokyo prosecutors. In the end Mr Kelly was convicted of just one count of misreporting financial information, for one year, 2018. The judges rejected the prosecutors' case that Mr Kelly was involved in a much larger conspiracy to hide around $80m of remuneration to former Nissan CEO Carlos Ghosn, going all the way back to 2010. The cases against Mr Kelly and Carlos Ghosn have been hugely controversial and have shone an unwelcome light on Japan's judicial system, in particular its system of detaining and interrogating suspects for long periods without charge and without an attorney present. Before Mr Ghosn's escape from Japan he was expected to be a co-defendant alongside Mr Kelly. Mr Ghosn was first arrested on charges of financial misconduct, for allegedly under-reporting his pay package for the five years to 2015. He has told the BBC about his dramatic escape, that involved disguising himself to slip unnoticed through the streets of Tokyo, being hidden in a large music equipment box and fleeing to his native Lebanon. In 2021, an American father and son were handed jail terms in Japan for helping to smuggle Mr Ghosn out of the country on a private jet. US Special Forces veteran Michael Taylor was sentenced to two years in prison, while his son Peter was handed a term of one year and eight months. ",

            "header": "The bosses helping staff pay their soaring energy bills",
            "content": "When managing director, Ilona Hitel, heard that UK household energy bills were about to soar higher, she decided to help her staff. \"I knew some of the team were anxious about the costs ahead, and inflation, and so I said 'you don't need to worry',\" explains Ms Hitel, the boss of London-based public relations firm CommsCo. With energy bills due to jump by an average 54% or £693 a year from April, Ms Hitel is giving each of her 12-strong team a permanent £700 annual pay rise. The money will be in addition to their usual annual increase. \"We've got a responsibility to look after our staff,\" she says. \"It's about how we treat our people in the hard times, and they were so pleased. It was a good reaction, they appreciated it.\" Energy prices are set to jump from April because the energy price cap - the maximum price suppliers in England, Wales and Scotland can charge households - is being raised, in response to much higher wholesale prices. Yet, with inflation rising to 5.5% in January, (its highest level for 30 years), it is not just energy prices that are increasing strongly. The cost of food has also soared. And Russia's invasion of Ukraine has led to much higher petrol and diesel prices. Given these cost of living pressures, Ms Hitel isn't the only boss who is stepping in to support their staff financially during these troubling times. Chris Stringer, chief executive of Birmingham-based That Recruitment Company, sent an email to his 24 employees this month, letting them know that they would be receiving a 5% pay rise - because he didn't want to to see them struggling. \"The price rises have been on my mind for a while, although the decision to give a pay rise wasn't very thought through,\" he admits. \"I just thought that I'm in a position to that do that, and, you know, 30k (£30,000) now, is not the same as it was three years ago. \"The energy increase is concerning. Everybody is struggling now. I don't think you should work just to pay the bills. Life is hard. Anyway, it's only 14 staff not like 250,000.\" The recruitment consultancy boss jokes that the reaction of his staff \"wasn't as good as the response on (social media platform) LinkedIn\", where one of his employee's posted about the increase, and has received about 40,000 likes so far. \"It's not a life-changing sum for our staff, but they're pleased I've recognised the cost of living, and given them extra security,\" he adds. Stephen Clayton is another boss who has given his staff a permanent pay rise to cover the cost of their rising energy bills. The chief executive of energy consulting firm RSL Renewables says he didn't want staff to be be worrying about how to heat and light their homes. \"Some of my staff are young, some mothers with children, one whose monthly energy bill had gone from like £100 to £300,\" says Mr Clayton. His firm is based in South Shields, Tyne and Wear. \"I want people to leave the stresses at the door. But you can't do that when you have a massive bill to pay, you're not going to perform.\" He describes next month's energy price hike as \"disgusting\", adding: \"Normal people will be choosing between eating and heating, and that shouldn't be the case.\" Mr Clayton says his team of 12 were \"over the moon\" when he told them the news in one-to-one meetings. At Glasgow-based tech firm Firefish Software, employee David Connolly and his colleagues have been given a pay rise of £600 per employee to help cover the increased cost of living. Mr Connolly, 31, says it was a \"lovely gesture\". \"It was a really nice surprise, I was shocked but delighted. Rising prices have been a concern of mine over the last few weeks. \"I've noticed prices increase at the petrol pump and then food shopping. The energy bills increase hasn't happened yet for us, but I keep on hearing horror stories so it had been a concern. It's good that employers are helping employees who are struggling and need support.\" New Economy is a new series exploring how businesses, trade, economies and working life are changing fast. When it comes to giving employees the extra income to cover the increase in their energy bills companies need to consider tax. \"If the idea is to give the employee an extra £600 in their pockets, it could be arranged for this to be paid net via payroll,\" says Clare Bowen, director at accountants MHA Monahans. Ms Bowen explains this is where the employer would cover the tax and national insurance due by increasing the gross amount paid, but cautions this could represent a significant sum for someone on a higher rate tax band. \"For example, if an employer wanted to give an extra £100 into an employee's pay packet, £125 would have to be given for tax deducted to still amount to £100. However, for any employee who earns more, within the 40% tax bracket, employers would have to give £170. Not only must caution be exercised, but employers must consider if this is fair.\" She also adds that employers could alternatively look at giving the additional money as a one-off extra payment rather than an increase to general salary, and note that it is a discretionary gift to ensure it doesn't get swept up in annual pay increases and become part of the normal pay. \"Employers would also need to consider where it was an amount subject to pension contributions,\" adds Ms Bowen. Of course, contributing to employee's energy bills can pay dividends in other ways. \"It makes employees feel valued and appreciated,\" says Melanie Folkes-Mayers, managing director at human relations firm Eden Mayers HR Consulting. \"What you don't want is team members leaving for that additional cost. \"An extra £50 a month isn't a huge amount to keep the team happy and help heat their homes and feel comfortable.\" ",

            "content": "The boss of one of the world's biggest crypto-currency exchanges has ruled out restricting ordinary Russians from using the service. Binance founder and chief executive Changpeng Zhao, told BBC Radio 4's Today programme: \"Many normal Russians do not agree with war.\" Major cryptocurrency exchanges have been asked by Ukraine to block Russian users. One financial expert warned the war could become a \"crypto conflict\". In a tweet sent on Sunday Ukraine's Deputy Prime Minster Mykhailo Fedorov asked major crypto-currency exchanges to block the addresses of ordinary Russian users, not just politicians. The BBC is not responsible for the content of external sites.\nView original tweet on Twitter The value of Bitcoin has risen 13% since the Russian invasion of Ukraine, according to the Reuters news agency. There has been speculation Russian oligarchs may pour their money into cryptocurrencies to avoid sanctions and other restrictions. And the Telegraph newspaper called cryptocurrency \"Putin's sanctions-busting super-weapon\". But Mr Zhao said: \"We're not against any people. \"We differentiate between the Russian politicians who start wars and the normal people. \"Many normal Russians do not agree with war.\" \"We don't control the industry. \"I can publish my sanction list, you can publish yours... Guess what? No-one else is going to follow. \"It just moves Russian users to other smaller platforms,\" he said. In a statement published earlier, Binance said it would not unilaterally freeze millions of \"innocent users'\" accounts. \"Crypto is meant to provide greater financial freedom for people across the globe,\" the company told BBC News. Any unilateral ban would \"fly in the face\" of the reason crypto existed. But \"while minimising the impact to innocent users\", it was taking the steps necessary to enforce sanctions. Mr Zhao said: \"There are, I think, a few hundred individuals that are on the international sanction list in Russia - those are mostly politicians, et cetera. \"We follow that very, very strictly. \"And we are not in a position to sanction populations of people. \"We are not political - we are against war but we are here to help the people.\" Several other cryptocurrency exchanges have also ruled out freezing all Russian accounts, according to a Vice News investigation. Kraken's chief executive Jesse Powell, for example, said its platform would not freeze Russian accounts, which would go against Bitcoin's \"libertarian values\". The BBC is not responsible for the content of external sites.\nView original tweet on Twitter But Tom Keatinge, director of the Centre for Financial Crime and Security Studies (CFCS), at the Royal United Services Institute (RUSI) think tank, warned exchanges that failed to follow the rules might find themselves cut off from financial services. \"Those banks that provide services to crypto exchanges will be watching their clients' activities very carefully to ensure that they are diligently applying the checks required by the expanding sanctions regimes against Russia,\" he said. The war in Ukraine could become the first meaningful \"crypto conflict\", Mr Keatinge told BBC News, as those seeking to \"evade sanctions, protect their savings or avoid a collapsing banking system turn to cryptocurrencies for solutions\". Criminals laundered $8.6bn (£6.4bn) of crypto-currency in 2021, up 30% on the previous year, according to a report by blockchain data company Chainalysis published prior to the invasion. And the Financial Times revealed: \"Trading between the Russian rouble and crypto assets such as Bitcoin and Tether had doubled since the assault on Ukraine began, reaching $60m a day.\" The increase comes as governments have sought to cut Russia out of the financial system. On Wednesday, French Finance Minister Bruno le Maire said that the European Union will include crypto currencies in its sanctions against Russia, aimed at making Moscow's aggression against Ukraine as costly as possible. He told journalists during a news conference that the sanctions against Russia were very effective and have \"disorganised\" the Russian financial system. The British government has alsoannounced measures to crack down on money laundering by Russian \"oligarchs and kleptocrats\", including new powers to seize crypto assets. Chainalysis's Caroline Malcolm told BBC News: \"As with the traditional financial system, Russian oligarchs could leverage crypto-currency to evade the sanctions.\" But it was unlikely designated persons under sanctions would move around large quantities of cryptocurrency now. \"Russia's elite and financial authorities have been preparing for sanctions for some time,\" she said. \"To the extent that cryptocurrency may be used to evade sanctions related to this crisis, it likely would have happened slowly over the past several months.\" And analytics tools used for following money were more effective than those \"capable of disrupting Russia's use of a network of traditional bank wires or physical cash to evade sanctions\". Tom Robinson, of blockchain analysis company Elliptic, said crypto-currency could be an attractive haven for the wealth of oligarchs as it could not be seized and no-one could prevent it being moved. But it was \"highly traceable, which means that they would find it difficult to spend anywhere that sanctions are enforced\". ",

            "content": "The cost of a typical UK home rose by a record £29,162 in the last year, according to the Nationwide. The building society said it was the biggest cash increase in property prices since it started collecting comparable data in 1991. It pushed up the price of an average UK home to £260,230 in February, it said. Property values are being driven by continued demand from buyers who are competing for relatively few properties on the market. The Nationwide, one of the UK's larger mortgage lenders, said that its data suggested UK house prices had risen by 12.6% in the year to the end of February. That was an acceleration from the 11.2% annual increase recorded in January. Significant house price rises are continuing despite a squeeze on household finances caused by the rising cost of domestic energy, petrol and other necessities such as food. \"The continued buoyancy of the housing market is a little surprising, given the mounting pressure on household budgets from rising inflation, which reached a 30-year high of 5.5% in January, and since borrowing costs have started to move up from all-time lows in recent months,\" said Robert Gardner, Nationwide's chief economist. He said the economic outlook was uncertain, although it was likely that the housing market would slow. First-time buyers rise: 'I couldn't keep paying rent'\nRental costs jump as workers return to the office Many people reconsidered how they lived and worked during the Covid lockdowns, leading to a race for space among buyers. In recent months, there has been a considerable shortage of homes on the market to match demand, which has pushed up asking prices. The Nationwide said the price of a typical home was 20% higher than the same month two years ago, just before the start of the pandemic - the equivalent of a £44,000 increase. Karen Noye, a mortgage expert at wealth managers Quilter, said: \"For first-time buyers these increases represent a game of cat and mouse where prospective buyers just manage to save enough for a deposit before the cost of their first home is just out of reach again.\" Myron Jobson, senior personal finance analyst at Interactive Investor, said: \"The harsh reality is rising rents, ballooning inflation which continues to outstrip wage growth, and a lack of affordable housing has priced many out of the market.\" ",

Airbus said on Wednesday: \"In line with international sanctions now in place, Airbus has suspended support services to Russian airlines, as well as the supply of spare part to the country. \"Services provided by the Airbus Engineering Centre in Russia (ECAR) have also been suspended pending further review.\" US aviation giant Boeing said it had suspended \"major operations\" in Moscow and temporarily closed its office in Ukraine's capital Kyiv. \"We are also suspending parts, maintenance and technical support services for Russian airlines,\" a Boeing spokesperson told the BBC. ExxonMobil is the latest oil producer to cut business ties with the country, after similar moves by BP, Shell and Equinor. \"We deplore Russia's military action that violates the territorial integrity of Ukraine and endangers its people,\" Texas-based ExxonMobil said in a statement. \"We are deeply saddened by the loss of innocent lives and support the strong international response,\" it added. ExxonMobil currently operates and holds a stake in the Sakhalin Island oil and gas fields, alongside Rosneft and companies from Japan and India. It said it would now exit its Russian oil and gas operations, which have been valued at more than $4bn (£3bn), and halt new investments in the country.

            "content": "UK ports are \"working at pace\" to block Russian ships after the UK passed a law banning them from entering port, a trade body has said. The UK was the first country to make such a move due to Russia's invasion of Ukraine, and the EU is considering a ban. Russian ships are diverting, are at anchor, or are being packed up, the UK Major Ports Group said. However, the ban is unlikely to add to pressure on fuel prices, the RAC said. UK Transport Secretary Grant Shapps announced on Tuesday that the UK had become the first country to pass a law banning ships with \"any Russian connection\" from entering its ports. On Wednesday, Tim Morris, chief executive of trade association the UK Major Ports Group, told BBC Radio 4's Today programme that some Russian-linked vessels had already been denied access to UK ports, while others were diverting their routes. He said: \"Right now what we're seeing is some vessels related to Russian interests divert on the way to the UK. Some are at anchor off the coast of the UK, having been denied access to our ports, and are working out what they do next. \"And the vessels that were here already have been packed up and dispatched as quickly as safety allows. So we are all working at pace, alongside the government, to play our role against the very troubling situation that we see in Ukraine.\" He said working out which vessels were Russian-flagged was relatively straightforward, but it was more difficult for ports to work out which were owned and operated by firms with Russian interests. Ports have been working with government so they \"have the best sight that we can\" of which vessels are of interest, he said. Mr Morris said Russian trade made up only about 2% to 3% of total traffic that moves through UK ports. But there are some particular concentrations in trade in commodities like oil, liquefied natural gas and some agricultural products. He said: \"It's unlikely to be a supply problem but it certainly feeds in as part of the broader debates… about energy products.\" Apple to halt sales and limit services in Russia\nUkraine conflict: ExxonMobil and Boeing take action over Russia ties Russia is one of the major suppliers of oil to the UK. In 2021, Russia was the third largest country that the UK sourced its oil from, with 13% of imports for the year. The UK is by no means reliant on Russia for crude oil. In 2021, the UK got only 6% of its crude oil imports from Russia. But the UK buys a lot of its diesel from Russia. In 2020, Russia was the largest source country for UK diesel. Together, Russia, the Netherlands, and Saudi Arabia accounted for 62% of total road diesel imports. Petrol and diesel prices in the UK have been hitting record highs as the price of crude oil has risen due to the Russian invasion of Ukraine, which came on top of increased demand as countries recover from the coronavirus pandemic. However, RAC fuel spokesman Simon Williams said that the ban on Russian ships was unlikely to add to pressure on fuel prices, as Russian diesel could be shipped in as cargo by firms from other countries. He added that there is diversity of supply. \"It depends what the ships are flagged under,\" he said. \"We also deal with other countries.\" THE STORY OF MIWSIG: Eleri Price and Huw Stephens time travel with Welsh language pop\nMARGINS TO MAINSTREAM: Michael Sheen introduces new writers revealing their truths ",

            "header": "Ukraine conflict: Oil hits $113 a barrel despite emergency measures",
            "content": "Oil prices have surged despite new measures aimed at calming markets worried by the invasion of Ukraine. Brent crude - the international benchmark for oil prices - has hit $113 a barrel, marking the highest level since June 2014. It rose even after the International Energy Agency's members agreed to release 60 million barrels of oil from emergency stockpiles. Russia is one of the biggest energy producers in the world. As a result, concerns about Russia's invasion of Ukraine have sparked concerns among investors that oil or gas supplies could be affected. Meanwhile, the price of US oil - West Texas Intermediate crude - rose to almost $109 a barrel. What sanctions are being imposed on Russia?\nMajor movie studios halt Russia film releases\nUkraine to sell 'war bonds' to fund armed forces\nJaguar Land Rover pauses car sales to Russia The United States and 30 other member countries of the International Energy Agency (IEA) agreed to release the oil in a bid to stabilize energy markets worldwide. \"We are prepared to use every tool available to us to limit disruption to global energy supply as a result of President Vladimir Putin's actions,\" White House spokeswoman Jen Psaki said on Tuesday. She added that Washington would carry on looking at how to speed up moving energy supplies away from Russia. Another statement by the IEA noted that the invasion of Ukraine came against a \"backdrop of already tight global oil markets, heightened price volatility, commercial inventories that are at their lowest level since 2014\". Petrol price movements in the UK are mainly determined by the price of crude oil, which is the raw material for fuel, and the exchange rate between the dollar and the pound, because oil is traded in dollars. On Monday, the RAC said the average price of petrol had jumped to a record high of £1.51 a litre on Sunday, while diesel increased to £1.55. Jay Hatfield, chief investment officer at ICAP, said the \"dramatic\" price increases seen globally were unlikely to persist though if the situation in Ukraine becomes more stable. Share prices across Europe and the US also fell further on Tuesday as attacks on cities in Ukraine continued. Markets in US, Europe and UK fell amid fears about the impact of the ongoing conflict. Having been up in early trading, the FTSE 100 turned negative amid the warnings of the consequences of Western sanctions on Moscow and signs that Russia was stepping up its invasion of Ukraine. Western countries have imposed punishing sanctions against Moscow, with another raft of companies winding down Russian operations and halting investment, such as BP and Shell. Italian energy giant Eni also said it planned to sell its stake in the Blue Stream pipeline. Eni co-owns the pipeline, which carries Russian gas to Turkey, with Russian energy firm Gazprom. Meanwhile, French oil and gas group TotalEnergies said it would no longer provide capital for new projects in Russia on Tuesday. Frankfurt saw steeper losses, which analysts suggested could be linked to Germany's reliance on Russian energy imports. Russia's currency was stable, however, having collapsed 30% on Monday to record lows against major currencies. One rouble was worth less than one US cent in trading on Tuesday. The rouble's fall cuts its buying power and hits savings of ordinary Russians. The decline was only halted when Russia's central bank doubled interest rates to make the currency more attractive to investors. The sanctions' stranglehold on Moscow's finances has hit the central bank's access to a lot of Russia's huge reserves of money held in the form of foreign currencies. Sophie Lund-Yates, equity analyst at Hargreaves Lansdown, said: \"This is a fast-moving situation and investors should be mindful of potential share price volatility in the short to medium term.\" Russia's invasion of Ukraine has investors on edge. There is a huge amount of uncertainty about what is likely to happen next, and you can see that in the volatility on markets. Western sanctions on Russia have caused turmoil in the global banking sector, with firms scrambling to ensure they're not doing business with any sanctioned individual or company. European and US asset managers who are keen to offload their Russian investments may find it difficult to do so with the Moscow stock exchange currently closed and talk that the Kremlin will prevent foreigners from selling up. That - together with the lack of revenue from Russian customers - could mean lower profits for western companies, from energy giants to carmakers to investment funds. Sanctions can hurt both sides, not just the sanctioned. But many company bosses are clear - decisions are being made, not simply about money, but on moral grounds too. Meanwhile, the war continues to unsettle the energy markets, with the price of oil now well over $100 a barrel. An announcement that large stockpiles of crude will be released would ordinarily send prices lower. Today's news, however, has done nothing to ease market concerns about the potential for shortages of oil from Russia.

            "content": "Prices in shops rose at their fastest rate in over a decade in February, the British Retail Consortium (BRC) says. Shop price inflation jumped from 1.5% in January to 1.8% in February, according to the BRC-NielsenIQ price index. It marks the highest rate of inflation it has recorded since November 2011. The sharp rise was partly driven by fresh food price rises and higher prices for other goods such as beauty and furniture products. Many people have been struggling with a cost of living crisis as fuel prices and energy bills continue to soar. The latest official figures provided by the Office for National Statistics (ONS) showed living costs rising at their highest rate for 30 years. Why are prices rising so quickly?\nUK wage growth lags rising cost of living\nWhat help with bills is there in my council tax band? Non-food inflation rose to 1.3% in February, rising from 0.9% in January which is its highest rate since September 2011, the BRC said on Wednesday. The inflation rate for fresh food, which measures how quickly costs for everyday items increase over time, rose to 3.3% - up from 2.9% in January, according to the industry group. The BRC said this was partly because of poor harvests, both in the UK and overseas. Helen Dickinson, chief executive of the BRC, said that the price rises would be \"unwelcome news\" for households who already face taking how less because of energy price rises and higher National Insurance rates. Retailers, Ms Dickinson added, are still facing cost pressures from higher shipping rates, labour shortages, product price increases and rising energy prices. Many of these increases continue to be passed on to customers. \"Retailers are going to great lengths to mitigate against these price rises and support their customers, for example, many supermarkets have expanded their value ranges for food,\" Ms Dickinson continued. \"Unfortunately, there are limits to the costs that retailers can absorb,\" she added. Mike Watkins, head of retailer and business insight at research firm NielsenIQ, said he expects shop prices to continue to rise over the next few months. \"With falling disposable income for most households, retailers will need to keep encouraging customers to spend by offering choice and value and, for some, discounts as well as added benefits for loyal shoppers,\" Mr Watkins added. The Bank of England has warned the increase in the cost of living could exceed more than 7% this year. Food chains such as Greggs, have already raised the price of some goods in order to cover increased labour costs. The High Street retailer Next, has also said its prices could rise by up to 6% this year to keep up with higher costs. Supermarket giant Tesco has also warned that the \"worst is yet to come\" for rising food prices. Jack Monroe, a food poverty campaigner, has said that the prices of everyday essentials are going up by more than the official inflation rate, hitting the poorest hardest. The ONS agreed that \"one inflation rate doesn't fit all\" and said it would soon be publishing a wider variety of cost-of-living metrics. ",

Sony has also halted the release of its Marvel adaptation Morbius in the country. \"Given the ongoing military action in Ukraine and the resulting uncertainty and humanitarian crisis unfolding in that region, we will be pausing our planned theatrical releases in Russia,\" a spokesperson told the BBC.

Tech platforms Twitter and Facebook have also moved to limit the presence of Russian state-backed news outlet information on their platforms as these have been accused of spreading misinformation about the Russian invasion of Ukraine. Meta, which owns Facebook, said it would restrict access in the European Union to state-owned media outlets RT and Sputnik. Twitter also said it would add warnings to tweets that share links to Russian state-affiliated media. Twitter's head of site integrity, Yoel Roth, said the platform has seen more than 45,000 tweets per day that were sharing links to these media outlets. Google said it would block YouTube channels connected to Russian broadcasters RT and Sputnick across Europe. The moves come as many companies try to distance themselves from Russia. Among the actions taken are: Oil giants Shell and BP have said they will sell their Russian interests\nFrench oil firm TotalEnergies will not finance new Russian projects\nVisa and Mastercard have blocked multiple Russian financial institutions from their networks\nPayments cards issues by sanctioned Russian banks do not work on Google Pay or Apple Pay\nCanada is banning imports of Russian crude oil\nCarmaker Jaguar Land Rover is pausing deliveries to Russia due to \"trading challenges\"\nTransport giants Maersk and MSC temporarily suspend container shipping to and from Russia, except food, medical and humanitarian goods\nShipping giant MSC\nHarley-Davidson has suspended its Russian business and all shipments to the country Big investors have also started to either ditch Russian investments or put new investments on hold. The UK's biggest private pension fund, the British Universities Superannuation Scheme (USS), said on Tuesday that it was \"looking to sell\" its Russian assets. \"We think there's a clear financial as well as a moral case for divestment with respect to our Russian holdings,\" USS chief executive Simon Pilcher told the BBC's Today programme. \"There's very little appetite for anyone to trade with Russia under these circumstances, and therefore, in that context, it's very hard to see how Russian investments are a sound financial investment.\" Mr Pilcher also said the moral case \"was fairly compelling that one should have nothing to do with Russia in the current environment\". Lucy Coutts, investment director at JM Finn, said: \"Russia is un-investable at the present time. The Russian economy has been absolutely slammed by a broadside of crushing Western sanctions. \"Its economy is seizing up, the rouble is worth less than one US cent, inflation is soaring, mortgage rates have gone from 7.5% to 18.6% overnight, and the Russian people are being forced to pay.\" Credit rating agencies have said the likelihood of defaults on Russian debt has gone up, so bond markets have seized up, she added.

            "content": "Sainsbury's is set to close 200 of its in-store cafes next month, putting about 2,000 jobs at risk. The supermarket has also announced plans to close less popular hot food counters in 34 stores. Chief executive Simon Roberts said the chain was \"absolutely committed\" to supporting the members of staff affected. They will be prioritised for vacant jobs and encouraged to look at alternative roles within the business. It comes as part of new plans aimed at updating the supermarket's eat-in, takeaway and home delivery food and drink offer for customers. The move follows a trial of a new \"food hall\" format called The Restaurant Hub at its Selly Oak store in Birmingham. Sainsbury's raises pay to £10 an hour\nChampagne sales give Sainsbury's bumper Christmas\n'UK first' in Tesco's carbon reduction push Off the back of the trial, Sainsbury's plans to open 30 more of the food halls in 2022, as well as 30 Starbucks coffee shops in its supermarkets over the next 12 months. It is currently working in partnership with the Boparan Restaurant Group on the project. As part of the trial, customers were able to choose options from the likes of Gourmet Burger Kitchen, Ed's Diner and Slim Chickens. Sainsbury's said it could increase the number of food halls in future years, if they continued to perform well with customers. The remaining 67 cafes will remain open while Sainsbury's reviews roll-out plans. In a statement, the supermarket said it had spoken to all of its cafe workers today about the closure plans. It also said that it would \"simplify the way it runs its bakeries\" in 54 stores and hold talks with those workers and those on the hot food counters, with the aim of redeploying them in other departments in-store if possible. The retailer has already closed its fresh fish, cheese and meat counters in stores, which saw about 3,500 jobs cut. Mr Roberts said: \"We are totally focused on improving what we can deliver for our customers and at the same time, working hard to make our business simpler. \"We are really excited about this new customer offer we will be rolling out over the next two to three years across many of our stores.\" He added, however, that he acknowledged this was an \"uncertain\" time for many members of staff. \"Of course, we understand this is very unsettling for our colleagues, but we must keep adapting our business to make sure we are offering customers the best possible food and drink at affordable prices,\" he said. Susannah Streeter, senior investment analyst at Hargreaves Lansdown, said the announcement marked the latest in a raft of restructuring moves as the supermarket seeks to keep a lid on rising costs - and compete with the likes of discounters Aldi and Lidl. \"The chain is clearly hoping customers will 'taste the difference' via these tie-ups... while its own staff costs are taken out of the equation and it can concentrate spend on the business of filling trollies and virtual baskets instead,\" she said. Sainsbury's is the first of the \"big four\" supermarkets to restructure its cafes. It's all part of a wider plan to simplify the business and save money. Caffè Carluccio's is going to be the main offer and it will work alongside one or two other brands using the same kitchen, which will fulfil orders for home deliveries and takeaways too. Sixty-seven Sainsbury's cafes remain, for now. They provide hot food like a cooked breakfast and are still popular with shoppers. So bringing in these new, popular, brands is an eye-catching move. Other new partners could also be brought in. Will shoppers will miss the old cafes? The new ones won't be as cheap. But in-store cafes are hard work to run. Sainsbury's is prioritising its food offer in the aisles and trying to stay as competitive as possible on price. But Unite the union hit out at Sainsbury's, demanding compulsory redundancies for cafe workers should be ruled out. Unite national officer for food, drink and agriculture, Bev Clarkson, said: \"Our members showed great loyalty to Sainsbury's during the pandemic. They served their communities during lockdown and ensured Sainsbury's flourished when other businesses flatlined. \"Now Sainsbury's must repay them by keeping job losses to an absolute minimum and ruling out compulsory redundancies,\" she said. Richard Lim, the chief executive of Retail Economics added that the pandemic had brought about huge changes for the food industry. \"Disruptive technologies have created near frictionless access to groceries, takeaway and food on-demand, resulting in greater competition and the merging of channels,\" he said. He added that takeaways could be a \"lucrative opportunity\" for supermarkets which have enough stores to supply large numbers of people with lots of different cuisines. \"The takeaway market has seen impressive growth in recent years as digital platforms provide greater choice, faster deliveries and more competition. So there's no surprise that the supermarkets are trying to establish a firm foothold in the market and cater for evolving consumer habits.\" ",

            "header": "Ukraine conflict: Russia doubles interest rate after rouble slumps",
            "content": "Russia has more than doubled its interest rate to 20% in a bid to halt a slump in the value of its currency. The Bank of Russia raised the rate from 9.5% after the rouble sank 30% after new Western sanctions. The currency then eased back to about 20% down. The collapse in value erodes the currency's buying power and could wipe out the savings of ordinary Russians. Amid pictures at the weekend of queues at cash machines, Russia said it had the resources to ride out sanctions. President Vladimir Putin on Monday responded to the sanctions with an order barring citizens from transferring money outside of Russia, including for debt payments. Moscow's stock market, which saw heavy losses last week as investors sold, is to be closed for a second day on Tuesday. Ahead of an emergency meeting between President Vladimir Putin and his economic advisers on Monday, Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov said: \"These are heavy sanctions, they're problematic, but Russia has the necessary potential to compensate the damage from these sanctions.\" What is Swift and why is banning Russia so significant?\nWhat sanctions are being imposed on Russia? The UK, along with the US and EU, cut off major Russian banks from financial markets in the West, prohibiting dealings with the central bank, state-owned investment funds and the finance ministry. The moves sent the rouble tumbling. Chancellor Rishi Sunak said the measures demonstrated the UK's \"determination to apply severe economic sanctions in response to Russia's invasion of Ukraine\". Russia has about $630bn (£470bn) in reserves - a stockpile of savings - built up from soaring oil and gas prices. But because a lot of this money is stored in foreign currencies like the dollar, the euro and sterling as well as gold, the Western ban on dealing with Russia's central bank restricts Moscow from accessing the cash. Last week, Russia's central bank was forced to increase the amount of money it supplies to ATMs after demand for cash reached the highest level since March 2020. Videos on social media on Sunday appeared to show long queues forming at cash machines and money exchanges in Moscow, with people worried that their bank cards may stop working or that limits will be placed on the amount of cash they can withdraw. Chris Weafer, chief executive at consultancy firm Micro-Advisory and based in Moscow, said on Monday he was seeing some queues in food stores. \"You are beginning to see a little bit of queuing in some grocery stores, particularly people buying some goods that they think might come into short supply due to trade restrictions or maybe will be subject to big price increases because of the rouble devaluation. \"This set of sanctions is hitting ordinary Russians to an extent that previous sanctions have not and people are now becoming aware of that. \"People are a lot more fearful. There is already talk about some companies having to either go on reduced working hours, or even suspend production because they're not able to access maybe key parts from the West due to sanctions or due to trade limitations, so there's a great deal of concern on the street.\" Moscow resident Anastasia told Reuters that she expected her economic situation to get worse. \"It's inevitable in these circumstances,\" she added. Whilst another Moscow resident Sergey said he was already seeing an impact. \"Prices are rising, of course, savings are shrinking and stocks are falling.\" On Monday, the central bank said it had ordered brokers to suspend the execution of all orders by foreign legal entities and individuals to sell Russian investments. The sanctions that have been imposed by the EU, the US, the UK and others are unprecedented. It's one thing to block the foreign reserves of a country like Iran or Venezuela, quite another to act against Russia - a country with a major role in global trade and a very significant supplier of oil and gas. The reaction on the currency markets has been dramatic - with the rouble plummeting, despite the central bank's efforts to prop it up using interest rates. There may already have been a rush to the foreign currency ATMs in Russian cities, but citizens there have yet to feel the full impact. At the very least prices will rise dramatically; banking collapses, hyperinflation and a deep recession are all potential consequences. But sanctions are a two-way street. Cutting the central bank off from its reserves and limiting Russian institutions' access to the Swift network will not only hurt Russia - western institutions also face losses from debts that cannot or will not be repaid, for example. And then there is the risk of countermeasures from Russia - potentially hitting energy exports. Such sweeping sanctions being imposed in such a unified way is remarkable. It's also a very big gamble. Attempts to put a stranglehold around Russia's finances reverberated across the financial and corporate world: The price of crude oil jumped to $101 per barrel, and the dollar and gold rose as investors sought safer places to put their money.\nThe price of gas for delivery over the next couple of months soared by 24%.\nEuropean markets tumbled at the open amid fears over financial stability, but later pared losses with London's FTSE 100 closing down 0.4%. Paris fell 1.3% and Frankfurt 0.7%.\nBP's share price slumped more than 6% after it decided to exit Russian oil and gas operations at a cost of up to $25bn. Shell also said it would quit its Russian ventures.\nRussian gold producer Polymetal was the biggest faller on the FTSE 100, down 56%, while shares in Evraz - the steel firm controlled by Roman Abramovich and Alexander Abramov - sank 29%.\nUS markets were mixed, with the Dow closing down 0.5%, the S&P 500 off 0.2%, while the Nasdaq gained 0.4%. The major exchanges temporarily halted trading of Russian stocks to understand the impact of the sanctions.\nUS bank Citigroup was among the biggest losers, falling more than 4.4% after the firm disclosed nearly $10bn in exposure to Russia, including more than $5bn in loans, securities and funding commitments\nEquinor, the energy firm majority owned by the Norway government, started to divest its joint ventures in Russia.\nWheat prices saw their biggest one-day gain in a decade on supply worries from Russia and Ukraine.\nSwitzerland also said it would follow the European Union's sanctions, breaking its tradition of neutrality. Will Walker-Arnott, senior investment manager at Charles Stanley, told the BBC's Today programme that \"it looks like Russia is increasingly becoming an economic pariah, increasingly isolated from the global financial system\". Cutting some Russian banks from international payments system Swift is among the harshest measure so far imposed to date on Moscow over the Ukraine conflict. The assets of Russia's central bank will also be frozen, limiting the country's ability to access its overseas reserves. Russia is heavily reliant on the Swift system for its key oil and gas exports. It was not clear whether those deals would be exempt from the bans. The intention is to \"further isolate Russia from the international financial system\", a joint statement said. On Monday, the European Central Bank (ECB) said several European subsidiaries of Sberbank Russia, which is Russia's largest bank and majority owned by the Russian government, were failing or likely to fail due to reputational cost of the war in Ukraine. Sberbank Europe AG, which had total assets of €13.64bn (£11.4bn) at the end of last year, along with its Croatian and Slovenian units, suffered a rapid deposit outflow in recent days and is likely to fail to pay its debts or other liabilities, said the ECB, which is the lenders' supervisor.

            "content": "Fuel prices have hit record highs in the UK as Russia's invasion of Ukraine continues to affect global oil prices. The RAC said the average price of petrol jumped to £1.51 a litre on Sunday, while diesel increased to £1.55. The price of both fuels has jumped since Thursday, when Russia began its assault on Ukraine. RAC fuel spokesman Simon Williams said despite oil prices calming, prices at the pump will continue to rise. The cost of filling a 55-litre family car with unleaded petrol is now £83, or £85 for diesel. \"This week will be an important one in terms of the oil price as it's likely to reveal the speed of the inevitable upward trend or the extent of the volatility in the market,\" said Mr Williams. Petrol prices: Are we paying too much at the pump? The price of Brent crude rose by 4.6% to $102 barrel on Monday after Western nations imposed new sanctions on Russia - one the world's largest energy producers. Petrol price movements in the UK are mainly determined by the price of crude oil, and the exchange rate between the dollar and the pound, because fuel, like oil is traded in dollars. Although the UK imports just 6% of its crude oil from Russia, it would still be affected by global wholesale prices rising. UK consumers are already paying a high price for fuel, with demand surging following the easing of Covid restrictions. Steve Irwin, from fuel consultancy firm Portland, told the BBC that prices had risen due to concerns over oil and gas pipelines which travel through Ukraine and carry Russian products. He said there was \"potential for enormous supply disruption\" if Russia retaliated to sanctions and used oil \"as a weapon\". \"It's impossible to know what kind of trajectory we are looking at for oil prices over the coming weeks,\" he said. However, Mr Irwin added that price was a bigger concern than supply currently, as the US and Saudi Arabia are also huge oil exporters. Mandy Watts depends on her car for work, but thinks \"the cost of petrol has gone through the roof\". Going carless isn't an option for Mandy, but she is trying to use it less. \"Being a single parent as well, you have to think about these things,\" she told the BBC. \"Is it petrol, is it food, is it heating, what do you put first? Food and heating has to come before petrol. So I tend to limit a little bit where I go now.\" Read more here Robert Halfon, a former Conservative minister, has called on Chancellor Rishi Sunak to look at reducing VAT or fuel duty, which has been frozen for 12 years. He told the Times: \"Given what is going on it is genuinely going to be unaffordable for most families. It isn't just for motorists, it's businesses too because they can't afford transportation costs and things like that.\" Luke Bosdet, fuel spokesman for the AA, said the rise in fuel costs came at the same time as households were facing energy bill rises. \"To think that, less than two years ago, fuel at £1 a litre beckoned,\" he said. \"If there is a silver lining, the predictions of 160p or even 170p-a-litre fuel now look exaggerated as the oil price fell back after one day's surge last week.\" ",

Temporary queues have been set up on faster payments - the digital system which is mostly used to transfer money to other individuals and businesses within a couple of hours. Nationwide said the problem was the result of a technical issue. Frustrated customers have faced similar problems in recent months. Relatively few people are paid their wages via faster payments. However, among those speaking out on social media was a customer who has not only been paid late for a third time, she is also trying to move house as the latest disruption has hit. A spokesman for Nationwide said staff were working hard to resolve the fault. \"Transactions are being temporarily queued while we get services back to normal and will be processed as soon as possible,\" he said. \"We apologise for any inconvenience caused.\" Other services, such as using debit cards, accessing balances via internet and mobile banking, and withdrawing cash from ATMs, are working as normal. The building society said anyone facing charges as a result of late payments should get in touch to discuss their situation. It said nobody would be left out of pocket as all \"associated Nationwide fees and charges will be refunded\". Customers have faced a series of payment issues, including at the turn of the year. They have come at a time when many people are financially stretched as a result of the rising cost of living. ",

            "header": "Cost of living: Bill shock as energy price rises hit home",
            "content": "Householders are discovering the stark reality of rising energy bills as emails from suppliers reveal how much more they will pay from April. Energy companies are required to send notices to their customers about an increase, stating in clear financial terms how much more they will pay. Some are being told of a projected rise in their annual bill of well over £1,000. Russia's invasion of Ukraine means a further bill shock in winter is likely. Will Russia's invasion of Ukraine push up gas bills? About 26 million households in England, Wales and Scotland are on variable energy tariffs or prepayment meters governed by regulator Ofgem's price cap. In April, a new cap means that a typical domestic energy bill will rise by about £700 a year, to around £2,000. However, the actual amount paid still depends on how much energy is used in the home and, to a much lesser extent, on where the customer lives. Regulations state that energy suppliers must notify their customers about price rises, and do so a \"reasonable\" amount of time in advance. The information should include the price increase, what it means for the customer financially, and when it takes effect. No marketing is allowed. Those messages are starting to be sent out now ahead of the increase in April, with millions of people set to receive them in the coming days. Individual projections show that those with relatively high amounts of energy use could be paying considerably more a year than they do now for gas and electricity. The shock is clear on social media. Among some strong language, one customers said: \"Serious choices on whether to heat my house or eat.\" Another said: \"God knows how people on lower incomes will afford these kind of hikes.\" Sunak defends response as energy bills soar by £693\nMost homes to get energy bill discount of £350 The bill shock is greater for those who were previously on much cheaper fixed deals with energy suppliers that have gone bust since the autumn. They were moved to variable deals with a new supplier. One said she had been paying about £1,000 a year before the crisis, and had now received a projected annual bill of £3,000. Frazer Scott, chief executive of Energy Action Scotland, said: \"It will always come as a surprise to many people because the scale of the increases are so big.\" There are currently no options available on the market to switch to a cheaper fixed tariff. Shell Energy is among the first to be sending out notices. \"We want to be transparent about this, because many families will be worried about what this will mean for their finances, particularly when the prices of so many other goods and services are also rising,\" said a spokesman for the supplier, which is also offering help to vulnerable customers via its website. About 70% of energy billpayers are charged via direct debit, with payments smoothed out across the year, so rising bills are not delayed until the winter. New, higher direct debit demands will feed through in the coming months. Prepayment meter customers will also see an immediate impact. This will coincide with extra financial burdens on households including higher National Insurance payments and rising prices in the shops. Citizens Advice said that it had seen more people visiting its help pages at the start of this year than at any other time during the pandemic, with particular interest in guides on help in paying energy bills. The government has promised a council tax rebate for those living in bands A to D, covering about 80% of households, of £150. Another £200 will be taken off energy bills from October, but households will pay that back in instalments from 2023. The invasion of Ukraine by Russia has already pushed up the wholesale price of energy, and that will eventually be felt by households. While the UK gets less than 5% of its gas from Russia, domestic gas prices are affected by fluctuations in the global markets. Among the predictions by analysts is a suggestion that the typical household energy bill could rise to £3,000 a year, when the next energy price cap takes effect in October. There remains a huge level of uncertainty about the conflict and these predictions, but there is a widespread expectation of a relatively large increase in bills in the winter. Even without the effect of the Ukraine crisis, bills were looking set to rise by another £400 a year. ",

            "content": "Fuel prices at UK pumps have hit all-time highs, and experts predict they will rise further due to the Ukraine crisis. The average price for a litre of petrol has been heading towards 150p and diesel prices are also at a record. At a toddler group in Woking, Surrey, children are happily playing with toy cars. But the cost of running real-life vehicles is an increasing worry for their parents and carers. Mandy Watts depends on her car for work, but thinks \"the cost of petrol has gone through the roof\". Going carless isn't an option for Mandy, but she is trying to use it less. \"Being a single parent as well, you have to think about these things. Is it petrol, is it food, is it heating, what do you put first? Food and heating has to come before petrol. So I tend to limit a little bit where I go now.\" Why Ukraine crisis could cause global price rises\nEnergy bills: 'It's really extraordinarily grim'\nPrices rising at their fastest rate for 30 years RAC fuel spokesman Simon Williams thinks high petrol prices are set to persist. \"Any uncertainty on the oil market will keep prices high. And unless the pound gets stronger, I think drivers could be paying above 150p for some considerable time\". Oil rose above $100 per barrel after Russia began its invasion of Ukraine, and this is expected to filter down to the price drivers pay at the pump. Back at the toddler group, Mariam Akhtar says she needs her car to get her two children to nursery and other activities, and for the supermarket shop. She has also noticed fuel prices going up. Her regular £40-50 top-up disappears within a week. \"It really does hit our budget. I'm trying to save up for a house as well. So you're trying to [budget around] your petrol, your life, your kids' lives. I think I spend more money on petrol than my kids' essential things.\" Businesses are feeling the pinch too. Mike Cherry, chair of the Federation of Small Businesses, says spiralling fuel prices are hurting companies just when tax hikes and fresh business rates bills loom large. He would like to see the government introduce measures in the Spring Statement which ease the cost of doing business, and make it easier to transition to low-emission vehicles. \"Close to half of small firms pointed to fuel as a main cause of rising costs last quarter, up from one in seven in the same period last year,\" he says. \"In remote areas, and especially in sectors where moving physical goods around is fundamental to business models, higher fuel prices will really be eroding bottom lines.\" Those challenges ring true for Kate Lester, founder and chief executive of courier network Diamond Logistics. Its vans, motorcycles and lorries transport a wide range of goods, from blood products to electric car chargers. As well as facing higher bills for filling up her firm's own vehicles, she says \"we've got pressures on pricing from our suppliers, the carriers who dispatch our overnight and international consignments\". \"Not only are they going up on an individual basis, we've got a variable fuel surcharge - and that can be as much as 25% at the moment.\" Diamond Logistics has done what it can to mitigate the impact, but it has put up its prices recently. \"That will be passed on our customers' customers too,\" Kate says. \"We're going to see a rise in the price of goods as a result\". It's not only couriers and haulage firms being stung by soaring prices at the pump. Lee Harrison runs Rowland Harrison Ltd, a ground maintenance firm in Manchester. He's worried about the prospect of fuel costs continuing to rise. \"Our biggest overhead after wages is diesel for the vans and petrol for the tools. It's having a big impact\". \"It's odd now that I'm filling one of these vans and the amount is over £100. I can't believe that, it's always been less than that in my lifetime.\" Turnover's the same, Lee says, \"but the profit margin's getting squeezed and squeezed\". \"We're going to have to look at things like, not change our fleet of vans for longer, make do and mend with the tools.\" He expects he'll have to start charging customers more. Lee also worries about the effect on his staff when he can't afford to put up wages further. \"If their bills are going up, in effect they're getting a pay cut.\" UK inflation has hit a 30-year high and the Bank of England has predicted it will reach 7% in the spring. Anna Leach, from the CBI business group, says consumers are in \"quite a vulnerable position\", with their spending power affected by the rise in the energy price cap. \"Businesses as well have already been suffering from the impact of electricity costs as well. So this really doubles down on a situation which was already very bad for consumers and businesses.\" She says rising prices could ultimately hit economic growth as people buy less as a result. Some businesses and sole traders are looking at ditching car use altogether, to avoid the financial hit. Wedding planner Poppy Brown normally travels across the UK to see venues, meet suppliers, and meet the couples she works with. \"Up until now, I have always driven as I find it's most convenient. However, now I'm looking at other means such as trains, as this actually may work out cheaper now. Otherwise it may even be a zoom call rather than an in-person visit.\" Despite the inconvenience, she is trying to look on the bright side. \"I do feel there are positive changes for the environment, and on the train I can actually get some work done.\" ",

            "header": "Stock markets rebound on Russia sanctions",
            "content": "Global markets soared on Friday as investor concerns eased about the severity of sanctions imposed on Russia following its invasion of Ukraine. Coordinated Western sanctions against Russia have targeted its banks but left its energy sector largely untouched. After sharp falls on Thursday, stock markets in the UK and Europe jumped more than 3%. US exchanges also rose. Oil prices reversed early gains on Friday and fell by more than 2% but are still trading near seven-year highs. Brent crude - the international benchmark for oil prices - dropped below $98 a barrel. The share price gains followed weeks of declines, fuelled in part by concerns about Europe's most severe conflict since World War Two. While the sanctions against Russia include freezing bank assets and cutting off state-owned enterprises, they stopped short of disconnecting Russia from the Swift international banking system or targeting its oil and gas exports, which some analysts said had helped stock markets start to recover. \"It's not that the market is saying the war is good news. They were worried about the war and selling off, and now it's happened and paradoxically it's not as bad as the worst case scenario, at least not yet,\" said Jonas Golterman, senior markets economist at Capital Economics. The UK's FTSE 100 index rose 3.9%- the biggest daily gain since November 2020 when Pfizer announced a vaccine breakthrough - and stock markets in Germany and France closed more than 3.5% higher. In the US, the Dow Jones Industrial Average closed 2.5% higher, while the S&P 500 rose 2.2% and the Nasdaq climbed 1.6%, extending gains from Thursday. Markets in Asia also closed higher. Why Ukraine crisis could cause global price rises\nWhat sanctions are being imposed on Russia? The gains came despite fighting across Ukraine on Friday forced tens of thousands of people from their homes. The US, UK and EU said Friday they would place sanctions on Russian President Vladimir Putin, but China's foreign ministry also reported that Mr Putin might be willing to hold talks with Ukraine. \"This is a very sentiment driven market right now, so if there is even a whisper that there might be willingness to talk, the market will rally and rally hard,\" said Ross Mayfield, a US-based investment strategy analyst at Baird investment bank. \"That's not based on fundamentals. That's pure sentiment.\" After the earlier global sell-off of shares, investors were also \"looking for bargains\", said Jane Foley, head of currency strategy at Rabobank. Ms Foley told the BBC's Today programme there were many firms in emerging markets which export agricultural products and raw materials such as metals, so \"perhaps they're going to be doing well in this crisis, because other countries will be looking to buy their commodities from other markets that aren't Russian\". The UK imports 6% of its crude oil and 5% of its gas from Russia, but there have been concerns that sanctions could constrict supplies and drive up prices worldwide. The high price of energy and fuel, with demand surging following the easing of Covid restrictions, is one of the main factors currently driving up the cost of living for people in the UK. Both the RAC and AA motoring groups said average fuel prices hit fresh record highs of 149.67p a litre for petrol, with diesel at 153.05p. Despite the fall on Friday, the AA predicted that petrol would hit 150p per litre over the weekend. There is a lag between crude oil and petrol price movements. Both motoring groups said the weak pound combined with crude oil prices would push up costs at the pump. RAC fuel spokesman Simon Williams said \"sadly, more increases are on the way\" due to the rise in the price of crude oil and the pound weakening against the dollar, \"making wholesale fuel more expensive to buy for retailers in the UK\". Gas prices have seen big fluctuations since Russia's military action began. UK wholesale gas prices soared nearly 60% on Thursday but on Friday prices were down more than 18%. LIVE: Latest updates from on the ground\nTHE BASICS: Why is Putin invading Ukraine?\nVISUAL GUIDE: Tracking the invasion in maps\nFROM KYIV: Sheltering from rockets in basements\nFROM MOSCOW: Shock and support in Russian capital Russia is the second largest exporter of crude oil after Saudi Arabia. It is also the world's biggest exporter of natural gas. Europe gets nearly a third of its oil and around 40% of its gas from Russia, much of it flowing through pipelines across Ukrainian territory. Concerns remain that sanctions could constrict supplies and drive up prices worldwide. Despite the inflation risk, analysts said the stock market rally reflects in part investor bets that uncertainty from the conflict will make central banks - in particular, the US Federal Reserve - move more cautiously to raise interest rates. Fear of aggressive action has been a major factor driving prices lower in recent weeks. \"With all of this uncertainty weighing, and part of that, the way high oil prices and high gas prices might weigh on consumer spending in the US, I think they'll be more hesitant,\" said Mr Mayfield of Baird.

            "content": "Russia's invasion of Ukraine could lead to prices rising at a rate not seen in decades, analysts suggest. Karen Ward, chief market strategist at JP Morgan Asset Management, said the economic fallout from the conflict could result in inflation reaching 8%. Global oil and gas prices have already surged following the invasion, pushing UK petrol prices to record highs. There are also fears food production costs could rise, with Russia being a large exporter of fertiliser. \"Russia and Ukraine are major exporters of not just oil and gas, but food,\" said Ms Ward, who was previously an advisor to former chancellor Philip Hammond. \"[They export] wheat, fertilisers, so that's going to impact the broad food chain and I think it's highly likely now in the UK we'll see inflation reach 8% which is a number we haven't seen in 30 years,\" she added. Why Ukraine crisis could cause global price rises\nEnergy shock: The economic reality of Putin's war Both Russia and Ukraine have at times been dubbed \"the breadbasket of Europe\", exporting about a quarter of the world's wheat and half of its sunflower products, such as seeds and oil. The war has led to analysts warning grain production could be hampered, causing global wheat prices to double, which could have knock-on effects across the world as supplies struggle to keep up with demand. The UK typically produces more than 90% of the wheat consumed in the country. However, farmers might find themselves paying more for the fertiliser used on crops. Those higher costs could therefore be passed onto customers through higher food prices. Pantheon Economics said the outlook for the UK economy had \"darkened\" following Russia's assault on Ukraine, as it also raised its inflation forecast to 8% in April, from a previous estimate of 7.7%. Its higher forecast was in response to oil prices over the past week, it said, as barrels hit their highest price for more than seven years, passing $100 (£74) following the invasion on Thursday. The RAC and AA motoring groups have said average petrol prices hit nearly 149.5p on Wednesday, with diesel at 152.83p. Analysts also warned of big price increases for natural gas, and suggested the UK energy regulator, Ofgem, would increase its energy price cap - which limits what suppliers can charge - by about 30% in October, above the 11% previously assumed. Russia is the world's largest natural gas exporter, and there are concerns Western sanctions could push President Vladimir Putin to constrict supplies to Europe. Such a move would drive up wholesale prices worldwide, including in the UK, which gets little of its gas from Russia directly. A bank, Investec, has warned household energy bills could top £3,000 a year in England, Wales and Scotland from October, in part due to the conflict. Regulator Ofgem's latest rise in the price cap comes into force in April, with the next adjustment due in October. The Bank of England has warned inflation could rise above 7% this year, but Ms Ward said it wasn't clear at this stage how the conflict in Ukraine might impact the Bank's decision around raising interest rates, which is a traditional response to cool inflation. \"The Bank of England will say 'If we raise interest rates, we're not going to bring down energy prices and in fact if we raise interest rates because the economy is already slowing because of the conflict, we could make matters worse\", Ms Ward said. \"However, the job becomes very difficult if higher inflation feeds higher wages and inflation gets embedded in the system. That's where they may have to react by raising interest rates into a slowdown. \"Stagflation - slowing growth, higher inflation - is certainly a risk in this environment. I think at the moment the Bank of England will prioritise supporting growth but certainly cost shocks, that is where we end up with slowing growth and rising inflation\", she added. Higher inflation rates have led Pantheon Economics analysts to forecast that real incomes will drop by the largest amount since World War Two. ",

            "content": "Department store chain John Lewis has said it will drop its \"Never Knowingly Undersold\" price pledge this summer. The price promise, which began in 1925, means the retailer matches prices on branded products with national retailers, but not online-only sales. John Lewis said the pledge was becoming less relevant as shopping moves increasingly online. Instead, the employee-owned retailer says it will spend £500m on keeping prices down. \"Never Knowingly Undersold has been a cherished sign of trust for John Lewis for a century but it doesn't fit with how customers shop today as more purchases are made online,\" said executive director Pippa Wicks. John Lewis says it expects shoppers to become more cost conscious as budgets are squeezed by the higher cost of living. Prices are currently rising faster than at any time in the past 30 years and wages are failing to keep up, meaning people's money is not going as far. The Bank of England expects the rate of inflation to pick up in April when a big rise in household energy bills takes effect. The John Lewis department store business is part of the John Lewis Partnership which also owns the Waitrose supermarket chain. The partnership is due to report full year results on 10 March after the pandemic drove it to a £517m loss in 2020-2021. But half-year results published in September showed a return to profit. John Lewis said it would give customers an exact date for when Never Knowingly Undersold ends nearer the time. ",

            "content": "The West's response to Russia's invasion of Ukraine is to squeeze it out of the global economy until Putin squeaks. Never in the field of economic conflict have so many weapons been deployed.\nThe main battlefront is over energy. Russia can punish its customers in the short term by cutting off gas supplies, but its European and British customers can punish Russia in the long term by finding alternative sources of energy.\nEconomic war brings business opportunities, which now extend to energy companies as much as suppliers of military equipment. This is war. And you are on one of the front lines. It's not just for Ukrainians, who face bombs and bullets. It's for everyone who faces the consequences of an economic war, with inflation a lethal weapon. \"The West's\" response to Russia's invasion of Ukraine is to do whatever it takes to isolate Russia and punish it. \"We will continue on a remorseless mission to squeeze Russia from the global economy,\" said Boris Johnson, announcing a barrage of bans on Russian finance, businesses, plutocrats, Aeroflot and denial of some western technology. The price of an iPhone in Moscow has reportedly soared. This may hurt Russians but it won't surprise them much, as they got there first. They've been fighting a hybrid war for years, including disinformation and destabilisation of political institutions. On the economy, Russia has dug in defences by reducing its dependence on the West for debt finance, and for technology. It has been trying to establish a parallel internet, with which to push the global one out, and it has resisted the spread of the big US-based tech companies. The reluctance to supply Europe with gas over this winter, with which to build up stocks after a wind-starved/gas-hungry summer, was one way of destabilising economies with soaring prices feeding through to inflation. Building the Nord Stream 2 gas pipeline drove a wedge between Washington and Berlin - until this week. Having shown it would use gas supplies to undermine and bully its close neighbours, at least Moscow gave Europe the opportunity of time to diversify gas supply, bringing it from Norway, North Africa and Liquified Natural Gas shipped from Qatar and the Gulf of Mexico. But being 40% dependent on Russian gas, that is one weapon of war that could be used by either side. If Russia chokes off that supply to Europe, it sends prices spiralling and instantly inflicts deep economic pain on European households and business. Britain doesn't buy much Russian gas - less than 3% of its needs - but it pays European prices, so it doesn't make much difference. On the other hand, Boris Johnson has announced that it's time to remove that dependency on Russian oil and gas, and he appeared to be speaking for western allies when he did so. He hasn't said how, or how fast. But if that is serious, we could be looking at an embargo on importing Russian energy. Asia shares rebound after Ukraine sanctions\nWarning UK energy bills could top £3,000 a year\nWhy Ukraine crisis could cause global price rises\nUK sanctions target Russian banks and oligarchs That would inflict pain on Russia - it depends on hydrocarbons for around a third of its government revenue, and its economy fluctuates with the volatile fortunes of the industry. For now, with prices high, the same countries that condemn the invasion of Ukraine are paying Russia a lot of foreign currency to keep warm, generate their electricity and fuel their factories. They/we are paying for Russia's war machine. So there is a calculation: who moves first to cut energy supplies? Can Europe and the UK face the immediate consequences of sky-high gas prices, and will US consumers take the pain of even higher oil prices? On the other hand, can Russia face the long-term consequences of losing its best customers, mindful that China and other Asian markets offers it alternative opportunities? In a contest of which side is willing to sustain the deepest hardships, Russia's self-image - from its experience of the Second World War - is to assume it can outdo any adversary and play a long game. Compared with gas flowing down pipelines, oil supply is more easily sourced elsewhere and shipped. Russia is currently the third biggest supplier of crude and refined oil to Britain. That includes around 20% of Britain's diesel, coming from Russian refineries, and more routed through a Swedish refinery. In the year to last September, British imports from Russia included £2.6bn worth of refined oil, £1bn of crude oil and £600,000 of natural gas - HMRC figures break that down for Scotland for 2019: £367m worth of imports, of which £280m was oil and gas. The return flow included £50m of power generating equipment and £21m of whisky, totalling £194m worth of Scottish exports. One element that has gone was the Russian coal for Longannet power station. Britain could get its diesel elsewhere, but without Russia in the market, assume prices will go up sharply. There probably won't be shortages, but with demand outstripping supply, price is the way of rationing. Some energy analysts are already guessing at peaks within this year of between $120 and $150 dollars per barrel of Brent crude. It has now passed through the $100 level, having risen more than 50% in the past year. The consequences come home to petrol and diesel, already at record prices, to heating for those off the gas grid and to numerous industrial uses for oil, including haulage and aviation. They also come home to the debate about the future of the oil and gas industry. Three months ago, at Glasgow's COP26 summit, the pressure was building to stop drilling for new reserves and to block development of known fields, such as Cambo to the west of Shetland. That campaign has caused a rift in the Scottish independence movement. The UK government wavered, and has since shifted to a much stronger line in favour of continued drilling. \"Energy security\" will surely be the rationale to allow the industry to keep drilling, whatever the consequences for climate change. The UK government's priority from now will be to end the dependence on Russian oil and gas. For the oil and gas sector in Scotland and beyond, there are opportunities from the new economic war, just as there will be also from the rearmament contracts that can be expected in the defence industry.

Global shares fell on worries of the possible impact of the conflict, but US tech stocks rebounded in late trading. Russia is the second biggest exporter of crude oil, and is also the world's largest natural gas exporter. Brent crude eased from $105 to $98 a barrel,but not before UK petrol prices had hit another record high. The UK imports 6% of its crude oil and 5% of its gas from Russia, but there are concerns sanctions could constrict supplies and drive up prices worldwide. The price of UK natural gas futures soared nearly 60% on Thursday. UK consumers are already paying a high price for energy and fuel, with demand surging following the easing of Covid restrictions. Russia launches military operation in Ukraine\nWhat sanctions are being imposed on Russia? Both the RAC and AA motoring groups said average petrol prices hit a record high of nearly 149.5p on Wednesday, with diesel at 152.83p. The RAC said that if the oil price reached $110 a barrel the average price of petrol could hit £1.55 a litre. If prices do get this high it will \"cause untold financial difficulties for many people who depend on their cars for getting to work and running their lives as it would sky rocket the cost of a full tank to £85\", said the RAC's Simon Williams. Petrol price movements in the UK are mainly determined by the price of crude oil, and the exchange rate between the dollar and the pound, because crude oil is traded in dollars. The price of crude oil is up, and the pound is down against the dollar. News of Russia's actions led to steep falls on global stock markets. In Europe, the UK's FTSE 100 index fell more 3.9%, its biggest one-day fall since June 2020. Germany's Dax index lost 4%. In the US, the Dow Jones fell nearly 2% in early trading but a late rally in the tech sector meant in ended 0.3% higher. The tech-heavy Nasdaq index climbed 3.3% and the S&P 500 closed trading up 1.5%. Shares in Netflix and Microsoft were both up more than 5%, respectively. After talking with allies from the G7, US President Biden announced measures to impede Russia's ability to do business in the world's major currencies, along with sanctions against banks and state-owned companies. Wall Street which traded in the red at the start of the day on news of Russia's invasion of Ukraine, hit session highs in the wake of Biden's comments. The Moscow Stock Exchange saw trading suspended briefly, but when it reopened the index fell by more than a third. On the currency markets, the rouble sank to a record low against the US dollar. The price of gold - which is considered a haven asset in times of uncertainty - jumped 3% to its highest price in more than a year. Will Russia-Ukraine tensions push up UK gas bills?\nEurope gas prices: How far is Russia responsible? Russ Mould, investment director at AJ Bell, said the oil price surge \"was terrible news for businesses and consumers\" because \"it will serve to further stoke inflation\". \"Not only will energy bills keep going up, but food prices look set to jump even higher. Ukraine and Russia are both big food suppliers and any disruption to supplies will force buyers to seek alternative sources, which could jack up prices.\" The UK's cost of living is rising at its fastest rate in 30 years, as energy, fuel and food prices continued to soar, squeezing household budgets. Meanwhile, Mr Mould said the fall in the FTSE 100 \"was bad news for the millions of savers and investors who have money in UK equities\". Europe gets nearly a third of its oil and around 40% of its gas from Russia, much of it flowing through pipelines across Ukrainian territory. Small wonder then that prices are shooting up. Brent crude oil has gone above $100 a barrel, while prices for gas on wholesale markets - where domestic suppliers buy what they need - are up sharply as well. Supplies from Russia do not appear to have been affected - yet. But the fear that they will be, and that there could be a scramble for other resources, is pushing up costs. Stock markets across Europe are tumbling, as investors fret about the potential economic impact of high energy prices and the potential for much wider sanctions as well. And as for Russian shares, a graph showing the performance of the MOEX stock exchange in Moscow looks like a cliff in the Ural mountains today. In response to Russia's military action, the UK, US and European Union are set to put more sanctions on Russia. There are fears that sanctions, along with the impact of the invasion, could disrupt the supply of agricultural products and raw materials from Ukraine and Russia. The two countries combined are major wheat suppliers, producing 29% of global exports, most of which travels through ports in the Black Sea. Russia also produces aluminium, cobalt, copper, diamonds, fertiliser, gold, nickel, palladium, platinum, titanium and steel. The European Council said it would \"impose massive and severe consequences on Russia for its actions\". Ursula von der Leyen, President of the European Commission, said the sanctions \"will target strategic sectors of the Russian economy by blocking their access to technologies and markets that are key for Russia\". Russian assets in the EU will be frozen and Russian banks' access to European financial markets will be stopped, she said. \"These sanctions are designed to take a heavy toll on the Kremlin's interests and their ability to finance war,\" she added. The biggest economic hit would come from disconnecting Russia's banking system from the international Swift payment system, but that could also affect the US and European economies. The US and EU have already imposed a series of sanctions in response to Mr Putin's actions against Ukraine. The UK has frozen the assets of five banks and three Russian billionaires, who have also been hit with travel bans. Meanwhile Germany has frozen final approval for the Nord Stream 2 gas pipeline, which connects the country with Russia and was set to boost Russian gas exports to the EU. ",

            "content": "Household energy bills could top £3,000 a year in England, Wales and Scotland from October, in part due to the Ukraine crisis, a report has warned. The bank Investec said the conflict, along with surging global demand, had made gas and electricity prices soar. It expects the energy price cap, which limits what suppliers can charge, to hit £3,238 a year for the average home when it's next adjusted in October. The cap is already due to rise by £693 to £1,971 in April. Investec analyst Martin Young said a further rise in October, which would impact about 22 million households in England, Wales and Scotland, would be \"devastating\". He said such an increase would \"plunge many people into fuel poverty\", with many facing an \"eat or heat dilemma in the winter season\". \"Absent sharp and significant declines in wholesale prices, we expect a significant jump in the cap in October,\" he said. Will Russia's invasion of Ukraine push up gas bills?\nOil hits new high and shares sink as Russia invades UK gas and electricity prices have been rising for months, due to surging global demand following the end of pandemic restrictions. However, Investec said prices had risen even higher following Russia's invasion of Ukraine and would remain elevated for months. Russia is the world's largest natural gas exporter, and there are concerns western sanctions could push President Vladimir Putin to \"weaponise\" his resources and constrict supplies to Europe. That would drive up wholesale prices worldwide, including in the UK, which gets little of its gas from Russia directly. Nathan Piper, oil and gas analyst at Investec, told the BBC: \"Disruption to the flow of gas [from Russia to Europe] would result in extremely high prices with no real alternatives. \"So, we were tight in Europe with domestic production declining and the invasion of Ukraine has raised stakes higher.\" Energy bills have soared in the last six months due to a record increase in global gas prices. It has led to almost 30, mostly smaller energy firms, going bust due to suppliers being unable to deliver price promises and has affected 4.3 million domestic customers. It has come at time when the prices of food, manufactured goods and fuel are also soaring, squeezing household budgets. The UK inflation rate is currently at a 30-year high of 5.5%. The government has said millions of households will receive energy bill discounts totalling £350 from October to ease the crisis. However, £200 of this will be repayable, and Mr Young called the support \"little more than a poorly disguised loan\". \"Energy is likely to intensify as a political crisis for the government,\" he said. \"We suggest that a return to the drawing board is necessary to ensure support is there for those that need it, and if this means tough decisions for the chancellor then these decisions must be made.\" ",

            "content": "For small business owner Cathy Frost, the removal of all coronavirus rules in England from Thursday \"seems a bit too quick\". Ms Frost, who runs a small independent gift and homeware shop, is one of several firms urging her staff to isolate if they test positive for Covid. She also hopes to continue testing workers twice a week but is worried about the new costs for them, with tests no longer free for most people from 1 April. \"I feel conflicted as, while we're keen to get back to normality on the High Street, we need to protect ourselves and our customers,\" she said. Ms Frost is not alone. While business groups have broadly welcomed the government's latest \"Living with Covid\" plan after almost two years of restrictions, some firms are nervous about the changes. Workers face terrible choice over Covid, says TUC\nWhat are the UK's 'Living with Covid' plans?\nLiving with Covid plan to restore our freedom - PM From today, people with Covid will no longer be legally required to self-isolate but guidance will remain in place for those who test positive to stay at home for at least five days. Workers will also no longer be required to tell their employer if they need to self-isolate. Ms Frost will continue to ask her two self-employed workers at her Ipswich-based business to isolate if they test positive, which she said was \"the right thing to do\". \"I would not come into work [with Covid] and I would not expect my two members of staff to,\" she added. Given her staff are self-employed and not entitled to statutory sick pay, Ms Frost said she would \"make sure they were ok\" if they needed to isolate. Natalie Faulkner, owner of salon Beauty With Inn in Northampton, also wants her five staff to isolate if they test positive, but she said her business would be unable to pay them. She said she didn't think her customers would feel safe if a member of staff who had Covid was doing their hair. The salon lost £4,000 from cancelled appointments due to Omicron cases in December so Ms Faulkner said she is keen to avoid having to \"suck up all the costs\" from any potential cases arising in the shop. The British Independent Retailers Association (Bira) said the removal of Covid restrictions \"should be positive for retail and the High Street in general\", but said \"clear messages\" for staff were needed. Scientists have offered different opinions on restrictions being removed. Prof Sir Andrew Pollard, who helped develop the Oxford-AstraZeneca vaccine, has said that \"there isn't a right or wrong answer\" to when restrictions change. Meanwhile, Prof Anthony Costello, professor of global health and sustainable development at UCL, had said there was a worry that \"we are telling not only our population, but the world, that there is really nothing to worry about, that it's all over, when it isn't\". However, some business owners feel little trepidation about the change of rules. Hotelier Sir Rocco Forte, chairman of Rocco Forte Hotels, said if a employee tested positive for Covid he would allow them to come into work if they felt well enough. \"The reality of this is we are saying Covid isn't a pandemic anymore. It's an endemic disease like flu it should be treated like flu,\" he told the BBC's World at One. \"You don't test every worker who falls ill with flu. You tell people to stay at home if they are not feeling well.\" UK Hospitality has estimated restaurants, hotels and pubs have lost £115bn since the start of the pandemic. Matt Shiells-Jones, a hotel manager in Manchester, said his business was allowing staff to \"self-determine\" over whether they isolated or not under its sickness policy, which gives staff the option to accumulate time in lieu, used banked overtime, take holiday pay, or get statutory sick pay. \"Sickness is a part of running a business with people and it is ultimately my responsibility to be prepared for that; ultimately if I cant be prepared for this after all this time operating under measures, then I haven't learnt any lessons or made the changes needed to be a valuable employer post-Covid,\" he said. But it's not just employers who are grappling with the new Covid conundrum, workers are as well. Sarah, who works in financial services, is apprehensive over the removal of all restrictions as she takes immunosuppressant medication for multiple sclerosis. While her boss has allowed her to continue to work from home, she said she is worries of the wider implications for vulnerable people. Sarah, who has received four jabs, said she felt that she \"will now be excluded\" from restaurants and other places she used to love. \"It creates a two-tier society of the vulnerable and everyone else,\" she added. The Trades Union Congress, who has said people should not be forced into making a \"terrible choice\" over going into work with Covid or risking losing income by self-isolating at home. The union has also raised concerns that lower-paid staff will face the toughest choice, with up to two million workers not qualifying for sick pay due to the amount they earn. ",

            "content": "City centre offices are going to be \"more important than ever\" for companies with hybrid working plans, the boss of insurer Admiral has said. The FTSE 100 company's UK CEO Cristina Nestares said offices must be attractive for staff to \"make an effort, commute, come to the office\". The company has sites in Cardiff, Swansea and Newport and is offering staff a mix of home and office working. Meanwhile desks are appearing in gyms as alternatives to working from home. Lockdown home working \"was tough and it did cause some problems\" for younger colleagues at Admiral, Ms Nestares said. Hybrid working is here to stay, say managers\nSenedd must become more family-friendly, politicians say\nFour-day working week pilot bid for Welsh workers Since being established in Cardiff in 1993, Admiral has grown to employ about 7,000 staff in south Wales and a further 4,000 at other locations in the UK, Europe and the USA. Ms Nestares said the city centre office spaces have \"always been important - location, location, location - but it is going to be even more so in the future\". She added: \"We are going to ask our staff, a lot of whom are very comfortable working from home, we are going to say: 'Make an effort, commute, come to the office'.\" Bookable desks, break-out areas and re-designed floors are currently being introduced at the company's headquarters in Cardiff city centre. \"We want the office experience to be fantastic, in the office and outside,\" Ms Nestares said. Admiral is regularly ranked among the best employers for staff satisfaction and wellbeing, but Ms Nestares said the immediate switch to home working at the start of the pandemic caused issues for some employees. \"We soon realised that for the younger segment of our staff, it was actually harder,\" she said. \"They were the ones who maybe lived by themselves, or they didn't have a big house, and it was a bit too much - they were missing the social interaction. \"So as long as the rules allowed us, we tried to organise events in parks. We had some people come into the office if they had problems at home, or they had some mental health issues.\" Admiral said it would continue to develop its hybrid model and respond to feedback from staff. Other companies are pursuing similar strategies, while some staff seek alternatives to working from a spare room or on the kitchen table. Rebekah Windsor, 27, is always at the gym, so it made sense for her to take her laptop with her to catch up on her to-do list between workouts. She is a personal trainer and uses One Gym in Newport for her own workouts. The gym recently added hot-desks, giving her somewhere other than home to catch up on the paperwork that comes with her job. \"Going back and forth to home to do my admin would not be beneficial to me at all,\" she said. \"Coming here to train and then quickly catch up on my admin is ideal.\" It's not just for gym types. Managers said they had attracted a regular crowd who want desk space without the office commute. Ms Windsor thinks other gyms should invest in work spaces. \"More people are working at home now, a lot of my clients are working from home and they are struggling a lot with motivation,\" she said. \"So I think coming here to train and then knowing you can get an extra hour of work in, get your to-dos done, I think it is definitely something that they should start introducing.\" While workers are making the most of flexible options, the future of city centre offices seems secure. Admiral has reduced the number of buildings it uses across south Wales from seven to five, but is otherwise committed to the future of offices. In Cardiff, many of the newest buildings around the city's Central Station are owned by pension fund manager Legal and General. \"You have always got to look at the fundamentals,\" said Tom Roberts, who is the firm's head of strategic investment. \"Where are the right opportunities to focus on? Where are the best places to invest? Where do people want to be? \"But I think certainly for the long-term, the amenities that city centres offer and the public transport connectivity are such important considerations. \"That's why we think city centres will continue to thrive.\" ",

            "header": "1MDB: Trial of ex-Goldman banker paused after documents blunder",
            "content": "The trial of a former Goldman Sachs banker who allegedly siphoned millions of dollars from Malaysia's beleaguered 1MDB sovereign wealth fund has been paused in the US, because of an \"inexcusable\" blunder by prosecutors. Prosecutors admit they did not share more than 15,500 documents with the defence lawyers representing Roger Ng. These relate to their star witness Tim Leissner, who was Mr Ng's boss. A judge ruled to halt the proceedings without setting a date for resumption. On Wednesday, US District Judge Margo Brodie ordered a \"break in the trial\" centred on 1MDB, an investment fund set up by the Malaysian government that lost billions of dollars due to fraudulent activity. She asked defence lawyer Marc Agnifilo to decide how much time he needed to go through the evidence, while adding: \"I will give you as much time as you need\". Assistant US Attorney Alixandra Smith described the blunder as an \"inexcusable error\". Mr Agnifilo has said he may ask for a mistrial \"depending on what this information is\". His client Roger Ng, Goldman's former head of investment banking in Malaysia, has been charged with conspiring to launder money and violating anti-bribery law. Prosecutors say Mr Ng, who worked for Goldman from 2005 to May 2014, received $35m (£26.1m) in kickbacks for his role in the scheme. If found guilty, Mr Ng faces up to 20 years in jail for a money laundering charge and five years for each of two bribery charges. He has pleaded not guilty to all charges. Meanwhile, Mr Leissner, who is a witness for the prosecution, pleaded guilty to similar charges in 2018. He previously headed the bank's South East Asia unit. Ex-Goldman Malaysia boss on trial over 1MDB case\nEx-Goldman banker: 'Bribes' made business possible Prosecutors believe the two men helped divert billions of dollars from 1MDB. They say $4.5bn of the money was used as bribes for Malaysian politicians and others, who spent their gains on art, jewellery and property. In court last week, Mr Leissner described Mr Ng as a key banker for 1MDB transactions, in which Goldman helped to raise $6.5bn for the fund through a series of bond deals. He said they were hailed as \"heroes\" within the bank for bringing in the business, which brought Goldman roughly $600m in fees. Investigators subsequently found that the proceeds from the bonds, sold from 2009 to 2014, were largely stolen. As a result Goldman Sachs spent years being investigated by regulators around the world. In 2020, the firm reached a $3.9bn settlement with the Malaysian government for its role in the multi-billion-dollar corruption scheme. It also paid nearly $3bn to authorities in four countries to end an investigation into work it performed for 1MDB. The same year, Malaysia's former Prime Minister Najib Razak was sentenced to 12 years in jail after he was found guilty of abusing his power, laundering money and breaching the public's trust. ",

            "content": "Average UK petrol and diesel prices have hit new highs as the Ukraine crisis continues to affect oil prices, the RAC has said. On Wednesday, petrol prices rose to 149.30p per litre amid warnings it could soon pass £1.50. Oil prices jumped after Russia ordered troops into two Ukrainian regions this week to \"maintain peace\". Wholesale gas prices also continue to climb, threatening to further push up heating bills. Russia is the world's second-largest oil exporter after Saudi Arabia and the top producer of natural gas globally. The UK only gets 6% of its crude oil and 5% of its gas from Russia, but there are concerns sanctions could constrict supplies and drive up prices worldwide. UK consumers are already paying a high price for energy and fuel, with demand surging following the easing of Covid restrictions. Oil prices surge as Ukraine-Russia tensions climb\nPutin tells Russians security is non-negotiable Former National Grid boss Steve Holliday told the BBC's Today programme: \"For the UK, it's a price issue, it's not a security supply issue. \"We already know that we've got consumers that are already experiencing huge jumps in their energy bills, so this is really very unwelcome.\" The price of Brent crude oil, an international benchmark, hit a seven-year high of more than $99 (£73) on Tuesday before falling back on Wednesday. However, fuel pump prices lag behind oil prices and the RAC has warned petrol could go higher than £1.50 a litre in the coming days. Diesel has also risen, hitting 152.68p a litre on Wednesday. Matt Williams, 30, runs Williams & Yates, a removals company that operates across the UK and Europe with a fleet of 11 vans and lorries. Rising fuel costs have forced it to put up its prices and he fears it might impact the business in the months ahead. \"Unfortunately, we do have to pass [these costs] onto the customer,\" he told the BBC. \"All the competition has to do the same, but I think it does make some consumers reconsider their moving options.\" The firm offers basic and bespoke services, and he expects more customers to choose the cheaper option in the coming months rather than \"paying loads of money\". Gordon Balmer, executive director of the Petrol Retailers Association, a trade body for independent UK forecourts, said whether fuel prices continue to rise depends on a number of factors. \"If [conflict] really sparks off in Ukraine, we could prices escalating dramatically,\" he said. However, he added that the US is in the process of negotiating a nuclear deal with Iran which could see more oil come onto the market. UK wholesale gas prices also jumped following Germany's decision on Tuesday to halt the final approval of Nord Stream 2 - a new gas pipeline connecting the country with Russia. That decision drew a swift response from Dmitry Medvedev, Russia's former president and now deputy chairman of its Security Council. The BBC is not responsible for the content of external sites.\nView original tweet on Twitter \"Well, welcome to the brave new world where Europeans are very soon going to pay €2,000 for 1,000 cubic meters of natural gas!\" he tweeted - suggesting prices were set to double. UK gas prices for delivery in March rose by 13.5p to 200p per therm, though that is still much lower than the highs of December last year, when it peaked at over 400p per therm. Western nations and Japan on Tuesday punished Russia with new sanctions for ordering troops into separatist regions of eastern Ukraine. The UK said it was ready to impose further sanctions in the event of a full invasion of Ukraine, targeting more Russian banks and individuals as well as companies in the energy, defence, technology and chemical sectors. After a volatile trading session on Tuesday, global stock markets climbed on Wednesday before falling back again. Towards the end of the day, the UK's FTSE 100 was flat while France's CAC-40 and Germany's Dax had lost between 0.2% and 0.5%. The main three US indexes were all in the red. High energy prices in the UK have played a major part in pushing up the cost of living recently, while wages have lagged behind price rises. Inflation currently stands at 5.5% - its highest level in 30 years. Speaking to the Treasury Select Committee of MPs on Wednesday, Jonathan Haskel, a member of the Bank of England's Monetary Policy Committee, said energy prices accounted for nearly half of the rise in inflation over the last year. That is likely to rise to 70% in the first three months of 2022, according to Bank of England governor Andrew Bailey. The Bank deputy governor, Ben Broadbent, said: \"If you look at the increase in energy bills this year, it is just about twice as big as any single year in the 1970s - it is enormous.\" The Bank expects inflation to hit 7% in spring when the price cap on household energy bills is raised. This is far above the Bank of England's 2% target. From April, about 18 million homes on standard tariffs will see an average increase of £693. Meanwhile, 4.5 million prepayment customers can expect their energy costs to rise by an average £708. Consumers are also being squeezed by rising prices on goods as many companies pass on higher costs such as fuel, shipping and wages to their customers. As well as the rise in energy prices in April, staff, companies and the self-employed will also have to pay an extra 1.25p on the pound in National Insurance. The rise is being introduced by the government to fund health and social care. ",

It joins the National Portrait Gallery, which announced the end of its partnership with BP on Tuesday. Campaigners have urged the arts and culture sector to cut all ties to oil companies over claims of greenwashing. BP said it was proud of the 10-year partnership, which Scottish Ballet said had reached a \"natural conclusion\". The dance company acknowledged the long-term support of BP, particularly in helping the company tour to Aberdeen. A Scottish Ballet spokesperson said it had decided against renewing its sponsorship agreement with BP on 31 January. They said the energy firm no longer \"aligns with the company's green action plan - to be carbon neutral by 2030\". Scottish Ballet was pressured by climate activists to cut ties with BP during Cop26 in Glasgow, in November last year. They claimed oil and gas companies failed to promise a shift to cleaner energy and were sponsoring cultural institutions to \"greenwash\" their reputations. Other leading art institutions, including the Royal Shakespeare Company and Tate, have already ended sponsorship deals with BP following environmental campaigns by artists and employees. A spokeswoman for BP confirmed Scottish Ballet's decision to end its deal with the oil firm at the end of January, adding: \"We are proud of our partnership, sponsoring the company for nearly 10 years and latterly supporting their sustainability strategy. \"We continue to partner the British Museum and the Royal Opera House and, in Scotland, Aberdeen Gallery.\" ",

Fines for late filing have been delayed by a month beyond the normal deadline of 31 January. Interest is already building up on any unpaid tax, and anyone who fails to complete their return by the end of February faces an additional £100 fine. HMRC and tax experts are urging people not to leave it to the last minute. Myrtle Lloyd, HMRC's director general for customer services, said there was support available for anyone struggling to complete the required details online. Victoria Todd, head of the Low Incomes Tax Reform Group, said: \"Leaving it until the last minute risks a late filing penalty if something unforeseen happens to prevent you from filing on or before 28 February.\" More than 12 million people, including the self-employed and those with more than one source of income, are required to complete self-assessment forms. The vast majority do so online. The deadline was 31 January for online returns and there is an earlier deadline of 31 October for returns on paper. However, for the second consecutive year, the normal £100 fine for filing late online was waived by HMRC until the end of February, given some people have been delayed by Covid.

The UK's biggest airport does not expect passenger numbers to return to pre-pandemic levels until 2025 or 2026, boss John Holland Kaye said. The airport had a weak start to the year, with January and February numbers almost a quarter lower than expected. But it predicts \"a surge of Brits heading for summer sun\" in 2022. Heathrow passenger numbers in 2021 fell to 19.4 million, down from 22 million in 2020 and the lowest since 1972. Before the pandemic the airport had about 80 million passengers per year. The airport said it was the only European travel hub to see a reduction in passengers last year, and said that was due to the UK having tighter Covid travel restrictions than most European Union countries. European airports which reported an increase in passengers in 2021 compared with 2020 included Frankfurt, Amsterdam Schiphol and Paris Charles de Gaulle. How are travel rules being relaxed?\nBA blames luggage delays on high winds Mr Holland Kaye told the BBC's Radio 4 Today programme: \"It's going to take a little time, a few years, before we get back to the kind of passenger numbers we experienced before the pandemic. \"I think it'll be probably 2025, 2026, before we fully get back there.\" He added: \"We need to not only get rid of all of the testing and quarantine requirements that exist around the world, but also the risk that new requirements will be imposed at short notice that could mean you're stuck in a country you don't want to be in, because of a new variant of concern.\" \"That's exactly what happened early in December, and passengers need to be confident that's not going to happen again if we have another variant of concern,\" he said. Heathrow said that the UK removing testing restrictions had boosted the number of tourists wanting to go abroad, but tourism and business travel coming into the UK was \"suppressed due to testing in other countries\". There were lower than expected passenger numbers in January and February, but the airport predicted a boom in summer travel that would help it get to its target of 45.5 million passengers in 2022. Heathrow said it had made cost savings of £870m over the past two years, but it said losses during the pandemic had risen to £3.8bn due to lower passenger numbers and \"high fixed costs\". ",

            "content": "The South Korean entertainment company behind K-pop band BTS has seen a surge in profits, despite making less money from concerts during the pandemic. Hybe says its operating profits jumped by 30.8% in the past year. It almost tripled its revenue from content, such as games and digital comics featuring the popular group. The firm, which was previously named Big Hit Entertainment, also owns the management company representing singers such as Ariana Grande. Speaking to investors on Tuesday, Hybe chief executive Park Ji-won said the company planned to \"carry out its game and publishing business in earnest\". He said it planned to invest in game developers and \"provide a variety of entertainment in the soon-to-be-unfolded metaverse\". That came after the firm reported a surge in operating profits to 190.3bn won (£118m; $160m) last year. Revenue from its content business rose from 132.3bn won to 370.4bn. Its takings from merchandise also grew, and that from advertisements, artist appearances and their management more than doubled. BTS take top honours at American Music Awards\nCornish musician writing songs for K-pop stars BTS Hybe had gained ground with K-pop fans through the Weverse platform, that allows them to connect with artists and buy exclusive content. It is in the process of launching non-fungible tokens or NFTs. While these have been touted as the digital answer to collectables, critics have warned about risks in the market. The firm also plans to release another mobile game and improve Rhythm Hive, where players tap along to music by BTS and other South Korean bands. They collect and buy \"gems\" that could be used for virtual purchases. However, concerts have seen a slow recovery. Hybe's earnings from performances were under a quarter of what they were in 2019. In 2020, BTS - one of the biggest revenue generators for Hybe - called off what was supposed to be their largest international tour with almost 40 concerts, because of the pandemic. The seven-member group held online shows instead. In November, they performed in Los Angeles, marking their first in-person concert since the pandemic began. Five of its members have contracted Covid-19 after returning to Seoul. The band has since scheduled three concerts in the city and a series of performances in Las Vegas. ",

Earlier, Japan's Nikkei 225 index closed 1.7% lower, and the Shanghai Composite fell nearly 1%, but share indexes in Europe and the UK ended roughly flat, with the FTSE 100 closing up 0.1%. \"The West at the moment is treading fairly carefully,\" said Russ Mould, investment director at the brokers AJ Bell. Russia is the second-largest oil exporter after Saudi Arabia and the world's top producer of natural gas. Measures forcing the country to supply less crude or natural gas would have \"substantial implications\" on oil prices and the global economy, said Sue Trinh of Manulife Investment Management. PM announces UK sanctions against Russia\nRussia recognises Ukraine separatist regions\nWhat sanctions could be imposed on Russia? The RAC warned the crisis would push up UK petrol prices further, after they hit a record 149.12p a litre on Sunday. \"Russia's decision to invade Ukraine is already causing oil prices to rise and will undoubtedly send fuel prices inexorably higher towards the grim milestone of £1.50 a litre [of unleaded petrol],\" said RAC fuel spokesman Simon Williams. \"This spells bad news for drivers in the UK struggling to afford to put fuel in their cars.\" But the steps announced by the US, UK and Europe so far fall short of what had been threatened in the event of invasion. The sanctions target financial institutions, elites and other government entities in Russia, in part aiming to restrict the Russian government's ability to raise money on Western financial markets. On Tuesday, German Chancellor Olaf Scholz also took the significant step of blocking the certification of the Nord Stream 2 pipeline that would have supplied gas directly from Russia to Germany. \"If Russian goes further with this invasion, we stand prepared to go further,\" US President Joe Biden said in remarks at the White House. He also warned that defending Nato territory could come at a cost to the public in the form of higher energy prices. Since the start of February, already-rising oil prices have jumped more than 10% amid the tensions. Maike Currie, an investment director at Fidelity International, said oil could go above $100 a barrel due to a combination of the Ukraine crisis, a cold winter in the US, and a lack of investment in oil and gas supplies around the world. \"Russia accounts for one in every 10 barrels of oil consumed globally, so it is a major player when it comes to the price of oil, and of course, it's really going to hurt consumers at the petrol pumps,\" she said. Russia has spent years preparing for this moment. In 2014, when Russian troops moved into Crimea, annexing part of Ukraine, it provoked a first round of international sanctions. And that taught Moscow an important lesson. Since then it's been setting up defences, moving away from relying on the dollar, and trying to sanction-proof the Russian economy. President Putin may be betting that he can withstand sanctions for longer than the West assumes. Read more Most of the oil and gas that the UK imports does not come from Russia, but it would nonetheless be affected by a rise in global prices. Average diesel prices in the UK hit 152.51p a litre on Monday, just below Sunday's record of 152.58p, the RAC said. UK wholesale gas prices have also jumped, with the UK price for April delivery up 9% and the cost for May up 10% to 191p per therm. However, that remained lower than the highs seen in December last year, when it peaked at over 400p per therm. The economic inter-dependence between Russia and Europe is likely to limit Western actions going forward, said Shaistah Akhtar, an expert on sanctions law from the UK law firm Mishcon de Reya. But some of the restraint so far is deliberate, she added. \"They needed to allow some room to manoeuvre,\" she said. Edward Gardner, commodities economist at Capital Economics said the tensions are likely to keep oil prices elevated, even if the West does not take more aggressive action. \"It is not in the economic interests of either Russia or the West to use trade in energy as a weapon against each other, but that is not to say it won't happen,\" he wrote in a note on Tuesday. \"Even if the West does not implement direct sanctions on Russia's energy exports, tensions with Russia could keep oil prices higher for longer.\" ",

            "content": "A woman who was unfairly dismissed from her job after her male employer shouted that \"she must be on her menopause\" has been awarded £20,000. Leigh Best, 54, was dismissed as a sales assistant for pet food retailer Embark on Raw, based near Billericay, Essex, for raising Covid-19 safety concerns, an employment tribunal found. It said she was harassed due to her age and sex and she was victimised. This left her feeling \"humiliated and mortified\" by her treatment, it found. The total amount she was awarded at the East London Hearing Centre was £20,057.74. This included £680 for loss of wages, a further £4,000 for harassment and victimisation, as well as £10,000 in relation to unlawful detriment. Interest and an \"uplift\" was added to the figure. Mrs Best was employed by the company, which sells raw food for cats and dogs, from 29 January 2020 until 11 May that year, and was co-directed by husband and wife, David and Andrea Fletcher. The tribunal hearing heard Mr Fletcher had shouted that \"she must be on her menopause\" on 20 March 2020 during an argument about a mix-up with orders. A sum of £2,000 was awarded towards the harassment as it was found that Mrs Best was upset by Fletcher's \"unwanted, obtrusive and inappropriate questioning about whether or not she was menopausal\". She said she found the subject \"distressing and wished to avoid talking about it\" and it was a \"private matter\". The highest award of £10,000 was given for the company failing to \"properly investigate\" Mrs Best's complaints about Covid safety and a colleague's complaints that they were unable to work with her. \"As a result no informed and balanced view of these matters was formulated or implemented\", the ruling found. Her dismissal was \"flawed\" and she was left \"misinformed, humiliated and mortified by this treatment\". The total sum was due 28 days after the judgement, which was sent to the company on 17 February, the tribunal said. Find BBC News: East of England on Facebook, Instagram and Twitter.

            "header": "UK's farming policies contradictory, says NFU head",
            "content": "The government has contradictory policies on farming and risks \"repeatedly running into crises\", the National Farmers Union head has warned. In a conference speech, Minette Batters said farming was facing major issues in \"an increasingly unstable world\". The UK needed a clear vision to overcome challenges in food production, trade and labour, she said. Environment Secretary George Eustice defended the government and outlined further funding. Addressing the National Farmers' Union (NFU) conference on Tuesday, Mr Eustice said he recognised the strain caused by challenges such as rising production costs but promised to support the industry towards a \"bright future\". He announced more funding for farmers, including plans for a programme of financial support for farmers in the pig, cattle, sheep and poultry sectors. Based around animal health and welfare, the programme will fund investments such as equipment and technology or upgrades to infrastructure. Mr Eustice's department, Defra, announced funding worth £48.5m to help finance equipment in the farming, horticultural and forestry sectors. The NFU's president welcomed the increase in funding but, speaking to Mr Eustice after his speech, was particularly critical of the situation in the pig sector, which she said \"could have been avoided\". Pig farmer protest urges Defra to help industry\nThousands of pigs culled due to butcher shortage\nPig cull threat not being taken seriously by PM, says vet Last year a shortage of butchers left farms overflowing with piglets, and led to a mass cull. The National Pig Association (NPA) said the current backlog of pigs on farm is estimated to be at least 200,000 and at least 35,000 of the animals have been destroyed. \"This, truly, is an utter disgrace and a disaster for the pig industry,\" Mrs Batters said. \"This is down to government's poorly designed change to immigration policy and what I can only say appears to be their total lack of understanding of how food production works and what it needs.\" The shortage of abattoir workers has been blamed on labour complications caused by Brexit and the Covid-19 pandemic. Mrs Batters warned of a \"looming crisis\" for fruit and vegetable growers following a warning of wage increases for seasonal workers in Home Office guidance. She urged the Home Office to rethink the policy, which she said posed a \"real risk of further food inflation and of British growers going out of business\". In a question-and-answer session after his speech, Mrs Batters asked Mr Eustice if the Home Office's guidance had been issued in error. Mr Eutsice said if \"there has been some error in the guidance we will obviously get that corrected\". He said the minimum wage requirement of £10.10 per hour for seasonal workers would remain but stressed the need to \"create more employment opportunities\" in the UK after Brexit. Asked what support he would give to pig farmers, Mr Eustice said it was \"important that we look at the way this market works\" and \"we may need to bring forward regulations\". ",

            "header": "Inflation sends UK debt interest payments higher",
            "content": "Rising inflation led to government interest payments hitting a record high for the month of January, figures show. Interest payments hit £6.1bn last month, the highest amount for a January since records began in April 1997 and up from £4.5bn last year. The payments are pegged to the Retail Prices Index (RPI) measure of inflation - which reached 7.8% in January. January's interest payments were, however, below the all-time high of £9bn in June last year. Paul Johnson, director of the Institute for Fiscal Studies, told the BBC it was worth noting that \"overall interest payments by the government are still at remarkably low levels\" despite UK debt levels at the highest for 60 years. \"Year after year interest payments have come in below expectations and that has given the chancellor additional wiggle room,\" he said. The Office for National Statistics (ONS) said government finances recorded a surplus of £2.9bn last month as the economy opened up from lockdowns and tax receipts improved. The surplus compares with a £2.5bn deficit in January 2021 - when spending on coronavirus support measures was higher. However, the latest figure is still a £7bn smaller surplus than in January 2020, before the pandemic. Where does the government borrow billions from? UK economy rebounds with fastest growth since WW2 UK finances are normally healthier in January as self-assessment income tax receipts come in. Revenues from self-assessed tax was £18.4bn last month, an increase of £2bn from a year earlier. Borrowing from the end of March to January was £138.5bn - the second highest for the period since records began in 1993. Mr Johnson told the BBC the figures showed \"we are still spending an awful lot more. We are poorer than we were.\" But he said the bigger picture was that the deficit - the gap between spending and tax receipts - was coming down quickly. Some big tax rises this year will also mean the government borrowing less, he added. January is normally a month when the Treasury reaps the benefit of large tax payments from self-employed workers, with more money coming in than going out. The public sector finances were always going to look comfortable compared with the same month last year when the lockdown over Christmas and the new year dented economic activity. But a surplus of £2.9bn in January 2022 is still £7bn less than before the pandemic, reflecting the impact of Omicron. It's notable that borrowing in the financial year to date has more than halved, down by £140bn, before the Chancellor Rishi Sunak's forthcoming tax rises have taken effect. That illustrates a point already evident from the efforts in the past 13 years of successive chancellors, first Labour then Conservative, to fix the public finances by imposing austerity: namely, it's not so much what the chancellor does, but what the economy does, that most effectively cuts government borrowing. Chancellor Rishi Sunak said the government had \"provided unprecedented support\" through the pandemic. \"But our debt has increased substantially and there are further pressures on the public finances, including from rising inflation,\" he said. \"Keeping the public finances on a sustainable path is crucial so we can continue helping the British people when needed, without burdening future generations with high debt repayments.\" The ONS figures showed that total public sector debt stood at £2.32 trillion at the end of the month, or around 94.9% of gross domestic product.

            "content": "Nearly 40% of the board positions at the UK's biggest companies are now held by women, a government-backed review has found. The FTSE Women Leaders Review found 414 women held company board roles at FTSE 100 firms last year, up from 374 in 2020. But the review also exposed a lack of women in executive director roles. Just 13.5% of the executive director positions were held by women in 2021, down from 14.2% the year before. The government suggested that the findings demonstrate a \"major sea-change\" in \"attitudes to getting women leaders to the top table of business\". Although 4 in 10 of UK FTSE 100 board positions were held by women in 2021, the report found that 45.7% of these positions were in non-executive roles, such as senior human resource positions. Out of the 414 women in board roles, 385 were non-executive positions. Just 29 women held executive director positions at the UK's biggest firms last year. Firms with more female executives 'perform better'\nPay gap between men and women fails to improve\nTop 10 tips for diversifying your workplace The review's chief executive, Denise Wilson, has set out new recommendations to increase women's representation in FTSE 350 board and leadership roles to 40% by the end of 2025 and include the UK's largest 50 private companies by sales in the next review. \"While we continue to build on progress for women on boards, we need to firmly shift focus in this next phase to women in leadership roles at the top of the organisation,\" she said. Unlike countries such as France, Norway, the Netherlands and Germany, which have introduced quotas for women in executive and management positions, it is voluntary for UK firms. Dr Grace Lordan, associate professor in behavioural science and founder of The Inclusion Initiative at the London School of Economics, said that \"on the surface, 39.1% looks like a wonderful statistic\". But the fact that there were so few women in executive roles means that women are being assigned roles \"lower in power\" than men at the FTSE 100 firms. \"We need to put the spotlight on positions of strategic importance like the chair, chief executive and chief financial officer roles - not just the non-executive jobs\". Business Secretary Kwasi Kwarteng said that businesses had made \"enormous progress\" despite challenges faced in responding to the pandemic, but acknowledged that firms needed to do more. \"While there has been remarkable progress at boardroom level, the report also shines a light on areas where there is still more to do,\" he said. Minister for Women and Equalities, Liz Truss, said the government was working to advance equality and will put forward a range of measures to \"tackle the issues that are holding women back as we look to ensure that everyone can reach their full potential.\" Co-sponsor of the report, accounting firm KPMG, said that that the \"need to maintain momentum and continually challenge remains\". Chair of KPMG in the UK, Bina Mehta said it is \"important\" to ensure that the \"overflowing pipeline\" of \"well-qualified and capable\" women translates into more women \"chairs, senior independent directors, chief executives and chief finance operators.\" Fiona Cannon, group sustainable business director at Lloyds Banking Group, which also sponsored the report, said the firm welcomes the new target to achieve a minimum of 40% women on boards. \"There is no shortage of talented women; we need to ensure the opportunities are there for them to succeed, she added.

            "content": "People should not be forced into making a \"terrible choice\" over going into work with Covid or risking losing income by self-isolating at home, the Trades Union Congress (TUC) has said. The trade union raised concerns ahead of the just-announced scrapping of the law in England to self-isolate. It said two million workers in low-paid jobs do not qualify for sick pay. Boris Johnson set out plans for the end of all Covid rules in England in the House of Commons this afternoon. From Thursday, the legal requirement to self-isolate after a positive Covid test will be removed in England, the prime minister announced. Self-isolation payments will also end from this date. At the moment, positive or asymptomatic people have to isolate for up to 10 days, but can end their isolation earlier if they register negative lateral flow tests on both days five and six. Leader of the Opposition Sir Keir Starmer said cutting support payments will hit the lowest-paid the hardest. As well as scrapping isolation requirements, Boris Johnson announced the end of free Covid tests for the general public, after the prime minister said £2bn was spent on tests in January. Business Minister Paul Scully told the BBC's Today programme earlier on Monday that the money \"could be spent on other priorities\" as cases and deaths continue to fall. \"We want to get people back into their workplaces, we want to get the economy working, but it will be up to employers and employees,\" he added. Living with Covid plan to restore our freedom - PM\nAre we ready for last Covid rule to be ditched? Kate Bell of the TUC said people who did not qualify for sick pay due to their wages were facing a \"major issue\" over choosing whether to self-isolate with Covid or not. \"If they have got Covid they want to be able to stay at home without facing a terrible choice about whether that means losing income for a week and they want to keep their colleagues safe and the other people they work with safe too,\" she said. \"That shouldn't be a choice that people are forced to make on their own.\" Meanwhile, TUC general secretary Frances O'Grady told the BBC's World at One that workers could not be expected to \"fork out themselves for tests\". \"Just hoping that employers will do the right thing I think is frankly for the birds\", she added. \"Millions of workers need the government to take responsibility and not just gamble on their health, or frankly, our public health.\" The prime minister has said the end to restrictions will return people's freedoms, but some experts have urged caution. Rachel Knappier, director of service at HR company Croner, told the Today programme that it looked like the decision over isolation would be \"put back in the hands\" of employers. She urged workers who were concerned to speak to their employers and said it was \"really important\" businesses have clear policies. The legal requirement to self-isolate for a fixed period after testing positive in England has been in place ever since mass testing was rolled out. Before that, most Covid testing was limited to people as they arrived in hospital with symptoms. Charlene Lyons, chief executive of the Black Sheep Brewery, told the BBC the company would pay for Covid tests for staff \"if we need to\". But she said she did not think the brewer would be \"happy paying them sick pay\" if someone had a dry cough. \"Luckily the majority of people, they can work from home if they need to,\" she added. \"For us, we're trying to adopt a principle whereby this is something we need to live with, it's like flu. \"If you feel unwell you stay off work, if you feel well you come in.\" Ms Lyons said there had been \"various conversations\" with people who felt vulnerable, and added people could be isolated in the company's offices from others. Meanwhile, Chelsea Garside, who runs Ziba Hair and Beauty Salon in Monton in Greater Manchester, said she hoped people would \"use their common sense\" on isolating. \"If you're poorly, you wouldn't come to an appointment. If you had the flu, you wouldn't go to work and risk spreading it,\" she said. Ms Garside said she thought she would provide tests for her team to make it easier for them to come into work and \"create a happy space in the salon\". ",

            "header": "Menzies Aviation faces £560m takeover by Kuwaiti rival",
            "content": "Menzies Aviation, one of Scotland's largest firms, is likely to be taken over by a Kuwait-based rival. The Edinburgh-based ground services company, formerly bookseller John Menzies, works in 37 countries. Three previous offers from National Aviation Services, which works in Africa, Asia and the Middle East, had been rejected. A fourth offer of £560m has now been recommended to shareholders in a statement from company directors. John Menzies: From the high street to the skies The firm started in 1833 selling Charles Dickens books and The Scotsman newspaper, and became a high street name across the UK. It became one of Britain's biggest newspaper distributors, expanding into air freight from 1987. The company cut more than 17,500 jobs worldwide in March 2020 because of the downturn in air travel due to the pandemic, but remained one of Scotland's biggest businesses. National Aviation Services (NAS) is a subsidiary of the Kuwait-based logistics conglomerate Agility. NAS has expanded across emerging markets in recent years and now owns a 19% stake in Menzies Aviation after purchasing millions of pounds worth of shares in the past month. Its final offer of 608p per share follows previous bids of 460p, 510p and 605p. \"The board has considered the final proposal and indicated to NAS that it would be willing unanimously to recommend an offer at the financial terms of the final proposal to Menzies shareholders,\" the board said in a statement. \"Accordingly, the board is in discussions with NAS in relation to these terms and will be providing NAS with access to management and due diligence information.\" It added that NAS had confirmed to the board that \"the financial terms of the final proposal are final and will not be increased,\" although this could change if someone else tried to take over Menzies Aviation. Philipp Joeinig, Menzies Aviation's chairman and chief executive, described previous offers as \"unsolicited and highly opportunistic\" which did not reflect the company's true value. Menzies Aviation has 25,000 employees in 37 countries, providing passenger, baggage and aircraft handling services. Every board of directors has its price, and after some \"highly opportunistic\" attempts at locating it, a Kuwaiti rival has settled on 608 pence per John Menzies share. That's a long way from the 460 pence, and then 510 pence which were dismissed by Menzies' directors as \"highly opportunistic\". It's also a long way from the price in January, which averaged precisely half the level on which buyer and target company have now agreed. The directors' agreement is unanimously to recommend the offer to shareholders. The rest is usually a formality. And so goes another Scottish headquarters, and a company worth more than half a billion pounds - its independence a victim of the consolidation in airport ground handling services. Starting 35 years ago, John Menzies has built up a world-class company in handling cargo and fuelling aircraft. Its roots go back to 1833, in bookselling and publishing, and it became best known in its home country as a distributor and retailer of newspapers, by the 1960s running more than 350 railway station kiosks and 161 other shops. It is 60 years since it floated shares, handing a fifth of them to employees. But the short-termism of the market is what left it vulnerable to a longer-term Kuwaiti investor and rival, with the deep pockets to keep consolidating. Menzies Aviation shed its distribution business in 2018 to focus on aviation, having got the knack of expansion through \"acquisition, innovation and stellar contract wins\". So having expanded at least partly through acquisition, in the Netherlands, USA, Australia, Norway, Sweden and South Africa, then buying the world's largest aircraft-fuelling business, it's hard to criticise when it is itself acquired. It had to move swiftly to adapt, first, to the collapse in cargo trade with the financial crunch of 2008, and drastically to cut staffing when the global aviation industry tanked due to Covid lockdowns. Uncertainty over the pace of the sector's recovery left it vulnerable. The sale highlights the Scottish economy's lack of a healthy pipeline of similar companies. It is also a blow to its local supply chain when Scotland loses the benefits of hosting a large corporate headquarters. ",

            "content": "A shortage of homes being put up for sale has led to rising asking prices and frustration for buyers, two reports suggest. The average asking price for a property in Britain has risen by £7,785 in February compared with last month, property portal Rightmove said. This was the largest month-on-month rise for 20 years, it said. High-end estate agent Savills found buyers could also be affected by the rising cost of living. Spring is traditionally the busiest season for the housing market. Rightmove said high demand among buyers was being driven by those looking for more space and who were ready to move on from their first homes. City property, particularly in London, was more highly sought after than during the pandemic, with some workers being encouraged to return to the office. The increase in demand has pushed the average asking price across Britain to a record £348,804, according to Rightmove. Rental costs jump as workers return to the office\nFirst-time buyers rise: 'I couldn't keep paying rent' This demand for properties was being frustrated, according to Savills, by a lack of homes on the market. Nearly two-thirds (65%) of potential buyers said the lack of available homes was having a severe effect on their ability to buy, according to a survey of people registering with the estate agent earlier this month. Stock shortages appeared to be particularly acutely felt at the top end of the market, with 94% of buyers with a budget of £1m or more reporting a lack of choice. Nearly half (48%) of potential buyers had been considering a move for more than a year, with half (50%) hoping to complete within the next six months. Frances Clacy, research analyst at Savills, said: \"The imbalance of supply and demand, coupled with existing high levels of property wealth, will continue to fuel price growth in the coming months, despite the recent (Bank of England) rate rises.\" But she added that \"realistic pricing\" would become more important as the market felt the knock-on effects of the rising cost of living.

            "header": "McDonald's pig policy fight escalates with board nominations",
            "content": "Billionaire Carl Icahn has stepped up his fight with McDonald's over the welfare of pigs used in its food chain. Mr Icahn, whose no-nonsense reputation for shaking-up companies made him a Wall Street legend, wants to put two people on McDonald's board. He owns only 200 McDonald's shares but, reportedly spurred on by his animal welfare activist daughter, that gives him leverage to agitate for change. McDonald's says it has led the way in improving animal welfare standards. The battle centres on claims about pregnant sows being kept in small crates, a practice Mr Icahn said was \"obscene\". He said McDonald's had not lived up to a promise to phase out the sourcing of pork from pigs housed in so-called gestational crates, a practice targeted by animal rights activists. Mr Icahn had asked all McDonald's pork suppliers in the US to move to \"crate-free pork\", along timeframes he had set. Now Mr Icahn has proposed that Leslie Samuelrich and Maisie Ganzler stand for election at the 2022 annual meeting, a statement by the fast food giant said. Activist investors such as Mr Icahn - one of a handful of feared corporate raiders said to have been the model for Gordon Gekko in the 1987 movie Wall Street - normally focus on companies they believe need restructuring. But he told the Wall Street Journal earlier this month that he was moved to do something at McDonald's by his daughter, an animal lover who has worked for the Humane Society. McDonald's pledged to stop ordering pork from suppliers putting pregnant pigs in crates back in 2012. The firm said it had \"led the industry\" since then and about a third of US pork suppliers have moved to group housing systems. It said it expected to source 85% to 90% of its pork from these suppliers by the year's end. All of the pork it buys will come from these suppliers by 2024. McDonald's said in a statement on Sunday that it would continue to work with the industry to improve standards, but that some of Mr Icahn's demands were unreasonable. McDonald's faces a chip shortage in Japan\nEx-McDonald's boss pays $105m over staff relationships The chain also noted that Mr Icahn was the majority owner of Viskase, which makes and supplies packaging for the pork and poultry industry. It added that he had \"not publicly called\" on Viskase to make similar commitments. Mr Icahn did not immediately respond to a BBC request for comment. As the founder and controlling shareholder of Icahn Enterprises, Mr Icahn has a net worth of $16.8bn (£12.3bn), according to Forbes. He previously spent several months advising former US President Donald Trump on regulatory reform, before stepping down amid controversy. However, he is unlikely to succeed with the nominations, observers said. \"Mr Icahn's profile means McDonald's feels a need to respond even though his stake is so small,\" Mak Yuen Teen, a professor at NUS Business School in Singapore, told the BBC. \"It does seem that McDonald's has been rather slow in fulfilling this particular commitment made 10 years ago. It's only now that it's accelerating the fulfilment when activists are publicly highlighting it.\" McDonald's said it sourced only approximately 1% of US pork production, and that it did not own any sows, or produce or package pork in the country. It said the board would evaluate Mr Icahn's nominees \"as it would any other candidates\". ",

            "header": "Derby County: The footballing city that could lose its club",
            "content": "As those within football work to secure a long-term future for Derby County, which has spent much of the season in administration, businesses in the city and surrounding areas are on tenterhooks. For many, the trade associated with match days represents not just a regular source of income but also the chance to rub shoulders with some of the Rams' passionate supporters. Steve Kirk, the landlord of The Neptune pub, in the city centre, said: \"If Derby is doing well, the town does well.\" He said he makes £80,000 to £100,000 more per year from custom associated with Derby County. Mr Kirk also puts on coaches for fans on away match days, and said this makes another £1,000 to £2,000 from customers drinking at the pub before and after. \"The club is massive for me,\" he said. \"On average, a home match puts an extra £3,000 in turnover. An away game is an extra £1,500 in turnover. \"When the club is doing well, you get better weeks too. It reflects how people spend in town. \"I would just about scrape by if Derby went under but I would take a massive hit. It would put some businesses under.\" Mr Kirk, who has been at the pub for 25 years, added: \"If Derby win, they all come back. If Derby lose, I say to my staff, you may as well go home. \"It would be heartbreaking [if the club went under], not just for the pub but for the whole of Derby.\" He said when Derby is at home \"all the businesses are full\". \"It brings thousands into the town,\" he said. \"You can almost sense the buzz. \"It is incredible what a good football team does for a football town. \"The football club is the heartbeat of the town.\" Ralf Edge and Anna Dyson-Edge run The Alexandra Hotel, near Derby railway station. Mr Edge said: \"We could take the same amount of money in a day as we would in a normal week, if the football is at home.\" Match days, according to Mr Edge, are \"always really busy\". \"It is a great atmosphere. It is quite lively,\" he said. \"There is normally a mixture of home and away fans who get on well.\" He said football was \"people's lives\" in the city. \"It is a big thing for a lot of people having a day out for the football,\" he said. \"For many of our staff, a lot of their hours are football-related. \"There would be fewer staff here if it was not for the football.\" Mrs Dyson-Edge said a precedent for pub closures had already been set in the city when the club moved from its former home, at the Baseball Ground, to Pride Park in 1997. \"A lot of the pubs around the Baseball Ground closed,\" she said. Alan Toop owns CHL catering, which has a burger van outside Pride Park stadium for home fixtures. He said: \"We are all on the edge. \"We all don't know where we stand. The staff need to know where they stand.\" The 47-year-old, who has four vans and also sells food at other events, said: \"What we make through Derby County pays the rent and pays for other jobs. \"I hope it gets resolved.\" Iain Gibson, the landlord of The Three Horseshoes, in Ripley, said losing the club would affect businesses in the county too. He said away fans often stop in Ripley for a couple of hours before heading to Derby. \"One of our best revenues is when we play Sheffield Wednesday or Sheffield United.\" He said Derby County fans will also come in to watch the game on television or have a couple of pints and food before heading to the game and will return afterwards. Mr Gibson said losing the club \"would, without a shadow of a doubt, have a detrimental effect\". He added: \"It is a big institution for Derby. \"If you took away something as big as the football team, it would leave a tremendous void that won't be filled anytime soon.\" David Meredith owns a restaurant called Mezzo, in Pride Park, with his partner Skevy Ioannides. \"We don't even open at the weekends unless there is a match on or an event at Derby Arena,\" he said. \"If the matches were to disappear, that would be a shame. \"It is a nice add-on rather, than essential lifeblood, but we would definitely miss it.\" He added lots of people associated with the club, including players, stopped by the restaurant during the week. Mr Meredith, who is also a season ticket holder, said: \"I have been a supporter of the club since birth and a season ticket holder for 35 years. \"It is very important to me personally. \"I am very keen to see things turn out hopefully for the better.\" Follow BBC East Midlands on Facebook, on Twitter, or on Instagram.

Brian McBride started his business life selling photocopiers for Xerox in the 1970s. He then joined IBM before being hired by Michael Dell to run Dell's operations in UK and Northern Europe. He built his career in digital and tech, first as boss of T-Mobile, where he launched 3G in the UK. He then moved to Amazon as UK chief executive, where he was responsible for building up its UK operations. Mr McBride, who grew up in Glasgow, was a non-executive director of Celtic between 2005 and 2009. Since his retirement, he has undertaken numerous portfolio roles, including chairman of Asos and, most recently, Trainline, as well as being on the board of the BBC. CBI director-general Tony Danker said he was \"hugely excited\" by Mr McBride's nomination. \"His career journey makes him an unmistakably authentic business leader who understands the challenges facing local SMEs and global listed firms alike,\" he said. \"His typical Glaswegian candour combined with his experience in some of the most prestigious boardrooms in the corporate world will prove invaluable to CBI and our members as we work to help them grasp the exciting opportunities in the decade ahead.\" Mr McBride's nomination for the role of president will now go forward for a vote among members at the CBI's AGM on 28 June.

Portugal's navy said no one was hurt by the fire, which broke out on Wednesday, and the 22 crew members were taken to a hotel after the navy, four merchant ships sailing in the area and the Portuguese Air Force completed the evacuation. \"The owner of the ship Felicity Ace is in contact with the logistic agent in order to draw up a plan for the towing of the ship,\" the navy said in a statement. \"So far, no source of pollution has been recorded.\" According to Handelsblatt, an internal email from Volkswagen USA stated that the ship was carrying 3,965 vehicles of the VW, Porsche, Audi and Lamborghini brands. Volkswagen did not confirm the number of cars on board, but Porsche said it had about 1,100 of its models on the ship. The company said it was \"aware of an incident involving a third-party cargo ship transporting Volkswagen Group vehicles across the Atlantic\". Bentley confirmed that 189 of its cars were also onboard the ship. \"We are working with the shipping company to find out further information,\" said a spokesman.

            "content": "Working from home for part of the week has become the norm for some employees, a survey of managers has suggested. More than 80% said their firms had adopted hybrid working - most since the pandemic, a survey for the Chartered Institute of Management (CMI) found. But senior leaders are also actively encouraging employees to return to the workplace, a majority of managers said. The institute said firms should embrace hybrid work as \"best practice\". \"It would be very short sighted of bosses not to see some correlation in the shift in the working world, and the move towards hybrid [working],\" said CMI chief executive Ann Francke. \"We are experiencing an uptick in productivity, and an uptick in many companies results. We're not saying everyone should work from home 100% of the time, we're saying the best practice is to have a blend, so when you come into the office you can do those things that are very difficult to do remotely.\" Should I be working from home now?\nWorking-from-home guidance shift 'may not save my shop' The survey for the professional body, exclusively shared with the BBC, found that 84% of managers said their firms had adopted hybrid working and two-thirds said this had been prompted by the Covid pandemic. Large companies were more likely than small ones to have brought in hybrid working practices, while jobs in factories, transport and trades were less likely to offer the option. The survey found that firms offered staff flexibility to choose which days they came into the office. Work from home guidance in England, which was put in place in December to try to curb the spread of the Omicron variant, was lifted in January. Similar guidance was relaxed in Scotland, but remains in place in Northern Ireland and Wales. As Covid restrictions have eased, commuter numbers have risen. But more than a fifth of train services that were running before the Covid pandemic have not returned. The survey polled 1,237 managers, with 41% working in the private sector, and 59% the public and non-profit sectors. Aoife Fitzmaurice, chief of staff at Sage, which provides accounting, payroll and payment systems, plans to keep hybrid working in place. While there was \"huge demand\" from employees to have the option to work from home, Ms Fitzmaurice said they were also \"missing the human connection\". Ms Fitzmaurice explained that a \"framework of flexibility\" was necessary so that agreements could be made by each team to set the \"sweet spot\" of a combination of home and office work. ",

The falls came after US President Joe Biden accused Russia of looking for excuses for an invasion, which he said could happen in days. In Asia trade on Friday, the Hang Seng in Hong Kong was down by 1.8%, while Japan's Nikkei was 0.4% lower. \"There's a lot of nervousness out there and as we approach the weekend nothing's been settled between Russia and Ukraine,\" Michael James, managing director of equity trading at Wedbush Securities said. \"The continued weakness, especially in the growth names, is indicative of elevated nervousness and sellers continuing to swamp buyers in just about every stock.\" President Joe Biden said on Thursday that military action could begin imminently. Russia called the claims \"baseless\" and accused the US of stoking tensions. Russia seeking excuse to invade Ukraine, US says But uncertainty surrounding the situation, as Ukrainian forces and Russian-backed separatists traded fire in eastern Ukraine, added to investor worries, prompting the sell-off to accelerate in late afternoon trade. Technology and communication firms led the declines, which touched most sectors on the S&P 500 and pushed the Dow to its steepest daily percentage fall since 30 Nov. Oil futures fell more than 2%, and US officials held discussions with Saudi Arabia about a \"collaborative approach\" to managing potential market pressures stemming from a possible Russian invasion of Ukraine, the White House said. The consumer staples sector was one of the few exempt from the declines, lifted by Walmart.

            "content": "The boss of one of Asia's biggest airlines has called on governments in the region to open their borders for the sake of people's livelihoods. \"Politicians have to be brave,\" AirAsia founder Tony Fernandes told the BBC. Cross-border tourism, which accounted for 12% of South East Asia's GDP in 2019, was hit hard by Covid-19 rules. He was speaking at the Singapore Airshow, which returned this week to the city-state after two years of tough travel restrictions. \"It's time to take a deep breath and assess the facts... Having borders closed isn't logical anymore because Omicron is in society,\" the Malaysian low-cost carrier's chief executive said. \"Now we have to protect people's livelihoods and economies,\" he added. Air fare rises are unavoidable, warns airline boss\nWill travel return to normal this summer? Like most airlines around the world, AirAsia reported a massive loss in 2020. But while low-cost international carriers in Europe and North America enjoyed a rebound in 2021 as travel rules were relaxed, Asian airlines slumped even further. Ireland's Ryanair, for example, more than tripled its year-on-year revenue in the third quarter of 2021. In the same period, AirAsia's dropped by a third. According to the International Air Transport Association (IATA), Asia-Pacific was the only region in the world that failed to register any significant improvement in air traffic by the end of 2021. While some Asian countries, such as China and Japan have completely sealed off their borders to outsiders, others like Singapore have made tentative moves into less restrictive travel through selected Vaccinated Travel Lanes (VTLs). It guarantees virtually quarantine-free entry into Singapore, but flights are limited and often more expensive. Other similar schemes in the region - designed to encourage tourism - involve extensive paperwork as well as multiple costly Covid tests and short periods of compulsory isolation. \"To me, opening our borders means no quarantine, no form-filling, no constant testing,\" Mr Fernandes said. \"It's time to move on and get on with our lives,\" he added. In spite of the continued restrictions, the return of the Singapore Airshow was hailed by many as a sign of confidence in the region's aviation industry. All of the world's biggest aerospace players were in attendance and most were cautiously optimistic that 2022 will be a better year for Asia. \"We let governments here take the lead and we follow their pace\", said Ted Colbert, the US-based chief executive of Boeing Global Services. \"But we're prepared for a comeback and we're excited about that happening.\" \"We're expecting inter-regional travel to come back soon and for the full market to return to normal by 2023 or 2024,\" he added. But regional industry experts say a lot more needs to be done to ensure the industry's full recovery in the short-term, especially when it comes to building a more cohesive travel policy between governments. \"Each country in Asia sets its own rules, often fast-changing rules, which makes it risky and complicated for travellers,\" Henk Ombelet from aviation analysts Cirium said. \"So it ends up that most opt to just not travel, or at most just travel domestically.\" The uncertainty surrounding snap restrictions, or potential new virus variants, means that passenger services have become a less reliable source of income for companies in the long-term. Mr Colbert highlights Boeing's increasing focus on air cargo, something that has been accelerated by high shipping costs and which he says is forecast to grow by 70% by 2040. Meanwhile, AirAsia moved into new businesses, including food delivery, digital banking and e-commerce, while many of its planes remained grounded. To reflect this change the airline's parent company last month changed its name from AirAsia Group to Capital A. But Mr Fernandes denies the shift into different areas shows a lack of confidence in AirAsia's core business. \"People will always need to fly.

            "content": "The minister for Brexit opportunities has urged firms struggling with red tape to write to him, while on a visit to the UK's biggest container port. Jacob Rees-Mogg said Brexit was \"already a success\" and that he would be working to \"cut through the thicket\" of red tape. Mr Rees-Mogg who was visiting the Port of Felixstowe, was given the new role in the PM's recent cabinet re-shuffle. But Suffolk's chamber of commerce said paperwork was hindering trade. Koyas Miah of the Suffolk Chamber of Commerce said many members had seen a rise in the costs of administration, and rules being interpreted differently by different EU countries was not helping. \"The paperwork, understanding what they (firms) need to do, how they need to do it is becoming a challenge,\" said Mr Miah. \"What businesses are now facing is one EU country saying they want XYZ for paperwork, but the other (EU country) wants something completely different,\" said Mr Miah. He said the chamber has heard from businesses that have stopped trading with EU countries for now because of problems with compliance. He has called for the Brexit minister to bring more clarity \"in terms of what needs to be done\". Mr Rees-Mogg promised he would be tackling the issues of compliance. \"We don't want to replace a European bureaucracy with a home-grown bureaucracy,\" he said. \"My role is to try and cut through this thicket. My role as the Brexit opportunities minister is to find out where regulations exist that we don't need, and to try and get rid of them.\" UK exports to the EU fell by 14% between 2019 and 2020, while imports fell by 19%, according to the House of Commons library data. Last week, a cross-party committee of MPs - the Public Accounts Committee - said that new arrangements for the UK-EU border had added costs to businesses exporting to Europe. Mr Rees-Mogg cited the pandemic and general disruption to global trade, such as containers stuck in world ports, as some of the reasons behind the drop in trade, rather than leaving the EU. \"I think Brexit has been extremely beneficial for the country, I think the evidence that Brexit has caused trade drops is few and far between,\" he said.

            "content": "KitKat and Nescafe-maker Nestle has warned it will increase the prices of its products due to the growing cost of producing its goods. Mark Schneider, boss of the food group, said it was \"safe assumption\" that prices would rise this year. He said there was \"no place\" in the company that was \"exempt of inflation\". Reckitt Benckiser, the consumer goods company behind Durex and Dettol, also said prices would rise, but added it hoped to absorb most of the increases. Reckitt's costs rose 11% in 2021, but chief executive Laxman Narasimhan said that wouldn't mean prices rising by that amount, as the company had ways to \"mitigate and manage pricing\" \"We care about the competitiveness of our brands,\" he told a conference call. Jeff Carr, chief financial officer, said the firm's costs had increased \"across the board\", ranging from crude oil and plastic, to shipping and wages. But he said that company was \"absorbing a significant part\" of higher operating costs through \"efficiency\" and \"better buying\". \"We are not passing it on to consumers,\" he said. \"We are passing some pricing onto consumers but we minimise that through the programmes we have…to absorb those cost increases.\" Shares rose in the company by as much as 5.4% on Thursday. Living costs at 30-year high as households squeezed Meanwhile, Nestle said it had already lifted prices by 3.1% in the fourth quarter of its financial to offset rising operating costs. \"It is a safe assumption that our input cost increases for 2022 will be higher than 2021, that is something that we have to reflect in our pricing,\" said Mr Schneider \"There is almost no place in the company that is exempt of inflation now,\" he added. \"Some of these things you can hedge against, some not.\" Consumer goods companies have previously warned of price rises for products due the rising costs of raw materials, energy and labour. It will raise pressure on households who are facing a cost of living crisis. Recent data showed that inflation hit a 30-year high of 5.5% in the year to January and the Bank of England forecasts that the cost of living could reach over 7% by spring - far above its 2% inflation target. Gas and electricity costs are set to rise in April when the new, higher energy price cap is introduced. At the same time companies, their staff and the self-employed will pay 1.25p more in the pound for National Insurance. Danni Hewson, financial analyst at AJ Bell, said big brand owners were facing an \"important test given pressures on the cost of living\". \"Consumers may not be able to keep stomaching price increases and so there is a risk they buy less of the popular and more expensive brands and/or trade down to cheaper options,\" she added. \"The big brand companies therefore face the risk of having to cut their prices just to maintain sales volumes.\" Nestle, which also makes Cheerios and Smarties, revealed total sales increased by 3.3% to SwFr87.1bn (£69.5bn) last year. The firm's net profit grew by 38.2% to SwFr16.9bn. It said sales had been driven by strong demand for coffee, pet products and health foods during the pandemic. Meanwhile, Reckitt said its full-year sales had increased by 3.5%, ahead of expectations, on demand for hygiene and health products. Splitting its divisions, hygiene performed best with sales up 1.6% in the year to £5.9 billion, including strong sales of Air Wick, Lysol, Finish and Vanish. Sales of Durex condoms, KY lubricants and Veet hair removal products were boosted as lockdowns were lifted. The firm added sales of US cleaning and disinfecting spray Lysol were about 90% higher than 2019. It said it expected its health business to benefit from stronger cold and flu treatment sales. Last week, Unilever, the firm behind brands such as Marmite and Dove Soap, said it would put up its prices again this year as its overheads continue to rise. The company, which also makes Ben & Jerry's ice cream and Hellmann's mayonnaise, said it was facing €3.5bn (£2.95bn) of extra costs in 2022 alone. ",

            "content": "More than a fifth of train services that were running before the Covid pandemic have not returned, new data provided to the BBC shows. One month after work-from-home guidance was lifted, some commuters say they are struggling to get to work amid a lack of trains and sudden cancellations. Train operating companies said they are starting to bring back more services. But rail minister Wendy Morton could not guarantee that services would return to pre-pandemic levels. The government says it has spent more than £14bn propping up the railways after passenger numbers, and ticket revenue, collapsed during the Covid pandemic. Omicron dealt passenger numbers a fresh setback at the end of 2021, as people were again asked to work from home if they could. Timetables across the country were cut back again over the winter which train companies blamed on high levels of staff isolation. The Rail Delivery Group, which represents operators, says 19,500 trains are now running per day, which is equivalent to 79% of overall pre-Covid services. It says that is expected to rise to 85% by the end of the month. The shape of the timetable beyond that is still uncertain. As commuters slowly return, deciding how many services to are needed at which times is a challenge. The industry group points out that current passenger demand is still below the capacity available. The latest figures from the Department for Transport show that on Monday this week, passenger usage was about 64% of pre-pandemic levels. Leisure travel has recovered better than weekdays. The rail industry has launched a rewards programme to incentivise commuters, and a flexible season ticket has been introduced in an attempt to adapt to changed habits. But Lee Garrett and Amy Kean say the current level of rail service is putting them off returning to regular train trips into the office. They say arriving on time is proving challenging. The couple live in Gipsy Hill, close to Crystal Palace, and commute into Central London, but many of the services they used before the pandemic have been cut. Lee said: \"There's only one train every half an hour at the moment. \"Yesterday was the perfect example. I turn up to get the one that would have got me to work on time and it's cancelled, so I am down to one an hour. \"So I have to change my plan, turn round, and work from home.\" This week, that isn't too much of a problem as Lee doesn't have to be in the office. \"At the moment it is voluntary. Next week when it is mandatory it is going to be a problem\" Lee said. He is hoping that more services are soon added. For his wife Amy, getting to the office on time on her mandated days is already proving difficult. \"I have people in my team from Kent and Essex and I'd say at least 25% are having problems every day. \"There are fewer trains an hour, they are very crowded, and they are randomly being cancelled. They are not as frequent or reliable.\" Recently appointed rail minister Wendy Morton said people were now working differently in a \"changing landscape\" with people \"starting to blend home and the office\". She said it was necessary to \"balance the mix\". Ms Morton could not confirm that services would ever return to levels before March 2020, and said the government is \"reviewing and monitoring the trains and levels of passengers. \"We are not where we were previously,\" she said. Pointing to more than £14bn of taxpayer funding used to keep the railways going, any decisions would need to be \"fair for passengers and fair to taxpayers as well,\" she added. Rail industry insiders say that day-to-day Covid infections are still affecting their ability to run all timetabled services, with staff still off, and train operating crews short of people. They also point to interruption in driver training. Some operators have bid to run more services that would bring them close to pre-Covid levels, but a final decision is still to be made on that. While passenger numbers on trains and buses are still lower than they were, road traffic has rebounded, with car journeys approaching pre-pandemic levels. Business groups say train services need to be running to help local economies, but also to help cut pollution from car journeys. Raj Kandola, from the Greater Birmingham Chambers of Commerce said: \"We need an appropriate level of service to get people back to the office. \"To make sure they are frequenting the city centre and using leisure services. \"At the same time, we need to get people get out of their cars if we are going to reduce the amount of congestion on our polluted road networks.\" Businesses who traditionally depend on rail trade are also hoping that services and commuters return. Peter Collie owns the Horseshoe Inn near London Bridge railway station, and the Prince of Wales pub a stone's throw from Paddington station. Trade has been 80% down during the pandemic, with the Paddington site the worst hit. \"We've lost probably 50% of the staff we had back in 2019,\" he says. \"We've had to cut back on everything that we wanted to do.\" But he believes career opportunities and social benefits will eventually tempt commuters back. \"Being optimistic, we'll hopefully be back to firing on full cylinders within two years,\" he says. And some businesses say that people are now prepared to spend more money when they visit city centres, because they are only commuting two or three days per week. ",

Under the deal, the firm will back a new entity which owns the legendary team's commercial rights. Initially, Silver Lake will invest NZ$200m (£98.4m; $133.6m) in exchange for a stake of up to 8.58%. New Zealand Rugby and the New Zealand Rugby Players Association say they plan to \"invest in the game at all levels\". The agreement came after months of often heated negotiations. Players blocked previous attempts for private ownership of the All Blacks brand, which has always been publicly owned. The deal has now been made possible by the backing of the powerful rugby players' association. \"I want to acknowledge that the journey to get here hasn't been easy at times. There was healthy debate and some adjustments by all parties, but always with the good of the game at the heart of this process,\" Stewart Mitchell, chairman of New Zealand Rugby (NZR) said in a statement. \"This is a pivotal moment for rugby in New Zealand,\" David Kirk, the former All Black captain and chairman of the New Zealand Rugby Players Association said. The statement also said that under the new agreement, NZR will \"retain full control over rugby as well as the commercial strategy\", with Silver Lake remaining a minority investor. The deal values NZR CommercialCo, the new holding company for the revenue of All Blacks and other New Zealand rugby associations, at NZ$3.5bn. Later this year, New Zealand-based institutional investors will be given the opportunity to take part in the sale of a stake in NZR CommercialCo of up to NZ$100m.

            "content": "A review will be held into whether minimum wage age bands on the Isle of Man are \"appropriate\", the enterprise minister has said. The payment is set to rise by £1.25 to £9.50 an hour from April after Tynwald backed the first increase since 2019. Development workers and 16 to 17-year-olds will also see pay go up to £8.05 and £6.80 respectively. Alex Allinson said those bands would be looked at as part of plans to adopt the Living Wage by April 2025. That rate, which is currently calculated to be £10.87 per hour, is an estimate of the minimum level of pay needed to allow people the basic opportunities and choices necessary to participate in society. The Minimum Wage Committee's recommendations were approved by Tynwald on Tuesday, but some politicians raised concerns the separate age-based rates were unfair. Health minister and Liberal Vannin Party Leader Lawrie Hooper said they were \"inappropriate\", and the assumption that age equates to experience was \"fundamentally flawed\". \"An employee that has been with you for two years aged 16-17 clearly has more experience than a brand new employee aged 18,\" he added. Dr Allinson said he was aware of the concerns and promised they would be looked at as part of broader efforts to align the minimum and living wages. The \"arbitrary deviations are becoming less and less relevant\" as the island moves to a \"knowledge and skills based economy\", he said. He added: \"The age of a new employee tends to be irrelevant, it is their skills, experience and their ability to do the job which is important, and that should be rewarded by decent pay.\" Why not follow BBC Isle of Man on Facebook and Twitter?

The firm, which sells brand including Strongbow cider, Amstel and Europe's best-selling lager, Heineken, blamed soaring ingredient and energy costs. It comes after the founder of Cobra beer also said its prices will rise because of \"vicious\" cost pressures. Neither firm has said how much their prices will go up by. Heineken's chief executive Dolf van den Brink said: \"These kind of price increases and inflation, I think we have not seen in a generation.\" He added that putting up prices could lead to \"softer beer consumption\" as drinkers reined in their spending due to soaring living costs. Beer prices will have to rise, says Cobra founder\nWhy are prices rising so quickly?\nLiving costs at 30-year high as households squeezed Inflation in the UK hit a new 30-year high in January as energy prices, fuel and food costs continued to rise. The cost of living is now rising faster than wages and is expected to climb above 7% this year. Marmite-maker Unilever, the bakers Greggs and sandwich chain Pret a Manger have all warned on price rises as their costs rises. Heineken said its input costs were now set to rise by a mid-teens percentage due to the price of barley doubling compared to a year ago and aluminium prices going up by around 50%. Transport and energy costs have also risen for the business. It comes after a strong year for the Dutch brewer, when consumers splashed out on alcohol during the pandemic. Heineken said that its net revenues increased by 11.3% to 21.9 billion euros (£13.4 billion) in 2021, with sales of its Heineken-branded beer up by 17.4%. The brewer's profits rose by 80%, although it said the coming year remained \"uncertain\" due to \"inflationary challenges\". Huw Dixon, Professor of Economics at Cardiff University and the National Institute of Economic and Social Research, questioned the brewer's decision to put up prices. \"Heineken's strong sales seem to indicate that their profit margins aren't being squeezed even though there might be certain costs that are rising,\" he told the BBC. \"It's very hard for us as experts to say whether Heineken's increased production costs are wholly reflected in higher prices for customers.\" ",

Mike White, who has been with the firm for more than 10 years, will oversee a team that includes senior leaders. In a memo to staff, which has been seen by the BBC, chief executive Bob Chapek said the metaverse is \"the next great storytelling frontier\" to be explored. Technology giants, including Facebook owner Meta and Microsoft, are pouring billions of dollars into the metaverse. In the memo, Mr Chapek described the metaverse as a \"perfect place to pursue our strategic pillars of storytelling excellence, innovation, and audience focus\". \"Teams across the company are exploring this new canvas, and I have been blown away by what I've seen,\" he said. Is this the world's largest virtual fashion show?\nApparently, it's the next big thing. What is the metaverse? Mr White will become Disney's senior vice president for Next Generation Storytelling and Consumer Experiences. In the newly-created role he will allocate resources, explore partnerships and encourage knowledge sharing on the metaverse, the company said. He will also lead a team with skills including technology, strategy and storytelling. Disney said it sees the metaverse as the next evolution of its almost 100-year-old storytelling tradition. \"Today, we have an opportunity to connect those universes and create an entirely new paradigm for how audiences experience and engage with our stories,\" Mr Chapek said in the memo. Last week, Disney said sales at its theme parks in the US had climbed above pre-pandemic levels. It also announced that its Disney+ streaming service had added 11.8 million subscribers in the last three months of 2021, taking the total to almost 130 million worldwide. A metaverse is an online world where people can game, work and communicate in a virtual environment, often using VR headsets. It is being touted by some of the world's biggest technology companies as a key development in the next generation of the internet. The company formerly known as Facebook has made the biggest bet so far on the metaverse. Last year, Facebook changed its corporate name to Meta Platforms and said it planned to spend more than $10bn (£7.4bn) to develop virtual reality software and hardware.

            "header": "Car industry calls for electric charge watchdog",
            "content": "The UK car industry has called for a watchdog to oversee electric car charging prices and the availability of charge points. The growth in electric vehicles sales is outstripping the rollout of charging points, the Society of Motor Manufacturers and Traders (SMMT) said. It said a regulator is needed to monitor the market. The government said it was providing £1.3bn to expand the charging network. Over the decade between 2011 and 2021 the number of charge points in the UK jumped from about 1,500 to more than 48,000, according to industry figures. But between 2019 and 2021 the number of electric cars on the road increased much faster than charge points were being rolled out. Moreover, the charge point rollout was uneven, going faster in the south of England than in the north, the industry body said. The SMMT called on the government to set up a new regulator called \"Ofcharge\" - the Office of Charging - to monitor the market. Public charging points \"remain critical to consumer confidence and are still relied upon by many commercial fleets, as well as the third of British households that do not have designated off-street parking,\" the SMMT added. Electric vehicles are seen as a way to cut greenhouse gas emissions from transport, which became the largest emitting sector in the UK in 2016. But while there is soaring interest in electric cars, this hasn't yet translated into vehicles on the road. In 2020, the number of battery electric cars on the road increased by 114% to a record high of just under 200,000, while the number of plug-in hybrids jumped 35% to just under 240,000. There has also been a sharp increase in interest in second-hand electric cars. However, electric cars remain a tiny fraction of the cars on UK roads, representing just 1.3% of the total. Businesses have been leading the way with fleet purchases, but the car industry is pushing for consumers to buy into electric cars too. However, many people have concerns about electric cars, with two of the main ones being the cost of buying a car, and whether there are enough charge points, including for longer journeys, the car industry says. Last summer MPs also raised concerns about the cost of public charging, saying it was far more expensive than charging a car at home. Energy prices have soared since then. Electric car charging prices 'must be fair' say MPs Mike Hawes, SMMT chief executive, called for \"clear targets\" and more government support for rolling out charge points. A Department for Transport spokesperson said the government was providing more than £1.3bn \"to support the continued roll-out of charge points at homes, businesses and on residential streets across the UK, levelling up our charge point provision while supporting the deployment of rapid charge points on motorways and major A roads in England\". The government will publish its electric vehicle infrastructure plan soon, the spokesperson said, adding: \"We continue to work with local authorities to ensure they are engaged in the transition, and are encouraging them to make use of the on-street residential charge point scheme which last year committed £20m for the rollout of public charge points in residential areas.\" ",

            "content": "US prosecutors allege a former Goldman Sachs banker siphoned off millions of dollars from Malaysia's scandal-hit 1MDB sovereign wealth fund. Roger Ng, who was Goldman's head of investment banking in Malaysia, is charged with conspiring to launder money and violate anti-bribery law. The trial got underway in Brooklyn, New York on Monday after Mr Ng previously pleaded not guilty to all charges. 1MDB lost billions of dollars in one of the world's biggest financial scandals. If found guilty, Mr Ng faces up to 20 years in jail for the money laundering charge and five years for each of the two bribery charges. \"The defendant saw an opportunity to make millions of dollars by cheating, and he took it,\" Brent Wible, a lawyer for the US Department of Justice said as the trial opened on Monday. Mr Wible said Mr Ng conspired with two people - his former boss Timothy Leissner and Chinese-Malaysian financier Jho Low - to embezzle funds from 1MDB. They allegedly used some of the stolen money to bribe Malaysian officials to get more business for Goldman Sachs. The prosecutor said Mr Ng received $35m (£25.9m) from Mr Leissner for his role in the alleged scheme. Banker and rapper face Trump-related probe charge\nBank boss gets $10m pay cut for Malaysia scandal However, defence lawyer Marc Agnifilo said his client was not involved in the scheme. Mr Agnifilo said the money was meant for Mr Ng's wife, who had started a business venture with Mr Leissner's ex-wife. \"They're not partners-in-crime. There's a gulf between these two men a mile wide. He's trying to use my client to... serve his jail time,\" Mr Agnifilo said of Mr Leissner, who is expected to testify against Mr Ng. The case centres on Wall Street investment banking giant Goldman Sachs, which helped to raise $6.5bn for 1MDB through bond sales to investors. Investigators found that the proceeds from the bonds, sold from 2009 to 2014, were largely stolen. Goldman Sachs spent years being investigated by regulators across the world, including in the US, UK, Singapore, Malaysia and Hong Kong. In 2020, Goldman Sachs reached a $3.9bn settlement with the Malaysian government for its role in the multi-billion-dollar corruption scheme. It also paid nearly $3bn to authorities in four countries to end an investigation into work it performed for 1MDB. The same year, Malaysia's former Prime Minister Najib Razak was sentenced to 12 years in jail after he was found guilty of abusing his power, laundering money and breaching the public's trust. ",

            "header": "The tricks scammers use to steal your money",
            "content": "Criminals are deploying \"psychological tactics\" to con people out of cash amid a rise in scams, Barclays bank says. The tricks include creating illusions of product scarcity or pretending to be an authority to \"socially engineer\" victims, the bank's chief behavioural scientist Dr Pete Brooks warned. He said scammers used dating apps to target people over weeks in some cases to establish \"emotional connections\". Dr Brooks added they preyed on people's biases and personality traits. He told the BBC although the types of scams hadn't changed over decades, criminals were becoming more sophisticated and could use \"many more channels\" to target people. Using dating apps as an example, Dr Brooks said scammers would connect with people they matched with, develop a relationship over time, and then exploit people's personality traits to get them to transfer them money. \"Most of us by default are trusting,\" said Dr Brooks. Dr Brooks said so-called \"purchase scams\", where goods bought online don't exist or never arrive, were the most common type. He said such crimes involved fraudsters creating a \"perceived scarcity and therefore 'value' in what they are selling to motivate consumers to act quickly and not rely on their better judgment\". This might be advertising something as a one-time offer, he added, or a product with a limited-edition price or availability, or \"rushing us into buying something that 'has' to be bought now - even if you've never seen the product in real life\". Barclays said the average amount a person loses through purchase scams totalled £980; however, research found scams targeting people investing led to the most money being lost. Figures showed a 17% rise in all reported scams in the last three months, while attempts at conning people increased by 70% in the final three months of 2021. Impersonation scams, Dr Brooks said, involved criminals exploiting a trait found in more than two-thirds of Brits surveyed, as being more likely to comply with a request if they believed it to be from a well-known institution, such as a bank, the police or the NHS. \"In these situations, scammers will harness that sense of authority to instil fear in their victims,\" he said. \"Perhaps suggesting their bank account has been compromised, they are overdue a payment or that they will be fined if they do not pay the full amount. Psychologically, many of us will take these at face-value if they're coming from what we believe to be a reputable institution.\" Fraudsters steal £4m a day as crime surges\n'We lost nearly £10k to TV licence scammers' Meanwhile, investment scams, Barclays said, saw a victim lose on average £15,788 the last three months of 2021. Dr Brooks said scammers were \"experts at exploiting the fact people want to grow their assets, and that we can sometimes put our better judgement aside for a high return opportunity\". Barclays said that was reflected in its research, with three in 10 people admitting they would be willing to go with an investment or savings provider they'd never heard of if they thought the returns would be higher than their existing provider. Barclays said real phone calls from a bank will never ask customers to share their pin number or security information or to transfer money to a \"safe account\". The bank said its advice was \"always to question whether something appears too good to be true, and not to be afraid to be suspicious\". But it warned \"worryingly\", almost a third of 2,002 people it polled admitted they \"wouldn't know what to do if they found themselves being targeted\".

            "header": "Petrol and diesel prices reach new record high",
            "content": "Fuel prices have hit a new record high at the pump across the UK, tightening the squeeze on UK consumers, the motoring organisation the AA has said. Over the weekend petrol reached 148.02p a litre, while diesel hit a new record high of 151.57p a litre last Thursday. Fuel previously hit a record in November, before wholesale and retail prices fell back. \"The cost of living crisis has been ratcheted up yet another notch,\" said Luke Bosdet of the AA. The RAC's fuel spokesman Simon Williams said the price of filling a 55-litre family car was now an \"eye-watering\" £81.41. \"With the oil price teetering on the brink of $100 a barrel and retailers keen to pass on the increase in wholesale fuel quickly, new records could now be set on a daily basis in the coming weeks,\" he said. Surging food prices push inflation to 30-year high\nWhat is the UK's inflation rate and why is the cost of living going up?\nAre we paying too much at the pump? Fuel prices at the pump are driven largely by the wholesale price of energy which has shot up due to tensions over whether Russia will invade Ukraine. On Monday, oil prices hit their highest level since 2014, reaching $95.56 a barrel. If the situation in Ukraine deteriorates, oil and gas supplies from Russia to Europe may be interrupted, pushing up wholesale prices further. The supply of oil and gas has already struggled to keep up with growing demand as the global economy picked up in recent months as Covid restrictions eased. The RAC's Mr Williams said: \"On a positive note, retailer margins - which were the reason drivers paid overly high prices in December and January - have now returned to more normal levels of around 7p a litre.\" He said the big four supermarkets, which dominate fuel sales, should \"play fair\" with drivers by keeping their profit margins low. Day-to-day prices for food, household bills and other items such as used cars, have risen sharply in recent months, in part due to rising energy prices. The Petrol Retailers' Association (PRA), which represents independent retailers, said it would continue to ensure that the price of fuel was \"as competitive as possible\". But tensions between Russia and Ukraine, as well as other key factors such as tightness in the oil market and the dollar-sterling exchange rate, were likely to cause further volatility in the oil price, said Gordon Balmer, PRA's executive director. UK inflation is now at a 30-year high of 5.4%. New inflation figures for January will be released by the Office for National Statistics on Wednesday. Mr Bosdet said the AA had surveyed 15,000 of its members after prices spiked at the end of last year and found higher fuel prices were leading 43% of them to cut back on the amount they used their car as well as other areas of spending. Mike Johnson at the energy consultancy Portland Analytics said what happens to energy prices next depended both on the situation in Ukraine and whether the Organisation of Petrol Exporting Countries (Opec) was able to boost supply. \"Opec and its allies have struggled to increase production in line with their output targets due to a combination of production outages and technical issues, whilst demand continues to rise,\" he said. While oil producing nations had agreed to increase production by 400,000 barrels per day in February Mr Johnson said it seemed unlikely that target would be met. ",

The Everyman Cinema group has submitted a proposal to convert part of the basement of the former department store in Bury St Edmunds, Suffolk. The developer said a cinema would \"promote the vitality\" of the town, which already has two cinemas. Debenhams had been the \"anchor\" store of the Arc shopping centre before it closed in May 2021, along with 123 others across the country.

It added: \"It will make effective use of previously developed land within Bury St Edmunds' town centre.\" Everyman Group currently owns 36 cinemas, but in its application it said it was looking for opportunities to grow that number, the Local Democracy Reporting Service said. The Debenhams was built as the flagship store when the Arc opened in 2009 on the former cattle market site. Any cinema would be in addition to the town's Abbeygate Picturehouse on Hatter Street, which opened as The Central in 1923, and the Cineworld multiplex which opened on Parkway in 2005.

            "content": "The Post Office scandal that saw sub-postmasters wrongly convicted for fraud has ruined lives, a top lawyer has said. Barrister Jason Beer QC said former sub-postmasters and mistresses' stories should be at the heart of an inquiry. \"Lives were ruined, families torn apart, families were made homeless or destitute,\" he said. The cases constitute the most widespread miscarriage of justice in British legal history. Between 2000 and 2014, more than 700 sub-postmasters were wrongly accused of theft, fraud and false accounting due to a flaw in the Horizon accounting IT system. The inquiry - which is expected to run for the rest of this year - will look at whether the Post Office knew about faults in the IT system and will also ask how staff shouldered the blame. A total of 72 former sub-postmasters have had their names cleared so far. In his opening remarks, Sir Wyn Williams, the retired High Court judge who is leading the inquiry, expressed thanks to the 50 to 60 witnesses he expects to hear oral evidence from in the coming weeks. Sir Wyn said he sought to understand \"the scale and nature of the harm\" done to so many. \"These hearings would not be taking place at all were it not for the witnesses who have agreed to give up their valuable time to publicly relive what must be very distressing memories and events.\" Baljit Sethi was the first witness to give evidence on Monday. He had told the BBC beforehand he was looking forward to it. During his session, he described his long career spanning two decades, during which he ran two branches near Romford in Essex with his wife Anjana successfully using paper accounts. After Horizon was introduced, one branch had no problems at all, but the second one showed a hole in the accounts of £17,000, which they were asked to cover out of their own pocket. The Sethis were never charged, but still faced a financial and emotional nightmare. Why were hundreds of sub-postmasters prosecuted?\n'I want someone else jailed like I was'\nListen: The Great Post Office Trial Mr Sethi said he tried to communicate with the head office in Chelmsford, Essex, after noticing a problem with the system. He broke down in tears and went on to say: \"I was the only man who ran the Post Office seven days a week. \"I used to open it at 8am and shut at 8pm. I was the only Post Office in the country running all seven days. \"I knew there was something wrong with the system but no-one wanted to know that,\" he added. \"We didn't take a single penny from the Post Office our entire life.\" Mr Sethi has also told the BBC previously that the scandal meant he felt he was unable to be a good parent to his two sons and daughter. His son Amit said ahead of the session: \"I want accountability and those who suffered should be compensated appropriately. \"That's it - then we'll draw a line under it.\" The judge will hear evidence on why sub-postmasters and postmistresses were singled out and whether they have been justly compensated, as well as analysing at least 100 written statements. Mr Beer, the counsel to the inquiry, pointed out that some former sub-postmasters had passed away before it started. \"It is about people whose mental and physical health has been impacted, people whose marriages and partnerships have deteriorated or failed, about people who have thought about taking their own lives and in some cases took their own lives,\" he said. The inquiry will also examine whether staff at software firm Fujitsu, which developed the Horizon software to complete tasks such as transactions, accounting and stocktaking, knew the system had flaws while data from it was used in court to convict sub-postmasters. Evidence will be heard from witnesses in Leeds and Cardiff over the coming weeks. \"I cannot stress enough the importance of me understanding the scale and nature of the harm which has bee caused to so many individuals,\" Sir Wyn said.

            "content": "Ukraine is taking moves to keep its airspace open after KLM became the first major airline to suspend flights to the capital Kyiv. It comes as tensions over Russia's military build-up on Ukraine's border intensify despite diplomatic efforts to ease the situation. Ukraine said it was ready to assume financial obligations for flight safety in the country's airspace. Other airlines could follow KLM because of the rising insurance costs. Ukraine's deputy head of the office of the president, Kirill Tymoshenko, said at the weekend that the country was willing to underwrite some of the costs. He wrote in a Facebook post: \"Ukraine is ready to make financial commitments for the safety of aircraft in the Ukrainian sky. \"To ensure flight safety, the government today decided to allocate funds from the State Budget Reserve Fund to the Infrastructure Ministry. Guarantees will be provided for insurance companies, reinsurance companies, leasing companies and airlines.\" Reports said the money allocated was about 16.6bn hryvnyas (£404m). The travel industry is still haunted by the memory of Malaysia Airlines flight MH17, which was shot down while flying near eastern Ukraine's conflict zone in July 2014. All 298 passengers and crew on board the Amsterdam-Kuala Lumpur flight were killed. On Sunday, Ukraine's budget airline SkyUp said its flight from Portugal to Kyiv was forced to land in Moldova on Sunday after the plane's Irish leasing company revoked permission for it to cross into Ukraine. SkyUp said European leasing companies were demanding that Ukrainian airlines return their planes to EU airspace within 48 hours. Ukraine seeks meeting with Russia within 48 hours\nA dozen nations tell citizens: leave Ukraine now The BBC understands that British Airways, which has not operated flights to Ukraine for several years, is not using Ukrainian airspace. It is unclear how long this policy has been in place. A BA pilot said on Twitter over the weekend that there was a long flight time for a freighter service from London to Bangkok because of \"current geo-politics\". Germany's Lufthansa said it was considering a suspension of flights to Ukraine. However, Wizz Air said: \"Currently, we have not made any changes to our schedule and all of our flights to/from Ukraine continue to operate as normal. \"All passengers with booked flights to and from Ukraine are advised to regularly check their mailboxes for further information about booked flights.\" The airline said it was closely monitoring the situation. Data from the global tracking service FlightRadar24 shows the airspace over northern Turkey, on the other side of the Black Sea from Ukraine, is particularly busy. Airspace in Russia just over its eastern border with Ukraine is also busy. But there are relatively few planes over Ukraine itself, the analysis suggests. Reuters reported that an adviser to Ukraine's president said that, regardless of what airlines chose to do, Kyiv would not close its airspace as that would resemble \"a kind of partial blockade\". Mark Zee, founder of flight operations advisory firm OPSGROUP, told Reuters: \"My guess would be that Ukraine will become unavailable pretty soon if what we've seen over the weekend crystallises into a couple of more carriers actually pulling the pin. \"I don't think it will be government advice that's doing it so much as it will be insurance-based unavailability or carriers looking at other carriers.\" Concerns about rising tensions over Ukraine cast a shadow over European stock markets on Monday. Shares in British Airways owner IAG, Wizz Air and travel group Tui fell about 6.5%. In morning trading the main stock markets in Paris and Germany were down more than 3%, while London's FTSE 100 share index fell 2%. More than a dozen countries have urged their citizens to leave Ukraine amid warnings from Western powers that an invasion by Russia could be imminent. The US, UK and Germany are among those who have told their nationals to leave. Moscow has amassed an estimated 100,000 troops along Ukraine's border but denies any intent to invade. ",

Many have described being shunned by their communities while some have since died. The Post Office has said it is \"sincerely sorry\" for the impact of the Horizon scandal, adding it is \"in no doubt about the human cost\". It said the inquiry would enable \"many of those who were most deeply affected by Post Office's past failings to voice their experiences and their testimonies must and will ensure all lessons are learned so that such events can never happen again\". \"In addressing the past, our first priority is that full, fair and final compensation is provided and we are making good progress,\" it added. The government has set aside funding to facilitate compensation payments.

            "content": "The cost of air travel is set to rise this year as airlines face soaring overheads, the UK boss of Air France-KLM has told the BBC. Fahmi Mahjoub said his airline faced significantly higher fuel and airport costs, and as a result higher air fares were \"quite unavoidable\". The airline advised people in the UK to book early as travel rules were eased and demand picked up. It said it was already seeing strong demand for Easter and summer. Mr Mahjoub told the BBC's Today programme: \"The increase in cost of living is a very concrete issue for many households but also the airline industry. \"So I think there is an expectation that airline tickets could become more costly as we move forward and I think the advice we have for customers is simply to plan earlier to be able to avoid those prices increases.\" On Monday, oil prices hit their highest level since 2014 on fears that a possible invasion of Ukraine by Russia could drive up costs in an already tight market. A barrel of benchmark Brent Crude reached $95.56 (£70.13) - up from under $65 a year ago. The rising price of oil has affected everything from heating bills to petrol prices, and Mr Mahjoub said the cost of jet fuel was also going up sharply. On top of this, Air France-KLM now has to pay 40% more to fly in and out of Heathrow airport, he said. Spain relaxes Covid restrictions for UK teenagers\nRyanair: Holiday prices likely to rise sharply soon It is not the first travel firm to warn on prices. Last year, airline Ryanair and tour operator TUI both predicted holiday costs would be higher than in 2019 as the pandemic eased and demand rebounded. Despite the challenges, Air France-KLM says bookings from the UK have jumped since pre-departure and Day 2 Covid tests were scrapped for vaccinated travellers. Mr Mahjoub said bookings for winter sun destinations such as Dubai, the US and Thailand had been strong. Demand for half-term, Easter and summer flights was also healthy. Air France acquired the Dutch airline KLM to create Air France-KLM Group in 2004, one of the largest air carriers in the world. The deal allows the two airlines to operate as separate companies. On Sunday, KLM said it would stop services to Ukraine amid concerns Russia is preparing to invade. Germany's Lufthansa is also considering suspending flights. ",

            "header": "India bourse head was a 'puppet' of unnamed yogi, regulators say",
            "content": "The former chief executive of India's largest bourse made crucial decisions by consulting and sending confidential information to a yogi, regulators say. Chitra Ramkrishna sought advice from a spiritual guru in the Himalayas while head of the National Stock Exchange (NSE), the Securities and Exchange Board of India (SEBI) says. She allegedly shared business plans, board meeting agendas and financial projections with the unnamed guru. Ms Ramkrishna quit the bourse in 2016. SEBI said documentation it had gathered during a probe \"clearly showed\" that the yogi was running the NSE, and Ms Ramkrishna was \"merely a puppet in his hands\" until the end of her time in the role. \"The sharing of financial and business plans of NSE... is a glaring, if not unimaginable, act that could shake the very foundations of the stock exchange,\" the regulator said. SEBI fined Ms Ramkrishna 30m rupees (£293,186; $396,975) and banned her for three years from working with any bourse or any firm registered with the regulator as an intermediary. What India's restless Gen Z really wants\nIndia to launch digital rupee as soon as this year An email sent by the BBC to an address regulators had linked to the guru was not immediately answered. No other identifying details were provided by the regulator, except that the yogi is likely to be living in the Himalayan mountain range. In a submission to SEBI, Ms Ramkrishna said she met the yogi on the banks of India's Ganges River nearly two decades ago. Ms Ramkrishna said she had sought his advice on \"many personal and professional matters\" ever since. \"As we know, senior leaders often seek informal counsel from coaches, mentors or other seniors in this industry which are all purely informal in nature. In a similar strain I felt that this guidance would help me perform my role better,\" she said. SEBI called Ms Ramkrishna's actions a \"glaring breach of regulations\", and said her views that her actions did not cause any harm to the market were \"absurd\". The regulator said it had come across email exchanges between the guru and Ms Ramkrishna during an earlier investigation into the NSE. Ms Ramkrishna, who was among the executives who started the NSE in the early 1990s, cited \"personal reasons\" when she left the exchange in 2016. Mind-boggling and implausible are just two of the adjectives being used by social media users in India, reacting to revelations that a nameless 'spiritual guru' in the Himalayas was influencing key business decisions at the country's largest stock exchange. Some even said the story would lend itself well to being adapted into a high-octane web drama. But while \"gobsmacked\" is pretty much the immediate reaction on the street, experts say the bizarre findings by India's stock market regulator are a stinging indictment of the poor corporate governance practices at NSE, which in areas like derivatives is the world's largest exchange. This is particularly ironic given how strict governance rules are for companies listed on such stock exchanges. \"This is a global scandal,\" said Sucheta Dalal, India's foremost investigative journalist and co-author of 'Absolute Power', a deep dive into the exchange's amazing rise, and the algorithm scam which led to the regulator launching the investigation that's brought these issues to light. Calling the inquiry \"shoddy\" Ms Dalal said there needs to be a custodial interrogation of the former boss, who she believes has got away with a mere slap on the wrist. She also questioned the timing of the revelations, suggesting that authorities want to close out any pending regulatory inquiries into NSE, in order to clear the path for its initial public offering. But the issue is unlikely to die down anytime soon, with the jury still out, on the identity of the mysterious yogi at the centre of the drama. The episode has yet again emphasised the need for more robust whistle-blower mechanisms, Amit Tandon, Founder of institutional advisory firm IIAS told the BBC. ",

            "header": "Big banks fund new oil and gas despite net zero pledges",
            "content": "Big banks are pumping billions into new oil and gas production despite net zero pledges, campaigners have said. Banks including HSBC, Barclays and Deutsche Bank are still backing new oil and gas despite being part of a green banking group, ShareAction said. Investors should force banks to demand green plans from fossil fuel firms before funding them, it said. HSBC and Barclays said they were focused on achieving environmental goals. \"Net zero\" means not adding to greenhouse gases already in the atmosphere by cutting and trying to balance out emissions. If the Earth is to avoid damaging environmental effects, including more extreme weather, it needs to limit average global warming to below 1.5 degrees centigrade. To achieve this, we need to get to net zero by 2050, experts have said. As part of getting to net zero, the International Energy Agency has said there should be no new oil and natural gas fields. But big banks are continuing to fund oil and gas expansion with billions of dollars, ShareAction said, despite being part of a UN-led group called the Net Zero Banking Alliance. What is net zero and how are the UK and other countries doing?\nIs a new oil field climate change hypocrisy? HSBC put an estimated $8.7bn (£6.4bn) into new oil and gas in 2021, while Barclays put in $4.5bn, and Deutsche Bank loaned $5.7bn, the campaign group estimated. The fossil fuel giants receiving the funding included Exxon Mobil, Shell, BP, and Saudi Aramco. This is a big drop from 2020, when HSBC alone pumped more than $18bn into new oil and gas, and there were big drops in funding across the board between 2020 and 2021, according to figures from consultancy Profundo. ShareAction said this was due to banks focussing on providing pandemic-related loans to keep fossil fuel firms afloat during the pandemic, and that in 2021 funding returned to pre-pandemic levels. Since joining the Net Zero Banking Alliance last year, 24 big banks have provided $33bn for new oil and gas projects, with more than half of that amount ($19bn) coming from four of the founding members - HSBC, Barclays, BNP Paribas and Deutsche Bank, the campaigners said. ShareAction urged big investors to demand that banks restrict finance for oil and gas expansion, saying funding new oil and gas is a lose-lose for banks and investors. Xavier Lerin, ShareAction senior research manager, said: \"If oil and gas demand decreases in line with 1.5C scenarios, prices will fall and assets will become stranded. \"On the other hand, if demand does not fall enough to limit global warming to 1.5C, the economy will suffer from severe physical climate impacts. \"Either way, value will be destroyed for energy companies, banks and their investors.\" The campaign group added: \"Banks say that they want to help their clients to transition away from fossil fuels, but there is little evidence for this claim.\" \"Most banks - HSBC included - are not demanding transition plans from clients, raising doubts about their commitment to this transition,\" it added. But an HSBC spokesman said the bank was \"committed to working with our customers to achieve a transition towards a thriving low carbon economy\". The bank published its policy to phase out funding coal for energy production in December, and said its oil and gas net zero financing plans would be published on 22 February in its annual report. Barclays said it \"continues to engage with a broad range of stakeholders on climate and sustainability topics\". \"We continue to focus on our ambition to become a net zero bank by 2050, and our commitment to align our financing with the goals and timelines of the Paris Agreement,\" a spokeswoman said. Barclays has a target of a 15% reduction in financed emissions from energy, including coal, oil and gas, by 2025. \"We also have restrictions around the direct financing of new oil and gas exploration projects in the Arctic or financing for companies primarily engaged in oil and gas exploration and production in this region,\" the spokeswoman added. A Deutsche Bank spokesman said: \"Carbon intensive sectors account for only a small share of our loan book and based on publicly available data our lending and underwriting activity in fossil fuels is significantly smaller than global peers'. \"Moreover, our aim is to support all of our customers as we transition to a net zero world.\" Deutsche Bank said it was \"well under way\" to hitting green and social targets of €200bn (£170bn) by 2023, including \"an intense dialogue with clients to move from high-carbon business models towards low and no-carbon ones\". The spokesman added: \"We have committed to align the operational and attributable emissions from our portfolio with pathways to net-zero by 2050 or sooner. \"This includes measuring and subsequently disclosing the carbon intensity of our loan portfolio and developing and disclosing plans to adjust its footprint in accordance with national and international climate targets by end of this year.\" BNP Paribas, which was also named in the ShareAction report, said: \"As the leading bank in continental Europe, BNP Paribas is a major financier of European energy companies that are largely committed to transitioning their model through strong investments in developing renewable energies.\" The bank said it is \"convinced that these players, due to their technical and financial capacities, have the levers necessary to accelerate transition by developing renewable energy and other transformative solutions\". Meanwhile, oil giant Exxon Mobil said that the International Energy Agency and the UN's Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change \"agree that significant investment in oil and gas is still needed in Paris-aligned scenarios\". It said that even in the IEA net zero scenario, \"additional investment of approximately $11tn through 2050 would be required in both oil and natural gas development to meet the world's energy demand\". BP said it \"has a net zero ambition and we have set out a strategy to deliver it\". \"Resilient hydrocarbons are a core part of our strategy, but we are not aiming to grow our oil and gas production - we expect to see production fall 40% from 2019 to 2030. \"We expect to hold investment in oil and gas flat over this decade as output falls, while at the same time expanding our spending in transition growth businesses - including EV charging, convenience, renewables, hydrogen and bioenergy - to around 50% of the total by 2030,\" BP added. Shell declined to comment, and Saudi Aramco was approached for comment. ",

            "content": "Harjinder Butoy says he still hears the echoes of the prison cell door slamming behind him after he was imprisoned for a crime he did not commit. \"I always say, I got three years three months, but it feels like I got a 14-year jail sentence, because I had to clear my name,\" he explains. Mr Butoy and his wife ran the post office in the Nottinghamshire market town of Sutton-in-Ashfield for five years. They invested time and money to turn the business around and did not suspect anything was wrong when auditors turned up to check on the accounts. They had been through an audit the week before with no problems. But Mr Butoy was arrested, charged and sent to jail for stealing £208,000. It took until last year to get that conviction overturned in the High Court. But he doesn't feel like his ordeal is over yet. \"People say you've had your name cleared you're all right now. But it's not, you want justice,\" he tells BBC News. \"I want someone else to be charged and jailed like I was.\" Why were hundreds of sub-postmasters prosecuted?\nPostmasters in IT scandal to get up to £100,000\nPostmaster's widow: 'I will never forgive them' This year, he should at least get some of his questions answered. On Monday, 14 February, the public inquiry into the wrongful of conviction of 706 Post Office branch managers, like Mr Butoy, will begin to hear evidence. Those convictions are the most widespread miscarriage of justice in British legal history, and are now gradually being overturned in the courts. Thousands of others lost huge sums of money as they tried to make up mysterious shortfalls at their branches, which the Post Office is only now beginning to refund. The inquiry is expected to run for the rest of this year and will address why sub-postmasters were singled out and whether they have been justly compensated. Crucially, it will ask whether those at software developer Fujitsu, the Post Office itself or even their biggest shareholder, the government, knew about faults in the system while using that data in court to convict sub-postmasters. Horizon software was introduced into the Post Office network from 1999. The system, developed by the Japanese company Fujitsu, was used for tasks such as transactions, accounting and stocktaking. But problems with Horizon were well known at the time. From his first week in the job, Mr Butoy noticed that the Horizon accounting software was not adding up properly. \"I was £500 short,\" he explained, even though a supervisor had been with him the entire time, making sure he got to grips in his new role. \"I didn't think anything of it. But ever since then, it happened a lot.\" What Mr Butoy noticed, was seen not only by other Post Office branch managers, but also by those who knew the new software inside out. One such expert, Jez Thompson, worked as a team leader for Fujitsu's Horizon Training Project, covering 60,000 Post Office branches over five years from the late 1990s. In many respects, it is a role he remembers with great fondness. \"There were 400 of us, travelling all over the UK, up into little villages or the mountains, by the coast, working with some really fine people,\" he says. \"At the time we were really proud of what we were doing.\" He remembers the meticulous arithmetic skill of the Post Office staff he trained, as well as their loyalty to the business and respect within their communities. But he also remembers regular glitches and bugs that made the software fail to calculate the books accurately. \"Occasionally it would work, but a lot of the time it wouldn't work,\" he says. Mr Thompson and his team were training staff on a version of Horizon they were told perfectly mirrored the one that was live in Post Office branches across the country. \"Anything that was wrong with our system would be wrong on the live system as well,\" he explains. \"And we used to, on a monthly, probably even a weekly basis, pass information up to our managers just informing them that we'd found a glitch and this doesn't work. That's just the way it went.\" Mr Thompson acknowledges that all software applications have bugs. No system is perfect and updates are needed. But he worries, in hindsight, that the rollout was rushed before Horizon was ready. \"I reported them [these issues] to my line manager and he then reported that to a weekly meeting with Fujitsu Training Services, where both Fujitsu and The Post Office would have been present and glitches would've been discussed,\" he says. \"Computers have reels of data. Somewhere there is evidence that somebody knew something.\" The Post Office says that it is \"sincerely sorry\" for the impact of the Horizon scandal, adding they are \"in no doubt about the human cost.\" \"The inquiry's hearings enable many of those who were most deeply affected by Post Office's past failings to voice their experiences and their testimonies must and will ensure all lessons are learned so that such events can never happen again,\" a spokesperson added. \"In addressing the past, our first priority is that full, fair and final compensation is provided and we are making good progress.\" The government has set aside funding to facilitate compensation payments. \"We understand the serious impact that faults with the Horizon IT system and the Post Office's management of the resulting issues have had on affected postmasters and their families - with many losing their livelihoods or being wrongly convicted for crimes they didn't commit,\" Postal Affairs Minister Paul Scully MP said. \"That's why we have set up a statutory inquiry to set out exactly what went wrong and to ensure something like this never happens again, as well as providing financial support for compensation.\" A spokesperson Fujitsu said they are cooperating with the Inquiry. \"The inquiry is examining complex events stretching back over 20 years,\" they added. \"Fujitsu is committed to providing the fullest and most transparent information so that key lessons are learned for the future.\" ",

            "content": "Poundland is selling more fresh food in a bid to attract cash-strapped shoppers to do a weekly shop with the budget chain. It's opening its biggest ever store in Nottingham today which will have shelves of fruit, vegetables and bread. Poundland has been trialling fresh food in a handful of convenience stores but it's the first time the retailer has stocked these items in a main store. It plans to add the new ranges to more than 20 other large stores this year. It's already begun rolling out chilled and frozen food and aims to have that stocked in 350 stores by the autumn. \"It's a natural extension of what our customers are looking for,\" says the managing director of Poundland, Barry Williams. His latest shop, on a retail park on the outskirts of Nottingham, is twice the typical size of a regular Poundland. It feels like a supermarket with trolleys and belted checkouts, as well as beer, wine and spirits. Although grocery sales soared during the pandemic, the going hasn't been easy for discount chains as shoppers returned to the big weekly shop - and did it online. But the boss of Poundland says the discounters are starting to grow again. \"Our business is growing. The size of the basket that shoppers are spending with us is growing quite dramatically.\" \"I'm seeing shoppers shop around a lot more particularly than what they were doing during the pandemic. There are locations that are coming back to life again, I think shoppers are definitely on the hunt for value now\". But, like every other retailer, Poundland is also grappling with rising costs. \"Inflation is hitting us right across the board,\" says Mr Williams. \"The cost of transportation and fuel, the cost of containers - that is double digit percentage inflation that we're seeing right now. And if you think of wage inflation for our colleagues, which we're supportive of, that is high single per cent inflation as well. I've got suppliers approaching us, and they all want cost increases\". The grocery aisles are fiercely competitive. But with shoppers perhaps more price-sensitive than they've ever been, retailers have to balance how much of their costs to pass on without losing customers to rivals. The boss of Poundland says he's determined to keep his prices keen: \"I'm not a magician, I'm not Paul Daniels. I can't magic all of this stuff away. \"What I can do is work as hard as I can on behalf of shoppers, to make sure that we mitigate as much as we can to protect them. Our view is really clear - that people who work the hardest on behalf of shoppers are the ones who are going to win. The ones who just pass that on to the shoppers. Well, shoppers are king, they can go wherever they want.\" ",

            "content": "Soaring energy costs are hitting businesses as hard as they're looming for households, making even diesel generators a more attractive option than buying power from the grid.\nOther costs are crowding in; raw materials, packaging, recruitment and retention, insurance, shipping, haulage, and payroll tax is soon to rise for both employers and employees.\nMore than three-quarters of businesses are putting up prices more than they normally would, or they expect to. And they face the added threat of consumer spending being pulled back as household budgets are soaked up by rising heating and fuel bills. Imagine you've just bought 68 new buses, powered by electric battery. Helped by a wadge of public cash, you wire up your bus depots with chargers. Then the price of electricity goes through the roof, and it turns out that the best business option is to fire them up with power from a diesel-fuelled generator. It's not quite the clean, green future of public transport that we were sold last year at COP26, as big government grants went into renewing bus fleets with batteries. But that's how energy prices are up-ending parts of the economy. The scenario of battery buses powered, albeit indirectly, by dirty diesel has been briefly explored by the chief executive of McGill's Buses. Ralph Roberts tweeted that the procurement team at the Inverclyde-based bus operator had run the numbers on the £624,000 increase in its energy bill. \"They are advising that we charge our zero emission buses by diesel generators,\" he wrote. Three emojis followed, the latter showing an exploding head. He subsequently clarified this was \"to draw attention to the impact that the electricity price rises are about to have\". \"We are NOT suggesting that we actually would use diesel to charge electric buses, except in emergencies,\" he added. For other businesses, the cost of power is already biting. While most businesses lock in prices for at least a year at a time, and often in September, the owner of one food processing firm has told me that he is trialling use of his emergency back-up generator, to see if that will come in cheaper than using the grid supply. He explains that he had budgeted for a 62% increase, as indicated by his supplier. But last week, it said the 62% renewal deal was off the table, and it would instead be an increase of 125%, with the contract lasting six months. And if he didn't like that, moving onto the variable rate would start at more than 300% above his previous contract. \"That's extortion,\" he said. \"Except even the Sopranos wouldn't do that. They knew it was in their interests to keep businesses open.\" He has kept his sense of humour, but only just, saying many such companies are \"looking over the precipice\". He prefers to keep his company's brand out of the media on this subject, for fear of spooking suppliers, customers and trade credit. But unlike McGill's, he is serious about shifting to a diesel-powered generator, even if it goes against the drive to cut emissions. He is also looking at the possibility of moving to night shifts, if his power bill for night-time work can be cheaper than daytime. The pressure on business from soaring bills for oil, gas and electricity is closely aligned with rising prices for households. Companies are seeing sharp increases in raw materials, when they can get them. A survey out this week from the Fraser of Allander economics institute showed two thirds of manufacturers are struggling to get the materials they require. Partly, that is down to increased transport costs. A shipping container from China to Europe went up in price last year by an average of around seven-fold. That disruption is far from over, and prices remain elevated. Haulage within Britain and from the EU was also sharply up, due to the shortage of drivers. Labour costs are up. According to a regular Royal Bank of Scotland survey of recruitment consultants, starting pay for new recruits hit record levels in November, and last month's just below that. An Easter Ross farmer I interviewed last week, Ewan Macdonald, said farm labour wages are up by about 50% - partly due to Brexit, and the difficulty of recruiting workers when they can't be brought from European Union countries. He pointed to a sharp increase in the cost of agricultural machinery, and in red diesel to run it, while fertiliser costs are closely aligned with the cost of gas required to make it. He is looking at fertiliser up at least 50%, and says these costs will have to be passed on. Farm prices are not set by farmers, but by markets. If the price doesn't cover costs, Macdonald says there will be less grain sown or less fertiliser used. Either way, that curtails supply later this year, putting further upward pressure on prices. James Withers, chief executive of trade body Food and Drink Scotland, adds insurance costs to the bill, pushed up by the increased risks businesses face with Covid, as insurers try to cover themselves against the consequences of renewed restrictions to trade. And an index of packaging costs, across all sectors, is running at more than 30% up on last year, having peaked above 60% during last year. In sectors which have benefited from temporary tax cuts, those are being unwound, including VAT on hospitality returning to 20%, from 12.5% since October, and 5% before then. Business rates reductions for the most Covid-hit sectors are removed later in the year. The regular Allander monitor, covering more than 400 Scottish firm and working with legal firm Addleshaw Goddard, found 80% of companies were expecting to raise prices more than usual, and 20% will cut back production because of rising costs. In December and January, 80% were struggling to recruit staff, while quarter were finding it difficult to retain workers. Nearly half expected weak or very weak growth this year - although at the time of the survey, the Omicron variant of Covid-19 may have cast a longer shadow than it does now. That was reinforced on Thursday, when a survey of 1,000 British Chambers of Commerce members showed 73% of firms were already putting up prices, in response to pressures that have been building for some months. Fuel was a big issue for more than 60% of them, and wages for a similar share, while 90% of manufacturers said raw material costs were rising. One in twenty were thinking they may stop trading. Looming in little more than six weeks is a hike in National Insurance Contributions (NICs). That can seem stealthy, in that not that many people understand it. But it's hitting employment twice. NICs from employees - at 12% for most earnings, falling to 2% above £50,000 - are going up by 1.25%. Also in April, employer NICs are rising from 13.8% to 15.05% of pay. And there is a circular effect to this. If someone on £30,000 is taking a £250 cut in take-home pay because of NICs, plus a £700 increase in fuel bills, plus food prices rising, they are going to have less to spend on the discretionary items - from upmarket food to gym membership to holidays and a new car - that many further companies, and their employees, depend on selling. So while much attention is focussed on the upstream oil and gas producers and the vast profits announced in recent days, many other businesses are in similar positions to households in the inflation pressures they face.

            "content": "The price of pasta, tinned tomatoes and strawberry jam jumped last year as the cost of supermarket staples rose, new figures for the BBC suggest. Overall, the price of a basket filled with 15 standard food items rose by £1.32, or 8%, in just one year. Changes in the average cost of the food items at Asda, Morrisons, Sainsbury's and Tesco were tracked by retail research firm Assosia. Some items fell in price, with carrots and mild cheddar seeing small declines. The same basket of food made up of items from the cheaper \"value\" ranges at the supermarkets recorded an overall fall in price, down 45p, or 4%. But within that, items such as pasta and vanilla ice cream saw rises of more than 6%. Other items the firm tracked in the new research for BBC News included tortilla chips, fish fingers, honey, blueberries, carrots and lemons. Although official figures suggest that the overall cost of living increased by 5.4% in the year to December, this number - known as the inflation rate - can mask some steep rises seen at the tills, especially on everyday items. There are many factors that can make it difficult to track how prices are changing for households, such as promotions at supermarkets or a lack of availability of certain products. Asda, for example, recently pledged to stock its budget ranges in all of its 581 supermarkets and online after complaints from anti-poverty campaigner Jack Monroe. \"Looking at food prices is a bit of a minefield\", says Kay Staniland, director at Assosia. Her company selected a snapshot of popular products that were comparable across the value and standard ranges. \"I think the figures show that retailers are trying to avoid the biggest increases to value lines as much as possible. But these value lines do make up a small part of total ranges. The standard mid-tier range is where the largest volume of sales come from,\" she says. Adam Leyland, editor of The Grocer magazine, also tracks a weekly basket of goods and how prices differ across the supermarket aisles. He says \"we're now in a 'once in a generation' moment for food inflation in the UK\". \"We've not seen anything like this since the financial crash in 2008. And this is just the start. It's going to go on for two or two and a half years, probably as various costs and problems filter through into the system.\" Inflation is everywhere in the food supply chain, he says, from rising energy and labour costs to raw materials and packaging. Marmite maker set to raise prices as costs soar\n‘How can we afford anything with bills this high?’\nWhy are prices rising so quickly? The supermarkets are now grappling with how much of these costs to pass on. \"The food market is incredibly competitive and if you put your prices up ahead of the competition, the shopper will notice. Right now, more than ever, price is the major focus for the shopper. And they will vote with their feet,\" he says. Shoppers such as Fernanda Almeida have already been feeling the pinch, though. She lives with her partner in Worcester and the pair used to purchase ready-meals, or pots of instant porridge, which he could take along to his military barracks where cooking space is limited. But after the shopping bill went up by about £20 a week, they introduced some changes. \"Our shopping has changed completely... we're definitely cooking from scratch a lot more now because it just works out cheaper,\" Fernanda says. She says she feels \"worried\". \"I've gone from someone who has a budget per month but goes to the shop without a list, picks up things that I fancy eating, to planning each meal, checking items off against the list.\" She's noticed that tinned items in particular have gone up in price and it can often be cheaper to buy individual items for recipes in larger supermarkets, even in comparison with discount stores like Aldi or Lidl. Vimbai Gwata-St John in Bexley has seen her food shop go up by about £20 a week, too. As a mum to an 18-week-old baby with food intolerances she has had to chop and change what they are buying from week to week. She says she used to follow a budget strictly until she became ill during her pregnancy. \"Because of that, we didn't have time or ability to track our expenses, we just bought what we needed out of desperation because of the other problems at that point in our lives.\" Now she is trying to get the budget back on track and is looking at couponing or starting to buy items such as toilet paper or nappies in bulk. Although prices are going up across the board, she says: \"The one thing you can't compromise on is food.\" How supermarkets manage their own inflationary pressures will have consequences for millions of households. And the least well-off, which spend a bigger share of income on essentials such as food and energy, are less able to absorb soaring prices in the aisles. The big four supermarket chains have learned from the mistakes they made in 2008, when they put prices up. Aldi and Lidl swooped, stealing customers and market share. Their businesses have since doubled in size and are still opening new stores. \"It's a real dog-eat-dog situation,\" says Adam Leyland. \"The battleground is value. And they are determined to stop them (the discounters) making further grounds. For instance, Tesco and Sainsbury's are price-matching Aldi. Cost cutting, shrinkflation - reducing the size of a product but not the price - and cutting back on expensive ingredients are just some of the tactics that retailers are using to mitigate the rising cost of groceries. But the trend is clear. Assosia recorded more than 17,000 price increases across the main supermarkets last month, more than double the number in the same month last year, and across every category. \"Inflation is everywhere\" says Mr Leyland. And he agrees with the recent warning from John Allan, the chairman of Tesco, that the worst is yet to come. ",

One idea is a four-day working week and the BBC has been getting the thoughts of those who have already made the change. IGO4 is a digital insurance business based in Peterborough and all of its employees now work four days a week, rather than the standard five. The company asks staff to work an additional hour each working day to receive an extra day off with no change in salary. Vauxhall UK factory safe with electric vehicle plan\nUK digital bank introduces four-day work week\n'I can't see myself going back to a five-day week' Chief executive Matt Munro says the pandemic alerted more people to the possibilities of flexible working. \"Going back to old ways of working isn't right,\" he says. \"We recognised we had the opportunity to take the positives from our Covid experience and create a new working environment that would make a genuine difference to people's wellbeing. \"By giving everyone that day off where they can have me-time and then come back rested, we think we will get more out of them and improve work-life balance.\" Marketing executive at iGO4, Georgia Prosser, says the shorter working week is \"fantastic\". \"I have time do things I wouldn't necessarily do,\" she says. \"Any DIY I need to do, anything boring like that, that I wouldn't get time to do on a weekend.\" Ms Prosser says she is also making the most of a three-day weekend by visiting different places. Despite having less time to get work done, Ms Prosser says she has found it \"incredibly easy\" to manage her workload. \"If you start thinking about efficiency, cutting down meeting times, not attending meetings where you're not needed - you actually find you get a lot more time back,\" she says. Perry Timms runs People and Transformational HR, based in Finedon, Northamptonshire, and is a campaigner for a four-day week. Mr Timms accepts that a shorter working week may not be for all industries, such as those with a supply chain. \"Businesses need to ask themselves if they are pushing people to the limit,\" he says. \"Is it pushing their focus and concentration to the limit? \"Can we get more from them in less time because they are rested?\" Mr Timms hopes the way of working will be adopted by others as businesses return to a \"new normal\" as social restrictions due to the pandemic are eased.

            "content": "With half-term about to start and coronavirus testing easing for fully-vaccinated travellers arriving in the UK, airports are hoping the flights industry will really start to take off again. Luton Airport is expecting 90,000 passengers over the next week and it hopes this number will continue to rise. But what does it mean for the travellers and the business community? The airport is run by London Luton Airport (LLA), but is owned by Luton Rising, which is a company owned by Luton Borough Council, which relies on income from the airport. Alberto Martin, LLA's chief executive, says \"it's been a very difficult couple of years for all of us, but I get the impression we're starting to see the light at the end of the tunnel and there are lots of reasons to be optimistic\". \"The airlines are telling us that sales are looking really good for half-term and the fact that the travel restrictions are being eased, this is going to make it as easy as it's always been [to travel].\" From 04:00 GMT on Friday, all testing requirements were removed for fully-vaccinated arrivals, with only a Passenger Locator Form required. Anyone who is not fully vaccinated will still need to take a pre-departure test and a PCR test on or before day two after they arrive in the UK.

Despite his optimism, he says ongoing uncertainty about Covid-19 means \"we are not out of the woods\". He says it is still too early to know if summer bookings will increase but he is hopeful those numbers will also rise. Diane Kitson has packed her bags for a skiing trip and is flying to Lyon. \"This is our first trip in three years; it's exciting,\" she says. She says the easing of travel restrictions \"makes a big difference coming back to the UK\" and she is pleased she does not have to do a test to get home. \"I'm still very cautious; I'm still doing all the tests and sanitising, and all the things we need to do; it's important to still keep going with it for a bit.\" She is looking forward to a \"bit more of a normal life again - hopefully!\" For James Dymond and his family, their flight to France will be the first family holiday in two years. They managed to get away in February 2020, before lockdown restrictions came in, and says they have just taken holidays in the UK after they failed to get to France again in 2020. \"It's quite exciting, in a strange way; it ought to be quite normal, but it's really nice to be able to do it again, it felt like it's been a bit of a hurdle in terms of the testing, but it's quite normal really,\" he says. He adds that the easing of testing to get home did not make any difference to him as \"we would have gone anyway, but it's nice to know we haven't got that hassle when we come back\". Liam Grundy, commercial and business director for Lagardère Travel Retail, which owns and runs the duty free store at the airport, is pleased footfall is increasing. \"We're seeing some really good green shoots of recovery,\" he says. \"After a difficult two years and having to close our stores in line with lockdown, it feels really good to be open consistently and we expect to be open for the foreseeable future. \"Right now [the number of] customers coming through the store is directly related to the number of people travelling, which depends on restrictions and the cost of travel for people. \"We are really hopeful for a strong summer... of course there is some uncertainty - we don't think we will get back to 2019 levels, but we are expecting a busier summer.\" This means the company has started to recruit more staff and he says it has been very lucky - because of the furlough scheme it did not have to lay off any of its 100 staff.

            "header": "UK economy rebounds with fastest growth since WW2",
            "content": "The UK economy rebounded last year with growth of 7.5% despite falling back in December due to Omicron restrictions, official figures show. It was the fastest pace of growth since 1941, although it came after a dramatic 9.4% collapse in 2020 as the pandemic forced parts of the economy to shut. In December, the economy shrank 0.2% as Omicron restrictions hit the hospitality and retail sectors. Chancellor Rishi Sunak said the economy had been \"remarkably resilient\". The Office for National Statistics (ONS) figures showed that in the last three months of 2021 growth was 1%, which ONS director of economic statistics Darren Morgan said was \"pretty healthy\" given Omicron's spread and the introduction of some restrictions. The figures were stronger than expected, and Mr Morgan told the BBC the expansion in 2021 showed the UK was the fastest growing economy in the G7 group of nations. However, he urged caution about making strict comparisons. \"The growth in 2021 comes from a low base in 2020, when the economy fell sharply,\" Mr Morgan said. \"And if you look at where the UK economy is now, compared to its pre-pandemic level... the UK is middle of the pack, compared with the G7.\" He said using this comparison, the US, Canadian and French economies were above the UK's, while the UK was above Italy, Germany and Japan. The worst of the overall pandemic economic hit is now behind us but the aftershocks remain. Downing Street is unlikely to avoid the opportunity to boast about 2021. During its hosting of the G7, the UK is now confirmed as the fastest growing economy of these major nations. But that comparison needs a great dollop of context. The 7.5% growth the UK economy recorded in 2021 is the highest of the G7 major economies and that does indicate a strong bounceback. This, as the ONS points to, should be seen alongside the sharpest fall of 9.4% for the UK compared to those same economies in 2020. On the internationally comparable basis, the economy is still slightly smaller than it was at the end of December 2019, unlike the US, France and Canada. On the slightly more timely basis, using monthly data not available in other countries, the UK economy is larger than it was in February 2020. The UK economy grew by 1% in the final quarter of 2021, a little lower than expectations, as the spread of the Omicron variant weighed on the economy in December. But as ever during these extraordinary times, this already looks like a rear view mirror on events. Looking forward, the extraordinary cost of living squeeze, with energy and other prices leading to falls in average living standards, is the significant iceberg for the economy in 2022. The ONS said that despite the fall in December, on a monthly basis GDP was in line with its pre-coronavirus level in February 2020. However, GDP in the October-to-December quarter remains 0.4% below its pre-Covid levels in the final three months of 2019. What is GDP and how does it affect me?\nInterest rates rise again in bid to cool prices\nSurging food prices push inflation to 30-year high Mr Sunak told the BBC: \"Today's figures show that despite Omicron the economy was remarkably resilient. We were the fastest growing economy in the G7 last year and are forecast to continue being the fastest growing economy this year. \"But I know that people are worried about rising prices, particularly energy bills... and that's why last week we announced a significant package of support to help millions of families meet the cost of bills.\" Last year's growth was the strongest since ONS records began in 1948 and the fastest since 1941, during World War Two, using data collected by the Bank of England. The slump of 9.4% in 2020 was the biggest drop since 1919 when there was demobilisation after World War One. After 18 months of uncertainty, Ollie Vaulkhard's coffee shop and restaurant chain in north east England was seeing a strong end to 2021. He told the BBC's Wake up to Money programme that October and November were great months for the Vaulkhard Group as the economy opened up, but then things started to slow when Omicron hit. \"We lost customers, we lost staff to isolation and we had people being cautious because they had plans for Christmas.\" He doesn't regard December as a disaster, more a loss of momentum. \"We lost the fizz off the top of a glass of champagne,\" he said. A better December would have been a good launch into 2022, when Mr Vaulkhard expects some tough times. \"We have wage cost rises, we have supply cost rises, we've had some brewery costs going up by 7% - they are all large,\" he said. The pandemic and lockdown kept a lid on costs for two years, but suddenly it's changing. \"I would prefer not to have them [price rises], but given the challenges we had this seems like another bridge to cross that we'll have to find a way over.\" The economy is expected to face headwinds in 2022. Last week, the Bank of England raised interest rates, cut its economic growth forecast from 5% to 3.75% for this year and predicted that households were about to suffer the sharpest fall in living standards since records began three decades ago. This, said Labour's shadow chief secretary to the Treasury, Pat McFadden, would mean the economy will \"crawl\" this year and see the slowest growth of any G7 country. \"The reality is the way the government runs our economy is trapping us in a high tax, low growth cycle,\" he said. Inflation is forecast to hit 7% in April, the same month workers and firms will start to see a rise in their National Insurance (NI) contributions. Mr Sunak has been under pressure to scrap the NI increase, but vowed this month that it would go ahead. Thomas Pugh, an economist at RSM UK, said he expected output lost during December and January to be regained in February and March, \"meaning that Omicron should not have had a lasting impact on the economy\". But he warned that consumer spending power would take a big hit in 2002. Suren Thiru, head of economics at the British Chamber of Commerce, said that \"crippling\" inflation, tax rises in April, and higher energy bills means \"the UK economy is facing a materially weaker 2022\".

It is worth billions in sales, but run \"like a cottage industry\" - the kind of cottage where there's a noisy feud with the neighbours, and the kind of industry where growth is grinding to a halt. Scotland pioneered the farming of the Atlantic salmon 51 years ago in Lochaber, and it has grown to become Britain's biggest food export, while a major economic presence from Norway to Chile. But limited to offshore sites in the west of Scotland and northern isles, growth has been stalled by a shipwreck of a regulatory regime. As the global industry has grown in the past decade, Scotland's share of it has fallen from 10% to only 6%. Salmon Scotland, formerly the Scottish Salmon Producers Organisation, cites experts who think it could soon fall to 3% of global output, as the Faroes and Iceland expand production.

Having reviewed other industries and found some similarities, he reported that he had never seen the level of \"mistrust, dislike, and vitriol at both an institutional and personal level between the industry (mainly finfish), certain regulators, parts of the Scottish government and other stakeholders\". It's not as bad with shellfish and the nascent seaweed farming sector. He goes on: \"There are those in the industry who believe officials within some regulators and government bodies have on occasion been actively briefing and supplying information against the industry to those that would seek to close it down completely\". Think about that for a moment: some people in salmon farming think officialdom is trying to close them down by leaking information about them. \"The converse to this are the accusations from some environmental groups that the Scottish Government and regulators are 'green washing' or 'in bed' with the industry,\" Professor Griggs continues. He adds, \"I make no judgement on whether either is true but these beliefs have driven relationships and mistrust to a level that is not just unusual but unhelpful as well.\" To rewind for some context, Prof Griggs is the go-to guy for Scottish and UK governments on this and numerous other subjects. This includes setting up the South of Scotland enterprise agency, rules for banks on how to close a branch and compensating customers for fraud in Lloyds Banking Group. This reflects his thorough, breezy, down-to-earth approach to both reviewing and communicating his findings. Following through on an SNP manifesto commitment last year, which itself was a compromise to avoid taking a strong line on a contentious issue in the election campaign, the new rural affairs secretary Mairi Gougeon asked Prof Griggs to review aquaculture regulation. There had been numerous attempts to sort out the problems with fish farming; environmental, in animal welfare, fish disease, in food safety and the licence system. But as Prof Griggs points out, even the best regulation fed into a poorly operating system is going to become bad regulation. And that's what we've got. The aquaculture industry has long complained that there are at least four regulatory bodies that have a say over fish farm activities, and each of them has to consult with each other before a licence can be approved or amended. Developers require planning consent, a marine licence, a food business operating licence and a seabed lease. It is supposed to take no more than two years and eight weeks to get through the process. The Griggs review finds that is the least time that can be expected. The industry would prefer it to be speeded up, even if it means it gets to 'no' in a reasonable timeframe. The business studies professor notes that some of the scientific evidence used in this process is not credible, that some regulators don't have the know-how to do the job when it only rarely crosses their screens, while it's pointed out that some impose conditions on licences while having no clue how they're going to inspect or enforce them. The better news is that Shetland has somehow avoided the worst of this, not least because there is community support for the industry. It won't come as a surprise, therefore, that Shetlanders produce 20% of Scottish salmon and 70% of commercial mussel beds. So what is Prof Griggs recommending? A lot of change, including a much clearer element of community benefit as part of the licensing regime. He wants to see a \"single consenting document\" (what you might call 'a licence') most likely controlled by the Marine Scotland agency. It should include a \"social contract\" with the local community. To find out how to get that licence, it should be possible to go to one website and find out how to get consent. The science used in the consenting process should be independently checked, so that everyone can agree on it. As with much of this, Norway shows the way, with an aquaculture science body. The Scottish government is being told that it needs to produce a 10-year framework for the industry, and within a year. Once in place, every existing fish farm site should be examined, to make sure it's within the framework. If not, they should close. That shows there are high stakes in getting that framework right. Prof Griggs wants a single licence payment for additional tonnage allowance from fish farms. This would pay for regulation, scientific research and community benefit. A separate charge for existing tonnage is then recommended. And that's where the dull business of regulation feeds into the reality, off our shores, of an industry that produces a lot of food, employs a lot of people, and earns a lot in exports. The brake on growth for the industry is because each site is limited to 2500 tonnes of biomass (fish), with only six farms securing permission in the past three years to go beyond that. If licensing is reformed, they could close those shoreside sites in sea lochs where they are accused of environmental damage to wild fish stocks and to the seabed, relocating further offshore in stronger cages, with permission to have far more fish in them. Meanwhile, shellfish and seaweed should get their own regimes, which may bring new controversy and conflict with those who have other views - often very strong ones - about how we should be looking after our seas. Prof Griggs points out that a commercial scale of seaweed farming, when it moves beyond the pilot stage, looks like areas measuring at least five by seven kilometres - not so much a farm as a sea ranch. Note: This article was corrected on 2 March 2022 to reflect the fact that the Scottish Environment Protection Agency (SEPA) has given consent since 2019, when rules changed, for six farms to hold more than 2500 tonnes of fish. Five of these were for up to 3500 tonnes. SEPA also highlights that allowing the change of licence conditions depends on \"the capacity of the sea to assimilate the waste that the farm will discharge\". ",

            "content": "Beer sales plunged in the UK during the Covid pandemic as people avoided pubs and drank wine and spirits at home instead, industry analysis found. Pubs, bars and restaurants lost £5.7bn of revenue from beer sales in 2021 alone, the British Beer and Pub Association (BBPA) said. It called on the government to cut beer duty to help it recover from the effects of the pandemic restrictions. The Treasury said it froze beer duty for a fourth year saving brewers £900m. People started drinking at home more during the pandemic, splashing out on wine and spirits while pubs, bars and restaurants had to grapple with changing Covid restrictions, the BBPA said. In 2021, pubs, bars, restaurants and clubs served the equivalent of 1.4 billion pints less, the trade body said. Beer prices will have to rise, says Cobra founder\nProsecco and pint taxes to fall, red wine to rise Emma McClarkin, chief executive of the BBPA, said every unsold pint was \"a stark reminder of the dislocating effect Covid restrictions had on our sector and the communities our pubs sit at the heart of\". The industry group also analysed alcohol taxes collected from March 2020, when the first lockdowns started in the UK, to October 2021, when some of the restrictions were relaxed. It found beer receipts fell by £681m to £5.4bn, while wine receipts increased £583m to £7.7bn and spirits receipts rose £784m to £6.9bn. The BBPA also called for taxes to be linked to the strength of the alcoholic drink, with lower-alcohol drinks being taxed less. \"Our analysis showing falling beer consumption supports the Treasury's stated objective to incentivise lower-strength products and differentiate beer from stronger wine and spirits as part of planned reforms to the alcohol duty system,\" Ms McClarkin added. \"We must again ask ministers to go further and support our recovery by continuing to reduce the punitive tax burden on our sector to ensure the sustainability of brewing and pubs.\" However, Richard Piper, chief executive of charity and campaign group Alcohol Change UK, said \"Alcohol duty overall must rise faster than inflation every year, so we reduce, not increase, alcohol harm\". He argued lowering the taxes on beer would not benefit pubs either. \"It would apply equally to the supermarkets, and because of purchasing volumes this in fact makes the differential between pub and supermarket prices even bigger - harming pubs,\" he said. \"Beer duty cuts are primarily called for from the huge manufacturers, not pub landlords. These massive beer producers, many of them not even based in the UK, love to hide behind the pub image, while behind the scenes they are raking in millions in profit from alcohol harm.\" He said Alcohol Change supported the Treasury's proposals, along with the BBPA, to bring in a cut to duty on draught beer and cider. The \"draught relief\", he said, would support pubs \"far more effectively than a blanket reduction in beer duty, which would only subsidise the already dirt-cheap supermarket prices\". The Treasury said draught relief - aimed at supporting pubs by cutting taxes on their most popular products - would see the duty on a pint fall by 5%. Under the new plans, a pint of 3.4% alcohol beer will attract 25p less in duty and VAT. A spokesman said the government had \"comprehensively backed pubs and brewers alike throughout the pandemic\" through the furlough scheme, grants, reduced VAT and business rates relief. \"We welcomed views from the industry on the qualifying criteria for our proposed alcohol duty reforms as part of a consultation process and we're currently analysing responses,\" he added.

            "content": "A claim by a committee of MPs that HM Revenue and Customs (HMRC) looks \"soft on fraud\" has been met by a robust response by the tax authority. Inaction over tracking down fraudulent claims for Covid support risked \"rewarding the unscrupulous\", the Public Accounts Committee (PAC) said. But HMRC said that it rejected many of the statements in the PAC report. Treasury minister Lord Agnew recently resigned over what he called schoolboy errors relating to Covid grants. He said that there had been woeful efforts to stop abuse of pandemic support schemes. The PAC report into the performance of HMRC suggested the tax authority was already facing challenges from Brexit and modernising the tax system before the pandemic. While MPs said it had done well in setting up and operating Covid response schemes, the knock-on effect had been \"poor performance, delays and backlogs in key aspects of tax administration\". This included a decline in customer service. Meanwhile, the department now faced tackling \"an avalanche of error and fraud\" on Covid scheme payments. Meg Hillier, who chairs the committee, said the committee was concerned about how long it would take for the tax authority to catch up. \"The level of fraud and error in furlough that employers will get away with is a real concern. What signal does it send when HMRC rolls over on billions of pounds of fraud and error directly related to Covid support packages? With the current parlous state of the public finances we can ill-afford to be so cavalier over so much taxpayers' money,\" she said. \"Every taxpayers' pound lost to a fraudster will lead to honest ordinary people feeling the post-pandemic pinch harder and harder.\" 'My name was used to steal a government Covid loan'\nChancellor denies ignoring Covid support fraud The committee said that the cost of error and fraud in Covid schemes was £6bn, and HMRC's plan - even if successful - gave the impression it would fail to recover £4bn of that money. The government had already disputed that it had written off £4.3bn of loans, and HMRC said that nothing had been written off. \"While we acknowledge lessons that need to be learned in this report, we reject many of the statements made by the PAC. No fraudulent payments have been written off and we are taking action on multiple fronts to recover overpayments,\" a spokesman said. \"The vast majority of payments in the schemes were made correctly to employers, and most error and fraud was legitimate claimants making mistakes or inflating their claims, often small amounts per case. \"Our Covid support schemes were implemented at unprecedented speed to protect millions of jobs and businesses at a time when families needed it the most.\" HMRC also rejected criticism of its customer service, saying the services were maintained \"while delivering the Covid support schemes, the UK's smooth transition from the European Union and the essential services that keep the tax system running\".

            "header": "Four Gupta steel firms face winding up orders",
            "content": "Winding up petitions have been issued against four companies owned by metals tycoon Sanjeev Gupta. Court records revealed one of the firms included Speciality Steel UK Limited, a division of Liberty Steel, which employs about 2,000 people in England. Three other firms, Liberty Pipes, Liberty Performance Steels and Liberty Merchant Bar, also had petitions against them. Court documents show the four companies owe HM Revenue & Customs (HMRC) £26.3m. Mr Gupta's GFG Alliance, which owns the businesses, was forced into a financial restructuring last year. This happened because its key lender, Greensill Capital, collapsed. Since then it has been racing to shore up its finances under growing pressure from creditors and the tax authorities. Speciality Steel UK Limited, which supplies the aerospace and oil and gas sectors, has sites in Stocksbridge and Rotherham. A winding up petition is a form of legal action taken by a creditor against a company that owes them money. If the company is deemed to be insolvent, an official receiver will be appointed to liquidate the company. Speciality Steel's case is not expected to take place until late March. It is unclear at what stage the petitions are against the other three companies facing legal action. MPs call for probe into Liberty Steel 'red flags'\nHow metal tycoon Sanjeev Gupta built his empire A spokesman for Mr Gupta's GFG Alliance said: \"Our priority has been to protect thousands of jobs in the UK. \"We are committed to repaying all our creditors and continue to work with all stakeholders around the UK to create a sustainable future for our businesses following the collapse of Greensill Capital.\" The Community, Unite and GMB unions, who represent the steel industry, said in a joint statement: \"This action by HMRC threatens thousands of jobs and is a devastating blow to our members and their families. Liberty Steel is a strategically important business, crucial to delivering net zero, and under no circumstances can our plants be allowed to close.\" A spokesperson for HMRC said: \"We take a supportive approach to dealing with customers who have tax debts, working with them to find the best possible solution based on their financial circumstances.\" GFG Alliance said it was operating against a \"very challenging\" backdrop, as record high energy prices drove up its overheads. It added that it was in continuous dialogue with its creditors, including HMRC, to find an \"amicable solution\" that was in the best interest of all stakeholders. \"Short term actions that risk destabilising these efforts are not in anyone's interest, and undermine creditor recovery at a critical stage in our debt restructuring efforts that seek to secure the future of our businesses,\" said a spokesman for GFG. Community, Unite and GMB called on GFG and HMRC \"to get back round the table and hammer out a deal that provides space for the company to refinance\". \"The best route to protect jobs and repay HMRC and other creditors would be to enable the business to continue to trade,\" they said. Steel producers have expressed concerns in recent months over the impact of soaring energy costs on the UK sector, which the industry says puts it at a disadvantage to global competitors. \"Lots of countries around the world are supporting their steel sectors, but in the UK the industry is on its own\", said Chris McDonald, a former executive at Tata Steel who now runs the Materials Processing Institute. \"In France, the industry is supported with energy subsidies and trade protections. In Germany, heavy energy users in industry get big rebates.\" He said specialist UK steel products were in demand and must be supported. \"The steelworks in Rotherham and Stocksbridge are important national assets and if the company that runs them can't continue to operate, then we need to find a way to enable the asset to continue beyond that,\" said Mr McDonald. \"The government have done that before with British Steel for a period of time, and of course we do it all the time with our railways.\" A spokesperson for the Department of Business, Energy & Industrial Strategy said: \"The government is closely monitoring developments around Liberty Steel and continues to engage closely with the company.\" They added: \"As always, we stand ready to support their dedicated employees and their families affected by any developments. \"We have provided extensive support to the steel sector as a whole to help with the costs of electricity and are working with them to support their low carbon transition.\" Meanwhile, earlier on Thursday the Financial Reporting Council announced it was investigating HW Fisher, the auditor to Liberty Commodities which is another of Mr Gupta's businesses. The accounting watchdog said the probe concerned HW Fisher's audit of Liberty Commodities' financial statements for the year to 31 March 2020. GFG Alliance, which is a collection of businesses and investments owned by Mr Gupta and his family, has been under investigation by the Serious Fraud Office since May 2021. The agency said it was investigating \"suspected fraud, fraudulent trading and money laundering in relation to the financing and conduct of the business of companies within the Gupta Family Group Alliance\".

She said she wanted to spend more time with her sons to \"ease the challenge\" in what was a \"big year\" for them.

            "content": "Unilever, the firm behind brands such as Marmite and Dove Soap, has said it will put up its prices again this year as its overheads continue to rise. The consumer goods giant, which already raised prices in 2021, said the cost of some its goods would climb but it would vary from country to country. Many firms are struggling with rising raw material, wage and energy costs. Unilever said: \"We don't want to put prices up but we're seeing the highest inflation we've seen in a decade. \"There will be price increases on some products and in some markets but it will not be uniform across the world.\" Unilever, which also makes Ben & Jerry's ice cream and Hellmann's mayonnaise, said it was facing €3.5bn (£2.95bn) of extra costs in 2022 alone. It said it expected strong growth in sales this year as it raises prices, but also forecast a sharp decline in its profit margins. Other big firms have already revealed price rises to offset increased costs, including High Street giant Next, which said its prices would jump by up to 6% this year. Greggs, Britain's biggest bakery chain, said it had boosted prices between 5p and 10p on items across its range of sausage rolls and cakes, while Pret a Manger is upping the price of its coffee subscription service to £25 a month from £20. Next and Greggs raise prices as costs spiral\nShoppers hit with sharpest price rises in a decade\nDon't ask for a big pay rise, warns Bank boss Food prices are also set to rise further, with the boss of Tesco warning supermarket prices could increase by as much as 5% by the spring. It comes as pay rises are failing to keep up with the rise in the cost of living, recent official figures show, putting the biggest squeeze on household finances in decades. However, the British Chambers of Commerce (BCC) also warned of a \"cost-of-doing-business crisis\" and called on the chancellor to help companies. Hannah Essex, the co-executive director of the BCC, told the BBC's Today programme: \"These price pressures have been building over the course of the last year, and it has now reached the point where businesses are passing that cost onto other businesses and to consumers.\" It was partly due to global issues, she said, but added that there are \"levers that the government can pull to make things better\". Ms Essex called for an energy cap for smaller businesses and for the National Insurance increase set for April to be postponed for at least a year, adding that businesses could no longer absorb costs. \"It has reached the point where [firms] simply don't have a choice [but to put up prices],\" she said. She gave examples of a laundrette in Kent that has had a 250% increase in energy costs and companies seeing a 70% increase in the cost of raw materials. According to a BCC survey of 1,000 of its members, three in four businesses are putting up their prices to cover higher costs. The most commonly reported cost pressure was wages: 63% of firms overall - and 70% of manufacturers - reported rising wage demands causing pressure. This was closely followed by energy costs. The survey found 62% of companies said soaring energy bills were creating pressure, while 90% of manufacturing firms said higher raw material costs were an issue. In response to these pressures, 73% of firms said they were raising prices, while one in 20 respondents to the poll said they were considering ceasing trade completely. Consumer price inflation is on course to rise above 7% this year, a threat that recently prompted the boss of the Bank of England to urge workers to not ask for big pay rises, to try to stop prices rising out of control. However, a new report by recruiters said starting salaries for permanent and temporary staff were being driven up due to a scarcity of candidates. \"With competition for staff still hot, companies are having to raise pay rates for new starters to attract the best people, and the cost of living crisis means there is also more pressure from jobseekers who want a pay rise,\" said Neil Carberry, chief executive of the Recruitment and Employment Confederation (REC), which worked on the report with KPMG. The Treasury said it was aware of the strains caused by higher energy bills and was in \"regular contact\" with business groups and energy suppliers to \"see how they can best be supported\". A spokesman said the government had backed businesses through the pandemic with \"unprecedented\" support and would \"continue to stand firmly behind them\".

Kevin Kish, director of the DFEH, said the agency \"found evidence that Tesla's Fremont factory is a racially segregated workplace where black workers are subjected to racial slurs and discriminated against in job assignments, discipline, pay and promotion\". It claimed that employees would refer to areas where Black or African-American staff worked with racist historical names, such as \"the plantation\". The lawsuit, filed after an investigation by the agency, also alleged that one worker heard racial slurs \"as often as 50-100 times a day\". But Tesla claimed that over the past five years the DFEH has been asked by individuals to investigate the company on nearly 50 occasions \"On every single occasion, when the DFEH closed an investigation, it did not find misconduct against Tesla,\" the firm said in a blog. \"It therefore strains credibility for the agency to now allege, after a three-year investigation, that systematic racial discrimination and harassment somehow existed at Tesla.\" It also said that the claims \"focused on alleged misconduct by production associates at the Fremont factory that took place between 2015 and 2019\". Last year, Tesla was ordered to pay $137m (£101m) in damages for failing to stop a black former worker at its Fremont factory from being abused. Tesla has since appealed against the multi-million dollar settlement granted to former lift operator, Owen Diaz. The company, which is led by chief executive Elon Musk, said in its blog that it is the \"last remaining automobile manufacturer in California\", has \"a majority-minority workforce\" and provides well-paid jobs to 30,000 people.

            "content": "Disney says trips to its US theme parks have surged, while subscriptions to its streaming service beat expectations. The company said sales at its domestic attractions climbed above pre-pandemic levels, but warned it expects parks abroad to still be affected by Covid. Meanwhile, Disney+ added 11.8 million subscribers in the last three months of 2021, taking the total to almost 130 million worldwide. The firm also forecast further subscriber growth for this year. Disney+, the company's two-year-old streaming service, helped to keep the business afloat when the pandemic disrupted its legacy theme parks, resorts and cruise operations. Its latest film Encanto has been hugely popular, with one of its songs We Don't Talk About Bruno making it to number one in the UK top 40 - the first original Disney song to do so. The boost in sign-ups to Disney+ also suggests that some pandemic-related stay-at-home habits may be sticking, despite concerns after Netflix had warned that its own growth was slowing. Chief executive Bob Chapek said he believed the streaming service will have 230 million to 260 million subscribers by 2024. \"This marks the final year of the Walt Disney Company's first century, and performance like this coupled with our unmatched collection of assets and platforms, creative capabilities, and unique place in the culture give me great confidence we will continue to define entertainment for the next 100 years,\" he said. How streaming services left us with too much to watch\nEncanto director's awe for glasses hero schoolgirl However, even as Disney+ subscribers jumped, executives warned that revenue from cinema releases has yet to recover. In contrast, sales at Disney's US amusement parks hit a record in the last three months of 2021. Overall, the company's revenues rose by 34% year-on-year to $21.8bn (£16.1bn) for the quarter, while profits surged to $1.1bn. Sophie Lund-Yates, equity analyst at Hargreaves Lansdown, said Disney's parks were \"doing much better than feared, despite ongoing Covid fears\". \"Getting customers through the gates is one thing, but being able to sell them mountains of branded food, toys and gifts is what truly makes Disney a remarkable business,\" she added. \"It's impossible not to be impressed by recent growth in Disney's streaming subscriptions. However, the market cares a great deal about the streaming business, and churning out the levels of growth expected is only going to become a more difficult task. \"If you didn't get a Disney+ subscription while trying to home-school in lockdowns, chances are you may never get one.\" Separately, ride-hailing giant Uber announced that taxi bookings had rebounded, as people start to put pandemic constraints behind them. Chief executive Dara Khosrowshahi said his firm's gains showed \"just how far we've come since the start of the pandemic\". Uber said overall revenues jumped 83% to $5.8bn, with profits of $892m. Shares in both companies rose in after-hours trade in New York. ",

            "content": "Openreach is to create 4,000 jobs this year as part of its plans to expand its full-fibre broadband across the UK. The company said the new roles, which include 3,000 apprenticeships, would help its bid to reach 25 million homes and businesses by the end of 2026. But the recruitment drive comes amid strong competition for workers, which has seen firms pay more for new staff. A report found starting salaries were rising due to a scarcity of candidates in the UK labour market. The Recruitment and Employment Confederation (REC) and consultancy firm KPMG said a survey of 400 recruitment agencies suggested demand for staff was continuing to grow after the easing of pandemic restrictions. Openreach's hiring spree comes after the company, which is owned by BT, recruited 2,500 people for engineering jobs last year, of which 600 trainee engineers were women. The company employs 35,000 people and said it was committed to building a more diverse workforce. It has previously consulted language experts to make sure job adverts are gender neutral. Clive Selley, chief executive of Openreach, said the company had built training schools \"all over the country where we can teach people the skills and techniques they need for long, exciting and rewarding careers in engineering\". \"We want to reflect the communities we serve and give opportunities to people from all backgrounds, so I'm encouraged that we've recruited more women and minority groups this year compared to last year, but we've got much more to do in an industry that hasn't been very diverse historically,\" he added. Openreach's £12bn broadband expansion project has been accelerated in part due to the coronavirus pandemic. The government previously estimated that with a full-fibre optic broadband network available, nearly two million more people than previously calculated could choose to work from home in the long term, reducing transport and housing pressures in big cities and boosting local and rural economies. Many firms are struggling to recruit workers, with vacancies at a record high of 1.2 million. According to the director of the Institute for Employment Studies, the pandemic has caused the UK labour market to shrink. Openreach said told the BBC it had not increased its salaries despite the increase in inflation, but said a pay review was coming up in April. It said new trainee engineers start on £21,845 per year and recruits can earn up to £28,353 after 12 months of specialist training. Openreach also plans to retrain more than 3,000 of its existing engineers during the next year to move on from fixing older, copper-based technologies, to installing and maintaining fibre connections.

            "content": "With Covid vaccination rules for travellers due to ease this week the travel industry is preparing for the return of summer holidays abroad. The pandemic forced job losses across the industry so how are employers and job hunters feeling about the future of aviation? To deal with the expected rise in demand London Stansted has hosted its first in-person jobs fair for more than two years, with the Essex airport looking to fill about 300 roles. It's in stark contrast to October 2020 when the company announced 376 job losses after the \"toughest summer ever\". Airlines, baggage handlers and plane cleaning companies are all keen to get recruiting and get a head start on what they hope will be a bumper year. For job hunters it's all about getting back into an industry that's been largely off limits for two years. Billy Green was training to be a pilot when the pandemic hit and the aviation industry ground to a halt. \"I was training to be a pilot but due to Covid and job losses it wasn't feasible at the time. I'm now looking to get back into the airport, back into aviation which is something I've wanted to do since I was young,\" he says. \"It's great to see the opportunities at the airport now - not just in the skies, but on the ground as well.\" Mr Green says his dream is still to be a pilot, but for now it's a longer-term goal. \"I would like to get back to it in the next five years. But for now it's about finding a job and learning about different areas of the airport.\" Ella Blayney has been studying the industry for three years and says she is surprised at how many jobs are on offer. \"I'm looking for a permanent job in aviation; I've been studying about it for three years so I'm looking to get into it,\" she says. \"There is more than I thought there was; stuff I hadn't even heard of, which is really encouraging; they need hundreds of people.\" Stansted would normally handle about 28 million passengers a year, but Covid-19 restrictions led to just 7,543,779 million using it in 2020. They are optimistic about the future and, with 90,000 passengers expected this weekend, they hope to reach pre-pandemic levels for the summer. The airport's people director, Liz Austin, says they're looking to \"recruit early and get ahead of the game\" and hire everyone from engineering technicians to security staff and cleaners. \"The pandemic has impacted the industry like no other; we had to make some really difficult decisions and unfortunately we did have a lot of people who did choose to leave us through voluntary redundancy,\" she says. She acknowledges that it is a tough labour market with lots of jobs on offer and says the airport is \"having to work incredibly hard to attract people into the sector\". However, despite the challenges Ms Austin believes it's an \"exciting time\" to get back into the airport. For the airport's partners it's a similarly sunny outlook. Craig Ellis, from the airline cleaning service Up and Away, says there has been a lot of interest in the 16 roles his company is offering. \"We're going to be extremely busy this summer and with the footfall today I'm confident we'll get the extra staff,\" he says. \"Last year was very solemn; the industry has been affected heavily by Covid, but the footfall here today paints a picture that the recovery is coming.\" Similarly, airlines are preparing for a boom with Ryanair hoping to take on about 200 new staff, including cabin crew, in March. Lauren Dixon, the airline's UK recruitment manager, says the six courses to train those new staff in March is just the beginning, with hundreds of staff a month expected to be recruited. \"The pandemic has 100% knocked people out industry a lot of people have lost confidence in aviation,\" she says. \"We're 100% full steam ahead and looking for people to join us as soon as possible. \"There are always going to be difficulties but we just have to power through.\" Find BBC News: East of England on Facebook, Instagram and Twitter.

            "content": "Prices in the US soared 7% last year - the biggest annual increase in nearly four decades. Now US consumers - whose spending powers the world's largest economy - are starting to signal they have had enough. \"I find now, that I'm constantly tracking the cost of certain items,\" Sevan Tavoukdjian says. \"It's changed which items I buy.\" The 34-year-old actor moved into his own apartment in New York City last month and when he saw how much it would cost to furnish it, he was shocked at the prices being charged. So, he scrapped plans to buy furniture and instead sent a message to his neighbourhood “Buy Nothing” Facebook group, where people offer unwanted items for free. “I thought, 'I’m going to go broke just buying the basic necessities',\" he says. “I would have loved to buy a new couch, but the prices are like, ‘Well – No’.” The thrifty savers attempting a No Spend January\nSurging food prices push UK inflation to 30-year high\nUS prices rise at fastest rate in nearly 40 years\nSeven reasons living costs are rising around the world The average American family had to spend roughly $3,500 (£2,600) more last year than in 2020 for the same goods and services due to inflation, according to researchers at the Penn Wharton Budget Model at the University of Pennsylvania's Wharton School. Housing costs were up 4.2%, grocery bills jumped 6.3% and clothing prices were 5.8% higher. Living and dining furniture - like Mr Tavoukdjian was seeking - saw one of the biggest spikes, rising more than 17%. But salaries have not kept up with the increases, pushing people to forego purchases, substitute cheaper alternatives, or - like Sevan - hunt for something free. The situation has driven a surge in activity on neighbourhood exchanges such as the Buy Nothing Project, the group Mr Tavoukdjian turned to when he wanted to furnish his apartment, building on growth since the start of the pandemic. Membership in the group has more than doubled over the past two years to more than 5.3 million globally. It recently added an app to cope with demand. At Freecycle, a similar site where participants typically offer up some 20,000 items each day, the number of posts each day has increased by about 15% in recent months, driven by the financial concerns, founder, Deron Beal says. \"People, understandably, they're buying petrol or going to the store and seeing high prices...seek to pinch their pennies a little bit and Freecycle... is a good alternative,\" he says. Even families with higher incomes, who might ordinarily be insulated from the pressures, are reconsidering their ordinary spending, says Tania Brown, a financial planner based in Georgia, with more than 20 years' experience. “There is an across-the-board sense of worry about inflation: ‘How long is this going to last, how this is going to impact their daily life',” she says. “I am definitely hearing differences and changes.” The squeeze contributed to a pullback in consumer spending in December - a deceleration that is likely to continue, says Kathy Bostjancic, chief US financial economist at Oxford Economics. Her firm expects consumer spending growth of around 3.5% this year – still strong, but a marked slowdown from last year’s massive 8% gain, not including inflation. “Consumers, both out of price 'sticker shock', and also frustration that the… choices they have available are so lean, have decided to make alternative choices – whether that’s not to buy at all, or find a second-hand couch,” she says. Given the mix of factors driving inflation - supply chain hold-ups, labour shortages, government stimulus and more - it's hard to say when households will get some relief from falling prices, if demand wanes, says economist Zheli He, who worked on the Penn Wharton Budget Model research. Purchases of some hard-to-substitute items, such as petrol, have kept rising despite dramatic price gains, she says. \"People just have to spend on them [hard-to-swap items] so the higher prices will just drive up their cost of living,\" she says. Mr Tavoukdjian, who has been grappling with cuts to his hours teaching as an adjunct literature professor, says he's been amazed by what people are offering in his local Buy Nothing group: everything from never-been-used pillows and plates, to hand-me-down children's toys and clothes - and sometimes more off-beat items such as breast milk. His own plea for help was amply answered. Within days, he had transformed his bare-bones New York City studio into a home, adding five chairs, two small tables, two lamps, a sofa, rug, microwave, toaster, several sets of dishes, paintings and half a dozen throw pillows. But the shock of the prices from his initial search has lingered. When his vacuum cleaner broke recently, he didn't pull out his wallet for a new one. He headed to Buy Nothing for help. “They’ve made a massive difference,” he says. “It’s amazing what’s out there.” Are you affected by issues covered in this story?

The Edinburgh-based company works with airlines and airports in 37 countries. It said the offer from National Aviation Services was the second unsolicited approach and was \"highly opportunistic\". A statement responding to a rise in the offer price from £423m, said the takeover attempt did not take account of the firm's post-pandemic recovery. It also highlighted measures taken by Menzies management to cut costs and become more efficient. It claims to be on course for £80m of additional annual revenue, with more in the medium term. The company cut more than 17,500 jobs worldwide in March 2020 because of the downturn in air travel due to the pandemic. National Aviation Services is a subsidiary of the Kuwait-based logistics conglomerate Agility. Philipp Joeinig, John Menzies' chairman and chief executive, said: \"The board has unanimously rejected this unsolicited and highly opportunistic proposal, which we believe does not reflect Menzies' true intrinsic business worth or its prospects. \"Menzies continues to make good progress with strong performance across a number of service lines, which together with productivity gains, saw the group to finish last year strongly. \"This strong performance and momentum in 2021 has continued in 2022 with further contract wins and renewals alongside the continued recovery of global flight volumes.\" John Menzies was founded in 1833. It grew as a bookseller and one of Britain's biggest newspaper distributors, expanding into air freight from 1987. In 2018, it sold off the distribution business to focus on aviation services.

It said it would reduce the number of journeys by lorries carrying earth. Buckinghamshire Council said it was looking at what planning applications would need to be submitted. HS2 is a project to create better rail links between London and other major cities that would cut journey times and increase capacity. The council said HS2 Ltd wanted to install the conveyer belt near Small Dean as part of its \"mass haul strategy\" to move earth from the Small Dean Viaduct launch compound, across the A413 London Road and the rail line over to Small Dean Lane.

It would be used for two years with an aim to \"drastically reduce the number of truck movements on the A413\", the council said. Without the conveyor, there would be an estimated 200 lorries per day over a period of three and half years. Buckinghamshire Council said as well as investigating what planning applications would need to be submitted it would also be \"seeking reassurances, from HS2 and its contractors, that any impacts on the community, such as light and noise, are minimised\". HS2 Ltd said cuttings were planned for the area south of the A413 and the material excavated needs to be moved north to help form embankments and noise barriers elsewhere on the route. Senior project manager, Patrick Dineen, said HS2 was \"committed to cutting the amount of embedded carbon in construction and working to reduce the number of lorries on local roads\". \"The fully-enclosed 600m long conveyor will avoid the need to transport excavated material on the public road network,\" he said. \"In total, the conveyor is expected to shift the equivalent of 58,000 lorry loads of material during construction, helping to reduce disruption for the community and other road users.\" Find BBC News: East of England on Facebook, Instagram and Twitter.

            "content": "Mutual insurers LV= and Royal London have walked away from talks over a possible merger. LV=, formerly known as Liverpool Victoria, said a marriage would not be in the best interests of its members. Royal London hinted that it had been misled into thinking that LV= did not have a viable future on its own. It is the latest in a tumultuous few months for LV=, after its 1.2 million members rejected a takeover by US private equity firm, Bain Capital. Mutuals are owned by, and for, their members. There was considerable public and political debate when the leadership at LV= favoured the Bain Capital takeover - a move that would have led to it losing its mutual status 178 years after it was founded. In December, it was announced that after a vote, the sale did not get enough support from members. LV= members reject sale to US private equity firm Discussions about a merger with another mutual insurer - Royal London - began shortly afterwards, but on Wednesday both sides said these had come to an end. LV= said a deal would not be possible because \"our different mutual models mean such a merger would not be in the best interests of LV= members.\" The company added it was in a healthy financial position, having previously stated that without a deal with Bain Capital it would struggle to survive. Seamus Creedon, LV= interim chair, said: \"We thank Royal London for its engagement and we look forward to operating alongside it as part of a vibrant mutual sector. \"The strength of LV='s business performance over the past 18 months combined with its operational progress has strengthened the board's belief in, and commitment to, the continuation of our status as an independent mutual. We have heard what our members have said about the importance of mutuality and the continuation of the LV= brand.\" After these latest talks ended, Royal London's chief executive Barry O'Dwyer said: \"Mutuals are owned by their customers and are run for their benefit. \"Our offer to preserve LV='s mutuality through a merger with Royal London was based on an understanding that LV= did not have a viable future as an independent company.\" LV=, originally founded to cover the funeral costs of Liverpool's poor, attracted a number of bids when it had first proposed a sale of the business, including from Royal London. On Monday, it announced that its chairman Alan Cook was standing down, as part of wider boardroom reshuffle. ",

            "header": "Global chip shortage: Toyota profits fall as production hit",
            "content": "Japanese motor industry giant Toyota saw its profits fall by 21% for the last three months of 2021 as the global chip shortage hit production. The company said that its third quarter operating profit came in at 784.4bn yen (£5bn; $6.8bn). The world's best-selling carmaker also cut its annual production target by 500,000 vehicles to 8.5 million. It comes as manufacturers around the world are struggling to find enough microprocessors for their products. \"We sincerely apologise for the inconvenience caused to our customers due to the series of production volume reductions since last summer. We are working to restore full production as soon as possible,\" Toyota said in a statement. In September, Toyota slashed its worldwide vehicle production by 40% because of the chip shortage. The company has also announced a number of production suspensions in recent months due to a lack of parts as the pandemic hits supply chains. Rival carmakers including Volkswagen, General Motors, Ford, Nissan, Daimler, BMW and Renault have also cut vehicle production in recent months. \"The chip shortage will still weigh on Toyota in 2022 but they'll likely manage any challenges better than their peers,\" Tu Le, managing director of Sino Auto Insights told the BBC. \"I think they actually see opportunity in crisis because of their confidence in managing the shortages better than GM and VW. So relatively, I see Toyota having a strong year relative to their competitors,\" he added. Last month, Toyota cemented its position as the world's biggest car seller as it widened its lead over nearest rival VW. Toyota extends Japan car production stoppages\nToyota to cut production by 40% amid chip crisis Separately, in January Toyota warned customers in Japan that they would have to wait for up to four years to take delivery of its new Land Cruiser SUV. The firm said the delay was not related to the global chip shortage or the supply chain crisis. However, it refused to comment on the reasons behind the long delivery time. Launched in 1951, the Land Cruiser is Toyota's longest-selling vehicle, with a total of 10.6 million sold as of August last year. The pandemic saw a surge in demand for consumer electronics and medical devices, which all contain computer chips. That meant there weren't enough semiconductors left for carmakers. When the global chip shortage first hit the motor industry early last year Toyota was relatively well prepared compared to its rivals. It had faced a similar issue in the wake of an earthquake and tsunami a decade earlier. Back then, chip-making factories were damaged, which meant major production disruptions for Toyota and other carmakers. Toyota reviewed its supply chain and started stockpiling. That meant it had enough semiconductors to last for months. But as the pandemic dragged on, those stocks are running low and the company now expects to miss its global production target. And analysts predict the chip shortage could last until next year. There is some good news though. In recent months, there have been major investments in plants specifically to manufacture chips for the motor industry. Before the pandemic that hadn't been seen as a priority. Chipmakers are now battling to win customers in the auto sector after the semiconductor shortage highlighted the size of the market, especially as the growing electric vehicle (EV) industry calls for even more advanced technology. When it comes to EVs, Toyota is trailing many of its rivals after having long-focussed on hybrids. While hybrids are still more popular in emerging markets, demand for EVs is growing in the larger economies of the US, China and Europe. So along with overcoming the chip shortage, Toyota also needs to catch up with its rivals in the EV market if it wants to retain its title as the world's best-selling car maker. ",

            "header": "Rental costs jump as workers return to the office",
            "content": "The cost of renting a property in a city centre is rising as office workers, students and international residents return, according to Zoopla. The property portal said greater competition meant that renters taking on a new let were paying £62 more a month than they did pre-pandemic. This higher demand is set to ease in the coming months, in part owing to the rising cost of living facing renters. Another survey suggests interest in new office space has risen in recent weeks. First-time buyers rise: 'I couldn't keep paying rent' Demand for city-centre properties to rent dropped dramatically, particularly in London, during the pandemic lockdowns. Many students and young workers who were working from home returned to live with their parents, and international travel restrictions reduced medium-term overseas visitors. Zoopla said that the gradual return to the office, and well as the general winding down of Covid restrictions, had boosted the rental market. It said demand for rental properties in January was up 76% compared to an average January in each of the previous four years. \"The flooding of rental demand back into city centres thanks to office workers, students and international demand returning to cities means the post-pandemic recalibration of the rental market is well underway,\" said Grainne Gilmore, head of research at Zoopla. The number of properties available had been curtailed by existing renters staying put. Together, this has meant a rise in rent for new lets, up 8.3% in the final quarter of 2021 compared with the same period a year earlier. A typical monthly rent in the UK rose by £62 per month to £969. This increae in rent was seen across most major cities including Birmingham, Edinburgh, Leeds and Manchester, Zoopla said. \"Rents have risen sharply in recent months, amid a backdrop of rising living costs. But it is important to point out that in terms of rental affordability, in most markets rents are still close to the 10-year average,\" Ms Gilmore said. The average rent accounts for 37% of gross income for a single earner. Ms Gilmore added that demand would ease as the cost of living squeeze became more of an issue. Many renters who want to buy a home have been frustrated by rising house prices, and any pressure on the cost of renting would be unwelcome for them. The plight of first-time buyers has been the topic of sharp debate in recent days after the broadcaster Kirstie Allsopp suggested young people would be better placed to afford a property if they quit Netflix, gym memberships and coffee. Those comments in a national newspaper at the weekend prompted a furious backlash from many on social media, although some supported her views. In terms of buyers, another property listing website Rightmove recently suggested that there had been a long-term shift with buyers willing to pay more for space and privacy. That has meant some demand transferring from city centre to out-of-town living in some cases. Rightmove also said on Wednesday that business owners enquiring about leasing office space surpassed pre-pandemic levels in January. It said enquiries were 54% higher than in January 2021 and 15% higher than the same point in 2019, before the pandemic. ",

            "header": "Prepayment energy customers feeling the strain",
            "content": "Pay-as-you-go customers are already going without gas and electricity in greater numbers ahead of big price rises, an energy supply boss has said. Bill Bullen, chief executive of Utilita, said twice the usual number of prepayment meter customers were \"self-disconnecting\" when accounts ran dry. These customers typically face a £708 a year increase in their bill from April, a bigger rise than other households. Mr Bullen said a \"big proportion\" would be unable to pay. \"It's going to be tough on an awful lot of families,\" he said. He called for specific help for seven or eight million households who were going to be really stretched rather than the government's plan to \"subsidise everyone's energy consumption\". Utilita is the leading prepayment energy supplier, with 827,000 customers. Mr Bullen told the BBC that typically at this time of year, about 2 or 3% of these customers would \"self-disconnect\", running out of money, but that now stands between 5 and 7%. Prepayment meters require customers to pay for their energy use in advance, often online, but also from credit bought in convenience stores. From April, the typical domestic energy bill for 4.5 million prepayment meter customers - often the poorest in society - will go up by £708 a year to a total of £2,017, under the regulator's price cap. Jennifer Quigley is a prepayment meter customer and has found her top-ups are not going nearly as far. The idea costs could rise more are bringing on a feeling of panic. \"When £10 would've lasted you four or five days, now it's only lasting two or three,\" she said. \"It's difficult to budget because the changes happen so often. When you're counting pennies and pounds it makes a big difference.\" A few years ago, she got into hot water with her credit card bills. At that time, she found the meter useful to help her plan her spending. Now she feels trapped. \"People say shop around, but when you're on prepayment it's not that easy,\" she said. \"As soon as a company sees you're on a prepayment they go 'oh right well we can't offer you this or that'. It's not any better.\" The bill for typical usage on a prepayment meter from April, under the price cap will be £46 more a year than those who pay for their gas and electricity by direct debit. The rise in April is also £15 higher than the £693 rise for the 18 million households not on prepayment meters. Energy regulator Ofgem's chief executive, Jonathan Brearley, defended the difference in prices. \"Our job is to make sure what the cost is reflected fairly in the bill,\" he said. \"Prepayment customers do have infrastructure that other customers don't use,\" he said. \"The cost of serving those customers is higher and that's why unfortunately prepayment customers pay more.\" When a prepayment meter runs out of credit, most suppliers include a function to add emergency funds. This amount - typically between £5 and £10 - is automatically added by the customer and repaid as they top up. It means someone's supply should never be cut off, but can also mean they rack up debt. There are additional voucher schemes in place already that hard-up households can apply for further emergency funding when they cannot afford their bills. Auriga Services is a private business that provides these vouchers for some suppliers. They have seen demand for vouchers increase 800%, from 1,634 in March 2020 to 14,663 a year later. British Gas has the highest number of prepayment customers in the UK and they told the BBC they have given out 1,800 Emergency Utility Vouchers this winter. The company's Winter Fund, for those in fuel poverty, still has £1.7m unused for this year and they are urging their customers to contact them if they need help. The BBC also contacted E.ON, EDF, Ovo-SSE, Octopus and Shell Energy, who have similar emergency credit schemes or funding set aside for customers. All said customers should talk to their supplier if they were worried about their bills. Sunak defends response as energy bills soar by £693\nEnergy price rise includes £68 for failed firms A spokesperson for HM Treasury said: \"We understand that people are concerned about pressures on household budgets which is why the chancellor announced a £9bn package to protect millions against the impact of rising global energy prices.\" Chancellor Rishi Sunak unveiled plans to support households, with a £200 reduction, given in October and repaid in instalments from April 2023, as well as an additional £150 council tax rebate for properties in bands A to D in England. However, the the Institute of Fiscal Studies think-tank described the support as \"broad based\", adding that there was \"little direct targeting of resources on the poorest and those most in need\". Mr Bullen, of Utilita, said the package of measures was not targeted enough, and also failed to recognise specific complications with his customers. \"Customers move house, particularly in the rented sector. You are potentially getting one person seeing the benefit of the £200 subsidy putting the debt on the prepayment meter, and if you change the tenancy someone else ends up picking up the tab,\" he said. The Treasury described the policy package as \"progressive overall\" and said that it would benefit lower-income households the most when it comes to a proportion of their household income.

            "header": "Peloton boss John Foley to step down as firm axes 2,800 jobs",
            "content": "The co-founder of exercise brand Peloton is to step down from leading the company as it plans to cut thousands of jobs. John Foley, chief executive of the firm for 10 years, will be replaced by Barry McCarthy, the former chief financial officer of Spotify. Despite the change, one of Peloton's biggest investors doubled down on its calls for the company to be sold. Amazon, Nike and Apple are rumoured to be interested in bidding for the firm. The company, which pairs its equipment with streaming and live exercise classes, had seen sales of its bikes and treadmills soar during the pandemic, but the post-lockdown return to gyms has left the firm worth less than a fifth of its peak $50bn valuation. Mr Foley said Mr McCarthy was the \"right leader to take the company into its next phase of growth\". Mr Foley will become Peloton's executive chairman. After announcing the change in leadership, US-based Peloton also said it will cut about 2,800 jobs globally due to a drop in demand for its products. Shares in the firm jumped by as much as 19% on the New York Stock Exchange on Tuesday. But one of Peloton's top investors, Blackwells Capital, which owns a near 5% stake in the company, said the changes did not address the concerns of investors and renewed its calls from last month for the company to be sold. \"Mr Foley has proven he is not suited to lead Peloton, whether as CEO or executive chair, and he should not be hand-picking directors, as he appears to have done today,\" added Jason Aintabi, chief investment officer at Blackwells. In a presentation sent by Blackwells to Peloton on Monday, the investment firm said the company had been \"horribly mismanaged, with unbridled enthusiasm taking the place of disciplined leadership\". The presentation attacked Mr Foley's abilities as a leader, saying he had made \"a series of poor decisions relating to product, pricing, demand, safety and capital allocation\". Blackwells has previously said Peloton and its customer base were \"extremely attractive\" to companies such as Nike, Apple, Disney and Sony, which are looking to boost their presence in the home, health and wellness sectors. Mr Foley told The Wall Street Journal, that the company was \"open to exploring any opportunity that could create value for Peloton shareholders\" but declined to comment further. Analysts at Wedbush Securities said that the leadership change made it more likely that Peloton would ultimately be sold. \"If a bidding process begins, we view Apple as the likely acquirer due to the clear strategic fit with its healthcare/fitness/subscription initiatives, while Amazon and Nike among others could be potential bidders in the mix,\" they added. \"The reality is that Foley was the pilot on the Peloton growth plane and him leaving paints a bleak picture with the main visionary no longer in charge.\" Analysts have estimated that Peloton could be valued between $12bn and $15bn, depending on timing and the competition. Setting out its plans to cut costs on Tuesday, Peloton said along with worker cuts, around 20% of its corporate staff would made redundant. Mr Foley said the decision was \"not taken lightly\". The company expects its restructuring programme to cost about $130m, which will be related to severance packages. The company also said it was \"winding down\" the development of the Peloton Output Park - a factory in Ohio where it had hoped to make its exercise equipment and create 2,000 jobs. Shelving the plant will cost $60m. Peloton reported its \"connected fitness\" subscriptions in the second quarter of its financial year grew by 66% from a year earlier, while its paid digital members rose 38%. Total revenue in the quarter grew 6% to $1.1bn. The company, which previously expected sales of $4.4bn to $4.8bn this financial year, has revised down its forecast to $3.7bn to $3.8bn. Aside from demand falling for its products, there have also been recent PR disasters for the company, including when TV characters had heart attacks when using Peloton machines. A fictional character in the Sex and the City reboot And Just Like That died of a heart attack using a Peloton machine, and there was also a brush with death in Billions. After the And Just Like That death, Peloton tried to recover the PR narrative with a parody advert featuring Chris Noth alive and well, and benefitting from exercise. But that backfired after allegations of sexual assault, which he denied. Meanwhile in August the US Department of Justice and the Department of Homeland Security said they were investigating the company after a child was pulled under one of its treadmills and killed, while other customers had reported injuries. Weeks after the reports, Peloton recalled 125,000 of its Tread+ running machines after initially saying there was \"no reason\" to stop using the machine before changing its stance. ",

            "header": "BP hits back at calls for windfall tax on bumper profits",
            "content": "Oil giant BP has rejected calls for a windfall tax on energy companies' bumper profits, saying it would reduce investment in UK gas and renewables. BP posted a profit of $12.8bn (£9.5bn) for 2021 after oil and gas prices surged in the second half of the year. That has prompted calls for a one-off tax to help support families struggling to pay their energy bills. Labour said it was \"only fair and right\" that energy firms making higher profits should pay more tax. But BP said: \"Generally, a windfall tax on UK oil and gas producers would not encourage investment in producing the UK's gas resources. \"Very importantly, we also believe the UK should continue its [low carbon] energy transition as fast as possible. BP is committed to playing our part here,\" a company spokesperson said. Last week, rival oil giant Shell also reported profits of $19bn on the same day that the energy regulator Ofgem announced UK householders would see a 54% rise in their domestic energy bills in April. That has prompted criticism that energy firms are raking in excess profits on the back of fuel poverty and \"creeping climate apocalypse\". But the oil giants argue they are facing an unprecedented challenge: while the global economy remains heavily dependent on fossil fuels, they are being urged to shift to lower carbon alternatives, and need big profits to fund that transition. Sunak defends response as energy bills soar by £693\nPetrol prices: Are we paying too much at the pump?\nWatch: Government 'sided with oil and gas companies' BP said over this decade the firm planned to invest more than twice what it made in Britain, the \"great majority\" in offshore wind, solar, hydrogen, carbon capture and storage and electric vehicle charging. BP has moved further than many of its rivals, outlining a plan to increase its renewable power capacity 20-fold by 2030 and reduce its oil output by 40%, or more than 1 million barrels per day. The strong results showed BP was doing what it had promised: \"performing while transforming\" BP chief executive Bernard Looney said. A windfall tax is a one-off tax imposed by a government on a company or group of companies. The idea is to target firms that were lucky enough to benefit from something they were not responsible for - in other words, a windfall. An example of such a windfall would be high energy prices. Companies that get oil and gas out of the ground are getting much more money for it than they were last year, largely because there has been so much more demand as the world emerges from the pandemic. Read more about windfall taxes here Last year's profit compares to a $5.7bn loss BP reported in 2020, when economies around the world were shut down due to the Covid pandemic. But rising demand for oil last year, as economies reopened, combined with supply chain challenges, pushed energy prices sharply higher by the end of 2021. The surge in revenues prompted Mr Looney to describe BP as \"a cash machine\", with profits reaching more than $4bn in the final quarter. Those profits come at a particularly sensitive time with UK households facing a cost of living crisis, which has already prompted the government to step in with a council tax rebate and loans to smooth the coming rise in domestic energy prices. The Treasury said it would not comment on speculation over tax changes but pointed out that oil and gas firms' profits are already taxed at a higher rate than other businesses. \"A windfall tax could deter £14bn worth of opportunities awaiting investment, which would risk both security of our energy supply, as well as almost 200,000 jobs that rely on the industry,\" a Treasury spokesperson said. The same high energy prices that are delivering crushing bills to households are seeing profits at companies like BP and Shell balloon. It seems like a no-brainer to tax one to solve the other. Both Conservative and Labour governments have imposed windfall taxes before. But government officials and industry experts insist it's not that simple. BP and Shell's operations in UK waters have dwindled and they already pay double the tax rate of other businesses on UK-based profits. Taxing them on overseas revenues is problematic as they already pay in the countries in which they operate. Previous windfall taxes have generally been on companies with predominantly UK based operations. Even if you could design a mechanism to do it, the government is adamant that it would deter investment in securing the best yield from domestic fossil fuel reserves and be a raid on money that could be used to build or buy wind farms, generate hydrogen or install more electric car charging points. Sceptics would say big payouts to shareholders dent the credibility of that, but others say shareholders are primarily pension funds so a windfall tax would be hitting savers. Whatever the merits of the arguments, with profits at Shell and BP set to rise significantly again this year as gas and oil prices stay high, it's unlikely calls for a windfall tax will go away. However Labour and the Liberal Democrats have both called for a windfall tax on the profits of firms such as BP and Shell to fund more support for households. \"The boss of BP described the energy price crisis as a cash machine for his company - and the people supplying the cash are the British people through rocketing energy bills,\" said Ed Miliband, Labour's shadow secretary of state for climate and net zero. \"In these circumstances, it is only fair and right for oil and gas producers to contribute to helping the millions of families facing soaring inflation and a cost of living crisis.\" Under a plan outlined by Labour last month, North Sea energy producers would pay higher corporation tax for a year to fund £1.2bn of help for households. Liberal Democrat Leader Ed Davey said: \"It simply cannot be right these energy companies are making super profits whilst people are too scared to turn their radiators on and terrified there will be a cold snap. \"A windfall tax is the best way to get money to the people who need it quickly, but also to make sure there is some sense of trust and proportionality in the system.\" Only a fraction of BP's profits are generated in the North Sea, however, so a windfall tax applied only to those operations would raise limited revenue, while applying an additional tax to the firm's global profits might be more difficult to execute. Former BP executive Nick Butler said what mattered most was not how much money the oil giants were making but how they chose to spend those profits. \"What society needs now is both the transition to low carbon and energy security,\" he told the BBC's Today programme. \"We need to invest in oil and gas because 80% of all the energy we use every day is oil and gas, and we need companies like BP and Shell investing in that supply to ensure volatility of the world market is mitigated.\" ",

Tynwald are due to be asked to back a £1.25 rise to £9.50 per hour. Chamber president Kristan McDonald said it would have a \"knock-on effect for proportionate wage rises across the board\" for many firms. The government previously said the rise was needed for the island to remain competitive. The proposed changes would also see the 16 and 17-year-olds' minimum pay go up from £6.15 to £6.80 per hour, and rates for development workers rise from £7.30 to £8.05. A recent survey of island businesses showed about 24% felt the timeline for the implementation of the April rise gave them enough time to adapt, while 49% said it did not. Mr McDonald said combined with inflationary pressures, it would leave the majority of firms with \"no choice other than to push the 13% rise on to the consumer\". \"It's clear that many feel that they have had very little time to respond to the financial impact this increase will have,\" he added. \"A phased implementation would give businesses more time to adapt.\" The island's minimum wage has remained static since 2019. In 2021, Tynwald members supported bringing it into line with the £10.87 Living Wage rate within five years. Announcing the proposed rise in January, Treasury Minister David Ashford said since that vote, the island had \"seen a dramatic increase in cost of living, alongside unprecedented low levels of unemployment\", which meant there was already \"upward pressure\" on wages above the legal requirement. The government had \"endeavoured to strike a balance between the needs of employers and the needs of our working population, alongside supporting the position of our island as a progressive, diverse and attractive destination\", he added.

Janice Hall said she also uses a centre in Wythenshawe, Manchester, \"to get a main meal\" as her bills have increased. The 48-year-old said the situation had left her \"crying for help\". A rise in the energy price cap means about 18 million UK households will pay an extra £693 a year from April.

Ms Hall, who is from Wythenshawe, told BBC North West Tonight that her condition meant she had to \"have the heating on, especially in winter\". She said that was the reason she had to travel to Crossacres Day Centre three times a week. \"I am crying for help,\" she added. \"It is not fair.\" Mavis Irving, who also goes to the centre regularly, said she feared the energy price rise as \"things are hard enough as it is\". \"Everything you buy regularly has gone up and when you go to the till, you get a shock,\" she said.

The increase in bills is not just hitting households but businesses are also seeing their costs rise. What are companies doing and will their customers also see their prices go up?

He says: \"We're trying to juggle all these increases, whether it's on the fuel, electricity, especially from the suppliers, were getting constant increases from the suppliers. \"So we're having to look at all aspects of the business to try and counteract some of the increases that are coming our way. \"We have had to pass some increases on to the customers because we can't sustain it any more.\" Mr Hammond says the situation is \"very tough\" for businesses. \"With the pandemic and now these increases that are coming in, it seems as if it's never-ending at the moment so we're trying to keep morale high in the workforce.\" He says the company will be looking at \"little things within the business that we think we can reduce even just a few percent which will help but we're running out ideas to try and reduce our costs\". \"I just think we've all got to work hard and accept it,\" he adds. Subsea Protection Systems, a specialist concrete company, operates across the UK and is based in Great Yarmouth. Stuart Gibbs, its finance director, says: \"The costs since Brexit and Covid and just everywhere have really gone up quite badly. \"We've seen concrete go up, timber, our rope... obviously with energy bills going up in the future that's going to put on even more pressure and prices will rise again. \"It's very difficult because margins are slashed quite dramatically and sometimes we're making loses and sometimes we've got to just pass it on to clients, which can lead us to lose some work from that.\" He says the government could not have introduced the planned rise in National Insurance in April to help businesses, and provide \"more help for the energy [costs] and help across the board\". \"Businesses can't cope, it's getting to the stage where a lot of them will be going under because of this,\" he adds. Tom Kimber-Smith, manager at Great Yarmouth firm Lion Engineering, says their work is picking up since the pandemic but they are \"seeing astronomical costs\". \"It's a problem but it's a good problem to have, during the pandemic it was bad problem with not enough work and having to let people go,\" he says. But he says the business is \"struggling with increased costs, with energy bills, raw material, consumables, we're trying not to pass this on to the customer and that's a fight we're having every day\". \"To become competitive in the market that we're in is very difficult, we're trying to swallow as much costs as we can with the understanding eventually we'll have to pass this on,\" he says. Mr Kimber-Smith says: \"It's very disheartening, our customers are all in the same position as us. \"It's definitely going to get harder over the next 12 months and I can only see this getting worse. \"I can't see what the answer is, let's just try and survive and get through the next 12 months.\" Find BBC News: East of England on Facebook, Instagram and Twitter.

            "content": "The US and Japan have agreed to remove Trump-era tariffs from around 1.25 million metric tonnes a year of Japanese steel imports. Under the deal, Japan says it will help to tackle excess steel supplies, which push down prices. The agreement is aimed to stamp out \"unfair practices\" in the global steel industry, which is dominated by China. The Biden administration has already made a similar deal with the EU but tariffs remain in place on UK imports. The agreement with Japan, which takes effect on 1 April \"will further help us rebuild relationships with our allies around the world as we work to fight against China's unfair trade practices,\" US Commerce Secretary Gina Raimondo said. During Donald Trump's presidency Washington imposed tariffs on a number of countries, citing cheap metal imports as a national security threat. Under the new deal, the US will stop charging a 25% levy on Japanese steel imports, excluding aluminium, up to a 1.25m metric tonne annual threshold. Meanwhile, Tokyo said it will take steps within six months to support what the US and Japan see as a fairer steel market. These include taxing goods believed to be priced below market value, and a levy to offset subsidies that an exporter has received. US will remove steel tariffs 'when time is right'\nUK steel future uncertain without US tariffs deal The announcement was cautiously welcomed by investment experts. \"This lifting of Trump-era tariffs on steel is consistent with expectations that the Biden administration would align its geo-political and trade alliances,\" Vishnu Varathan, head of economics and strategy at Mizuho Bank, told the BBC. \"However, the reality is that even the initial tariffs did not impact China too badly. So, this deal may really be more about reparations of relations in a longer trade game,\" he added. On 1 January, a deal between the Brussels and Washington took effect which allows tariff-free exports of EU steel and aluminium to the US. However, the UK has not yet reached an agreement to lift tariffs imposed on its steel and aluminium exports during the Trump era. Last month, US Trade Representative Katherine Tai said the issue would be addressed \"when the time is right\". ",

The retailer said it had \"taken on board\" her comments about availability of cheaper food for households struggling to make ends meet. She had highlighted Asda in tweets critical about value ranges removed from shelves or going up in price. In response to Asda's move, Ms Monroe tweeted: \"Well, that went rather well.\" Asda currently stocks 150 Smart Price and Farm Stores products in 300 stores. All 200 products in these value ranges will now be available in all Asda stores by 1 March, said Meg Farren, Asda's chief customer officer. \"We want to help our customers' budgets stretch further and have taken on board the comments about the availability of our Smart Price range made by Jack Monroe. \"We are taking steps to put our full Smart Price and Farm Stores ranges in store and online to make these products as accessible as possible,\" Ms Farren said. Rising inflation and the cost of living crisis is hitting low-income households particularly hard. Ms Monroe, an activist and blogger on how to eat on a budget, says the cost of food staples such as cheap pasta and rice are going up in price faster than other products. She criticised Asda for discontinuing some budget products, such as a bag of rice sold online for 45p and replaced with rice costing a minimum of £1.20. Her Twitter thread details many other Asda products no longer available in her local store, where she is a regular shopper. In one tweet she said supermarket value products had to be \"universally available, or it's as good as useless\". The BBC is not responsible for the content of external sites.\nView original tweet on Twitter On Sunday, the chairman of Tesco, John Allan, told the BBC that the worst of food price inflation is to come, with prices likely to rise by 5% by April. But he said food costs make up a bigger proportion of spending for households on low-incomes, so it will hit the \"hardest up harder\". Ms Monroe has been critical of the way the official UK inflation rate - currently at a 30-year high of 5.4% - is calculated, saying it does not reflect the higher cost of food staples bought by poorer people. Earlier this month, the Office for National Statistics, which publishes the monthly inflation figure, said it would also publish a wider variety of \"cost of living metrics\" to better reflect the impact of price rises on households.

They have been attracted by the soaring sales of Peloton's exercise bikes and treadmills during the pandemic. Suitors have not been put off by the return to gyms post-lockdown, which has left the firm worth less than a fifth of its peak $50bn valuation. There have also been recent PR disasters when TV characters had heart attacks when using Peloton machines. Amazon declined to confirm or deny whether it was considering making an offer for the US exercise equipment maker. When the rumour was reported in the Wall Street Journal on Friday it sent shares in the firm surging more than 30% in after-hours trading. The Financial Times first reported Nike's decision to look at a deal. \"We don't comment on rumours and speculation,\" an Amazon spokesperson told the BBC, while Peloton and Nike did not immediately respond to requests for comment. Peloton takes another hit from TV heart attack\nPeloton pushes back at production pause report\nPeloton probed over the safety of its treadmills The once-stock market favourite has seen its shares slump in recent months, losing more than 80% of its value in the past year. When the Covid pandemic led to gyms closing in 2020, demand for Peloton's exercise equipment and remote workout classes jumped, sending its share price soaring. However, as lockdowns eased the appetite for its bikes and treadmills has dwindled. In August, the firm cut the price of its flagship bike by 20% to $1,495 (£1,105), as it revealed that its losses had widened and revenue growth had slowed. In the same month, the US Department of Justice and the Department of Homeland Security said they were investigating the company after a child was pulled under one of its treadmills and killed, while other customers had reported injuries. In November, Peloton warned investors that it expected revenue to slow in the year ahead. \"The primary drivers of our reduced forecast are a more pronounced tapering of demand related to the ongoing opening of the economy, and a richer than anticipated mix of sales to our original bike,\" it said in a recent letter to shareholders. Last month, investment firm Blackwells Capital called for Peloton's chief executive John Foley to be removed from his post and the business to be put up for sale. Peloton and its customer base are \"extremely attractive\" to companies like Nike, Apple, Disney and Sony, that are looking to boost their presence in the home, health and wellness and media spaces, Blackwells said in a letter to Peloton's board. Analysts at Wedbush Securities also expect other bidders to emerge. \"We would be shocked if Apple is not aggressively involved in this potential deal process,\" they said, also mentioning Disney as another possible suitor for the exercise business. \"We believe there will be a handful of technology and consumer brand stalwarts circling for a potential bid with activists also pushing a sale.\" Peloton made headlines recently after two television dramas, the Sex and the City revival And Just Like That and Billions, featured story lines in which characters suffered heart attacks while using its bikes. The company is due to publish its second quarter earnings on Tuesday. ",

            "content": "House price growth is set to slow \"considerably\" in the coming year, the Halifax has said, as households face a squeeze on their finances. The mortgage lender said house prices grew by 0.3% in January, the lowest monthly increase since June 2021. However, the rise meant the average price hit a record high of £276,759, and the Halifax said affordability remained at \"historically low levels\". Annual house price growth remained at 9.7% in January. The Halifax noted that house price rises continued to outstrip earnings growth. \"Despite record levels of first-time buyers stepping onto the ladder last year, younger generations still face significant barriers to home ownership as deposit requirements remain challenging,\" said Russell Galley, managing director at Halifax. \"This situation is expected to become more acute in the short-term as household budgets face even greater pressure from an increase in the cost of living, and rises in interest rates begin to feed through to mortgage rates. \"While the limited supply of new housing stock to the market will continue to provide some support to house prices, it remains likely that the rate of house price growth will slow considerably over the next year.\" How the interest rate rise might affect you\nUK house prices rose fastest for 17 years in 2021 Last week, the Nationwide's rival house price index reported that prices had risen at the fastest annual pace for a January in 17 years. But it too warned of affordability problems. \"A 10% deposit on a typical first-time buyer home is now equivalent to 56% of total gross annual earnings, a record high,\" said the building society's chief economist, Robert Gardner. Estate agents said they thought the market would remain resilient in 2022. \"Though price growth is slowing, these figures demonstrate the underlying strength of the market and how likely it is to withstand increasingly stretched affordability,\" said Jeremy Leaf, a north London estate agent and a former Royal institution of Chartered Surveyors (RICS) residential chairman. Nicky Stevenson, managing director at estate agent group Fine & Country, said the lack of properties coming up for sale would continue to underpin the market. \"The key driver of growth at present is the fact that the supply of housing stock remains so low, and without a strong injection of new listings, a correction in the market is unlikely to happen just by magic,\" she said. \"Signs that stock levels may improve in the coming months remain only tentative, and in the meantime the clamour for homes nationwide remains undiminished.\" ",

But some economists think the actual rate could be much higher. \"There are groups of academics who have come up with a technical measure of inflation. Their measurement was close to 60% [in December]. This creates a huge burden on society at large,\" said Durmus Yilmaz. He served as Turkish central bank governor between 2006 and 2011, and is now a member of the opposition party. Can tourists boost Turkey's economy?\nThe Turkish lira and inflation Just days before January's inflation data were released on Thursday, President Recep Tayyip Erdogan fired Sait Erdal Dincer, the head of Turkey's statistics agency. Local media reported the decision was fuelled by the president's dissatisfaction with a worsening economic situation, and a desire to seek re-election next year. In two weeks, Turkey's central bank will meet to discuss strategies for easing the pain on households. But policymakers are unlikely to pursue the usual method of cooling inflation with higher interest rates. That's because President Erdogan believes that higher rates cause inflation, a view that runs contrary to conventional economic theory. And in four of the past five months, he has directed the central bank to instead cut rates. Turkey cuts interest rates despite spiralling inflation This week the president said that for \"some time,\" people across the country will have to \"carry the burden\" of inflation. The high prices and depreciating currency have put a tight squeeze on household budgets. The price of red meat, for example, has soared so much, many families say they can no longer afford it. Those who can do so buy it less frequently or in smaller amounts. In December, the lira's plunge forced grocery stores to re-price goods on the shelf almost every day. And one woman, Montoya, who goes to university in Istanbul, said she decided to rent her extra bedroom to tourists to be able to make rent payments each month. \"I'm really worried about it, because I'm really scared when someone comes to me, and I don't know him or her. \"It's staying at home with someone I don't know. \"It's really scary, actually, but I can't do anything else. Yesterday I went to the market and one bag is 300 lira. One month ago it was 150,\" she said. The economic situation is growing more severe for those inside the country. But a favourable exchange rate has made Turkey a more attractive holiday destination for people in other parts of the world. Before the coronavirus pandemic, in 2019 tourism brought $34bn (£25bn) into Turkey. And though lockdowns and travel restrictions pummelled the sector in 2020, it bounced back in 2021. Arrivals jumped 85.5%, though revenue was still a third lower than it was pre-pandemic. Sebnem Altin leads group tours across the country for the Grand Circle Travel company. She said there are bookings, but she believes the recovery is still fragile. \"This past season, people could just cancel their tours at the last minute and agencies are quite flexible with it, which is something new. \"For that reason, even though we have bookings and everything looks really beautifully rosy for the year coming up, we can never be sure that these bookings will be realised. \"So I always have concerns and I'm not confident, I have to say,\" she said. Tourism makes up about 13% of Turkey's overall economy. The country was the sixth-most popular tourist destination in 2019, according to the World Trade Organisation. And, even then, it said the favourable exchange rate was a key factor in attracting tourists. If the industry continues to recover as travel restrictions continue to ease this year, it could provide wider economic benefits for Turkey, according to Roger Kelly, a lead regional economist at the European Bank for Reconstruction and Development. He said one of the underlying structural problems for the economy is the nation's current account deficit, which means the value of goods and services Turkey imports is more than exports. More tourism revenue would help reduce that deficit, he said. \"Clearly, if you've got good tourism revenues coming in, this helps reduce the current account deficit, which makes financing it straightforward, which helps support the lira. \"It means your inflation problem is reduced, because a weaker lira helps to feed inflation. \"So, from that perspective, if you have a reasonably strong tourism season, this helps to support the lira and helps bring down inflation,\" Mr Kelly said.

            "content": "Unions have reacted with fury after the Bank of England boss urged workers not to ask for big pay rises, to help stop prices rising out of control. Andrew Bailey told the BBC wage rises needed to be moderate with firms showing \"restraint\" in pay talks. When asked whether the Bank was asking workers not to demand big pay rises, Mr Bailey, said: \"Broadly, yes.\" Downing Street and the Treasury distanced themselves from Mr Bailey's comments. The GMB union branded the comments a \"sick joke\", while the TUC said calls for pay restraint were \"ill-founded\". \"Telling the hard-working people who carried this country through the pandemic they don't deserve a pay rise is outrageous. It's a sick joke,\" said Gary Smith, GMB's general secretary. TUC head of economics Kate Bell said increasing pay at a slower rate would \"make the squeeze on family budgets even tighter\". \"Energy prices are pushing up inflation - not wage demands. Britain needs a pay rise - not another decade of lost pay and living standards,\" she added. And Unite lead Sharon Graham said workers did not need \"lectures\" from Mr Bailey \"on exercising pay restraint\". \"Let's be clear, pay restraint is nothing more than a call for a national pay cut.\" Sunak defends response as energy bills soar by £693\nMost homes to get energy bill discount of £350\nDon't ask for a big pay rise, warns Bank boss When asked about Mr Bailey's comments, the prime minister's official spokesman said: \"Well, it's not something the prime minister is calling for. We obviously want a high growth economy and we want people's wages to increase.\" Chancellor Rishi Sunak said on Thursday that it was not his job to set private sector wages, and that the right way to achieve higher wages was through greater productivity. Inflation, the rate at which prices are rising, is on course to rise above 7% this year and average close to 6% in 2022. This means prices are expected to climb faster than pay, putting the biggest squeeze on household finances in decades, with workers set to experience the biggest hit to their take-home income since 1990. Workers are currently getting pay rises of just below 5% on average. Mr Bailey was paid £575,538 including pension, in the year from 1 March 2020, more than 18 times higher the median annual pay of £31,285 for full-time employees. He said that while it would be \"painful\" for workers to accept that prices would rise faster than their wages, he added that some \"moderation of wage rises\" was needed to prevent the rise in the cost of living becoming entrenched. \"I'm not saying don't give yourself a pay rise. This is about the size of it [any rise]... we do need to see restraint,\" he added. The Treasury supported Mr Bailey, with chief secretary Simon Clarke saying it was \"important that pay restraint is observed\". The boss of British Gas owner Centrica, Chris O'Shea, told the BBC he could see both sides. \"If this is a temporary spike in inflation and wages rise to meet that temporary spike, then the people paying those wages have to pass on that cost and that's where you get into the wage price inflation spiral. \"But if you are trying to figure out how to pay for your groceries at Aldi, then its not enough to sit and say well I'm not going to do this... you are worried about paying your bills, you're worried about feeding your family, you're worried about heating your home. \" Meanwhile, the High Pay Centre think tank said Mr Bailey's comments \"while not ill intentioned\" were \"frankly absurd\" and \"insulting\". It said the cost of living hike followed more than a decade of wages stagnating, during which the top executives were paid 86 times more than the average worker. \"It's time that those with the broadest shoulders genuinely start to take on more of the burden of the economic challenges we face,\" it said. Certain industries and professions are seeing bigger pay increases due to labour shortages. For example, lorry drivers, who are in high demand, have received wage hikes of up to 20%.

In total, his drivers received a £7,000 rise, taking average salaries to £39,000 a year and pushing up what his business spends on wages to between 30% to 40% of its total costs. Mr Dziewirz said \"big blue chip companies\" were paying \"extremely big amounts\", especially in the run-up to Christmas, with some offering as much as £44 an hour. He said his firm's wage rises had been covered by increasing its prices, but added \"ultimately it [the cost] comes back to the end consumer\". Mr Bailey said the rise in living costs would not ease until next year, with the UK facing a \"difficult period\" ahead. \"We're going to start coming out of it in 2023, and two years from now, we expect inflation back to a more stable position,\" he added. The Bank increased interest rates from 0.25% to 0.5% on Thursday, the same day millions of households were informed they will have to pay an extra £693 a year on energy bills from April. Rising gas and electricity costs are the main factors pushing up prices across the economy. The rise in energy bills has led the government to announce measures to cut energy costs for many households by £350 through a combination of rebates and council tax cuts to ease the impact. However, Mike Brewer, chief economist at the Resolution Foundation, said by not targeting \"families most in need of support, and by trying to minimise the cost of support to the public purse\", households would still face significant bill rises and higher bills \"for many years to come\". Chancellor Rishi Sunak said on Thursday that it was \"not sustainable to keep holding the price of energy artificially low\". \"For me to stand here and pretend we don't have to adjust to paying higher prices would be wrong and dishonest,\" he said.

            "content": "The US saw strong hiring last month, despite disruption caused by the Omicron variant of coronavirus. Employers added 467,000 jobs, the Labor Department said. That was far better than analysts had predicted. The jobless rate inched up from 3.9% in December to 4%, but that was due to more people looking for work. Analysts said the robust job creation was likely to add to the pressure on the US central bank to raise interest rates next month. The monthly survey also revised up its estimates for hiring in December, providing more support for those who say the economy will remain strong even as officials withdraw stimulus policies put in place at the start of the pandemic in 2020. \"This is a big positive surprise,\" said Brian Coulton, chief economist at Fitch Ratings. \"It confirms that each successive wave of the virus is having a smaller and smaller impact on activity and labour demand.\" Federal Reserve chair Jerome Powell has said the bank is eyeing a rate increase next month - which would be the first rise since 2018. The move is intended to help curb price increases, by cooling demand with higher borrowing costs. US economy grows at fastest pace in decades\nUS central bank says rate rise 'appropriate' soon\nUS prices rise at fastest rate in nearly 40 years The central bank is under pressure to rein in inflation, which is rising at its fastest pace in nearly 40 years. In the UK, the Bank of England has already raised interest rates twice in the past three months. President Joe Biden, whose approval ratings have sagged amid widespread concerns about inflation, acknowledged the cost-of-living pressures in remarks celebrating the jobs figures. He said his administration was working to address the issues, including by encouraging investment in areas that have been hit by shortages, such as microchips. He also pushed Congress to move forward with his administration's currently stalled spending proposals, which he said would provide relief through programmes like subsidised childcare for families. \"We're still going to work on gas prices, we're still going to work on food prices,\" he said. \"In the meantime, there's a lot we can do to give these families a little extra breathing room.\" US businesses have reported widespread pressures due to increased materials costs and higher wages- inflation economists say have been fuelled in part by the wave of government stimulus that followed the pandemic. The latest jobs report showed the average hourly wage has increased by 5.7% over the last 12 months - a stark acceleration from the meagre gains seen in recent years. However, the jump does not keep pace with the fast pace of price increases hitting the economy. Still, there are signs the pay gains are helping to lure people back into the workforce. The share of people working or looking for work last month exceeded 62% for the first time since the pandemic hit. Women's participation has picked up especially in recent months, as schools and nurseries reopen. Restaurants and bars helped to drive the hiring in the US in January. Retailers, warehouse and transportation businesses also added workers. However, the report showed Omicron still took a toll. About six million people said they did not work or saw their hours cut due to the pandemic - almost double the prior month. ",

            "content": "Facebook's owner Meta Platforms saw its stock market value slump by more than $230bn (£169bn) on Thursday, in a record daily loss for a US firm. Its shares fell 26.4% after quarterly figures disappointed investors. Meta also said that Facebook's daily active users (DAUs) had dropped for the first time in its 18-year history. The company's share price slide saw chief executive Mark Zuckerberg's net worth fall by $31bn, according to the Bloomberg Billionaires Index. The drop in Mr Zuckerberg's personal fortune was equivalent to the annual gross domestic product of Estonia. Even after that drop, Mr Zuckerberg has an estimated net worth of almost $90bn, which means he is still one of the richest people in the world. That came after Meta revealed that Facebook's DAUs fell to 1.929bn in the three months to the end of December, compared to 1.930bn in the previous quarter. It was the first time ever that this measure of activity on the world's biggest social network had gone into reverse. Meta's stock market slump came on the eve of the 18th anniversary of the founding of Facebook. Facebook sees daily users fall for first time ever\nFacebook-funded cryptocurrency Diem winds down Meta also warned of slowing revenue growth in the face of competition from rival platforms including TikTok and YouTube, while advertisers were also cutting spending. Mr Zuckerberg said the firm's sales growth had been hurt as audiences, especially younger users, had left for rivals. The firm forecast revenues of between $27bn and $29bn for the first quarter of this year, which was lower than analysts had expected. Although the company has been making investments in video services to compete with TikTok, owned by Chinese technology giant ByteDance, it makes less money from those offerings than its traditional Facebook and Instagram feeds. It's clear that Meta is facing a whirlwind of different problems. Last year Apple brought in its App Tracking Transparency policy. It lets people choose whether or not they want to be tracked around the internet by companies, like Meta, who can then sell that information to advertisers. That is a major problem for Facebook, because finding information out about you and selling it to advertisers is exactly how it makes money. Its quarterly results showed advertising income falling, partly for this reason. Meta's rivals, like TikTok, are also attracting younger audiences. And user growth has stagnated around the world. There are bigger longer term issues too. Meta makes money from advertising. Yet the company's name has been changed to mark a concept - the Metaverse - a thing that doesn't exist yet and won't do for years. Mark Zuckerberg is committed to spending tens of billions of dollars on the project, even though evidence that people actually want to live their lives in virtual reality is scant. It all means many investors are unfriending. Meta, which owns the world's second largest digital advertising platform after Google, also said it had been hit by privacy changes on Apple's operating system. The changes, which make it harder for brands to target and measure their advertising on Facebook and Instagram, could have an impact \"in the order of $10bn\" for this year, the firm said. \"Clearly Meta got more impacted compared to its rivals as other social media like Snap posted healthy results,\" said Sachin Mittal, head of telecom and internet sector research at DBS Bank. \"While there has been a broad negative impact on the whole tech sector, we reckon players with lower reliance on targeted ads or better algorithms to cope with Apple's changes would still do well.\" Meta's share price slump also dragged on other social media platforms, including Twitter, Snap and Pinterest during Thursday's regular trading session. However, Snap's shares jumped by almost 60% in after-hours trade as it reported its first ever quarterly profit. ",

            "content": "The community-focused Nextdoor social network has grown substantially during the pandemic, but has had to make changes, says chief executive Sarah Friar, in an exclusive interview with the BBC. Nextdoor, unlike the bigger social networks, is designed to offer a hyper-local experience, creating social newsfeeds about your neighbourhood, with posts by verified people who live near you. The California-based company has now more than 66 million users, the majority of them in the United States. Users of the platform find things like lengthy debates about new bike lanes, photo montages of mysterious strangers loitering outside houses, and heartfelt pleas for lost pets in their feeds. But there are also sometimes heartwarming acts of kindness, when the community rallies round to help those in need. Nextdoor says the app is used by one in five households in the UK, where it launched in 2016. You must provide extra proof of your identity like a billing address to sign up. Its daily active usage was doubling on a weekly basis as the pandemic took hold in early 2020, according to Ms Friar. Her team could see engagement levels spike in Italy, then across Europe, to the UK and Australia, as Covid-19 swept the world. \"It has the awesome outcome that you feel you are there for your customers, but we also had to make sure the back-end technology was really going to scale,\" she says. After worries about the technology being up to the task were addressed, it was user experience that became the priority. During the pandemic, many people have used it to share information about things like vaccine centres and walking groups for the lonely, or to issue pleas for food packages to be delivered to loved ones. The platform made several changes in light of the pandemic, explains Ms Friar. It created \"help maps\" to allow volunteers to identify themselves, ready to offer their services to those who needed them, for things like food deliveries to people who are isolating. It also allowed businesses to post directly into people's newsfeeds. This represented a significant change for Nextdoor, because in its early years all commerce was banned on the platform. Many at the company saw commercial activity as \"inauthentic\", \"antithetical to a kinder world\" and running contrary to the company's original community-building goals, says Ms Friar. \"[But] Very quickly we saw local businesses starting to flounder [in lockdown] and we wanted to help them.\" The other big issue across all social networks is, of course, disinformation around Covid-19. \"A lot of people were accidentally spreading misinformation,\" says Ms Friar. \"They hear something from a neighbour, they put it on the platform, suddenly it gets this viral effect.\" In response the company introduced a \"Covid misinformation reminder\", a pop-up box triggered when users are set to post keywords, like \"vaccine\". This prompts people to source information they are posting, with links to trusted resources like the NHS or government portals. It only pops up on the first occasion a user prepares to post using this language. This was an adaptation of the company's kindness reminders, which have appeared since 2019, when someone starts to compose a post using inflammatory words. Last year the platform added a similar function triggered by any racist language, in the wake of the Black Lives Matter protests. Racism and racial profiling has been a big issue for Nextdoor, especially in the United States. It uses community volunteers to help with moderation, keeping users within the guidelines - they have the power to vote content off the platform. However, Nextdoor experienced problems in 2020 when moderators deleted content associated with the Black Lives Matter movement, for being part of national rather than local conversations - Ms Friar had to step in to make clear such conversations were indeed allowed within the guidelines. Nextdoor was founded in 2010 by a group of friends, many of whom had originally worked at Shopping.com. The initial prototype of the network was set up to serve a small community in Menlo Park in Silicon Valley, California, but the successful model quickly spread around the States. The company, which still makes a loss, floated on the US stock market last year and was valued at $4.3bn (£3.1bn). Ms Friar joined Nextdoor as chief executive in 2018 after working at Salesforce and Square. She is still something of a rarity as a female tech chief executive in Silicon Valley. That's one reason she founded another enterprise, Ladies Who Launch. Its purpose is to help female entrepreneurs network and access business education resources. The idea for this came from a \"lightbulb moment\", she says. \"Women and minorities find it really hard to find their tribes. White men don't have the same experience, because you walk into a business meeting and largely everyone looks like you. \"You're kind of getting peer-mentored all the time and you don't even think of it, it's just your life. \"But when women walk into a room there can be no-one who looks like them - or people of colour - so [when] bringing together women, we realised that there is huge power in peer mentorship.\" ",

            "content": "The UK needs to create a new motoring tax to plug the revenue gap as drivers switch to electric cars, MPs have said. The government should tax motorists based on miles travelled as the use of petrol and diesel vehicles decreases, the Transport Select Committee said. If no action is taken this year, the UK faces a £35bn \"black hole\" in its finances, they said. The Treasury said tax revenues would keep pace with changes prompted by electric vehicle take-up. Sales of new petrol and diesel cars and vans will be banned in the UK from 2030 and sales of electric cars are already soaring. Taken together, vehicle excise duty - better known as \"car tax\" - and fuel duty that motorists pay at the pump, raise around £35bn a year, but neither tax is levied on pure electric vehicles. The committee warned there is likely to be no revenue from existing tax sources by 2040. The MPs said charging people based on how much they drive, using technology to track cars' movements, should be considered. Such a scheme could factor in the type of vehicle and congestion, and support vulnerable groups such as those with mobility issues, and people in remote areas, the committee said. Motorists should pay \"the same or less\" than they do currently, the MPs said. Road pricing is not a new idea. But it has previously proved an unpopular one in the UK. Motoring groups believe many drivers do now support the principle of paying more tax the more you drive. But public opinion is not the only factor - there are many outstanding questions. If road pricing did come in, what exact technology would be used, who would provide it, and what reassurances could be offered over privacy, given the amount of data captured? How could it work alongside the local schemes already in place, such as city congestion charges? And when would be the right time? Too early and it might put people off buying electric cars. Too late and cheaper driving could lead to more congestion, and electric car drivers who've grown used to not being taxed may not react positively to the belated introduction of a charge. Huw Merriman, the chair of the Transport Committee, said that unless the government acts now the \"loss of two major sources of motor taxation will leave a £35bn black hole\" in government finances. \"That's 4% of the entire tax-take, \" he said. \"Only £7bn of this goes back to the roads. Schools and hospitals could be [hit] if motorists don't continue to pay.\" He said using road pricing technology could help ease congestion. \"By using price as a lever, we can offer better prices at less congested times and have technology compare these directly to public transport alternatives,\" he said, adding: \"Net-zero emissions should not mean zero tax revenue.\" The committee called for the Treasury and the Department for Transport to set up an arms length body to look at future motoring taxation. A Treasury spokesperson said: \"The government has committed to ensuring that motoring tax revenues keep pace with the changes brought about by the switch to electric vehicles, whilst keeping the transition affordable for consumers. \"We will respond to the committee's recommendations in full in due course.\" Electric car sales soar, but chip shortage hits market\nCar production falls to lowest level for 65 years Figures from the Society of Motor Manufacturers and Traders show battery electric vehicles accounted for more than one in ten new cars registered in the UK last year. RAC Foundation director Steve Gooding said the \"silver lining of zero-carbon motoring comes wrapped in a cloud of trouble for the chancellor as his fuel duty income dries up\". \"Forget 2050, our analysis shows that fuel duty revenue from cars alone could be down by £5bn a year as soon as 2028 because of accelerating sales of battery-powered cars,\" he said. \"Drivers choosing to go electric deserve to know what is coming next - particularly if the promise of cheap per-mile running costs is set to be undermined by a future tax change. He added that the Treasury needed to act promptly or risk \"a furious backlash from drivers who made the choice to go electric expecting to save money\". Silviya Barrett, head of policy at the Campaign for Better Transport, said: \"Road pricing, based on distance travelled and how polluting a vehicle is, can be a fairer system for everyone. \"It can reduce congestion, air pollution and carbon emissions and encourage a shift to greener modes where possible.\" ",

            "content": "Multiple oil transport and storage companies across Europe are dealing with cyber-attacks. IT systems have been disrupted at Oiltanking in Germany, SEA-Invest in Belgium and Evos in the Netherlands. In total dozens of terminals with oil storage and transport around the world have been affected, with firms reporting that the attacks occurred over the weekend. But experts caution against assuming this is a co-ordinated attack. The BBC understands that all three companies' IT systems went down or were severely disrupted. Belgian prosecutors say they are investigating the cyber-attack that's affected SEA-Invest terminals including the company's largest in Antwerp, called SEA-Tank. A spokeswoman for the company said they were hit on Sunday with every port they run in Europe and Africa affected. The company is working to get a back-up IT system online but says that most liquid transportation is operational. The spokeswoman said SEA-Invest is aware of the cyber-attacks against other companies but investigations have not determined if there is a link. A spokesperson for Evos in the Netherlands told the BBC that IT services at terminals in Terneuzen, Ghent and Malta have \"caused some delays in execution\". On Monday Oiltanking Deutschland GmbH & Co. KG, which stores and transports oil, vehicle fuels and other petroleum products, said it had been hacked. The company was forced to operate at a \"limited capacity\" and was investigating the incident, it said. Some reports suggest the attack on Oiltanking is ransomware, where hackers scramble data and make computer systems inoperable until they get paid a ransom. In May last year a ransomware attack on US oil supplier Colonial Pipeline saw supplies tighten across the US and multiple states declaring an emergency. An employee of a major barging company in the Netherlands told the BBC that port supply chains were disrupted. The worker said they first noticed problems on Tuesday when oil deliveries started slowing down. He said \"things are moving but much slower than normal\". Should paying hacker ransoms be banned?\nThe ransomware surge ruining lives\nUS recovers most of Colonial Pipeline ransom The disruption comes as tensions remain high between Ukraine and Russia and as concern over rising energy prices grows. But cyber-security experts caution against jumping to the conclusion that the multiple incidents are the result of a co-ordinated effort to disrupt the European energy sector. \"Some types of malware scoop up emails and contact lists and use them to automatically spam malicious attachments or links, so companies with shared connections can sometimes be hit in quick succession,\" said Brett Callow, Threat Analyst at cyber-security company Emsisoft. \"This is why you sometimes see sector-based or geographic-based clusters of incidents.\" Another possible explanation could be that all the companies use the same software for operations that may have been compromised by hackers.

            "content": "Millions of households will typically pay an extra £693 a year on their energy bills from April, but chancellor Rishi Sunak said his support plan would take the \"sting\" out of the rise. The sharp rise in energy bills will put a further squeeze on people already facing higher prices and rising taxes. The chancellor said help of £350 per household would \"ease\" people's anxiety over the increase. But the scheme was criticised for not being targeted on those most in need. Despite costing the government £9bn this year the average earner was still likely to be £400 worse off than last year, Paul Johnson, director of the influential Institute for Fiscal Studies said, due to a combination of tax rises and inflation. More than half of the support package was \"effectively a loan\", Mr Johnson added. Wholesale gas prices have been rising sharply over the last few months, which meant the regulator Ofgem was obliged to announce a rise in the cap that limits what companies can charge consumers in England, Scotland and Wales. The higher cap means a typical household will pay £1,971 a year from April, 54% more than they pay now, with a further rise expected in October. The £693 a year rise will affect 22 million households, with 4.5 million customers on prepayment meters facing an even bigger increase of £708 a year. Mr Sunak said the majority of families would receive a total of £350 to help them adjust to higher prices. However, only £150 will arrive by the time energy bills rise in April. \"I really believe that what we're doing, £350, it's a significant amount of money that will make a big difference to the vast majority of households, and I think people, I hope actually, will be reassured by us stepping in,\" the chancellor said. The council tax rebate applies to homes in bands A to D, covering about 80% of households, which Mr Johnson said meant it was only \"very loosely\" targeted at lower-income households. The other £200 will be taken off energy bills from October, but households will pay that back in instalments from 2023. Millions to get energy bill rebates of up to £350\n‘How can we afford anything with bills this high?’ Higher energy bills are set to play a key role in what the Resolution Foundation think tank has described as a \"cost of living catastrophe\" facing people across the UK this year. Although wages are rising, they are not growing fast enough to make up for prices that are rising at their fastest pace for 30 years. Tax changes in April, including a higher rate of National Insurance, will slim pay packets further. Post-tax incomes are now forecast to fall 2% this year, after taking into account the rising cost of living. This represents the biggest fall in take-home pay since records began in 1990. On Thursday the Bank of England increased interest rates from 0.25% to 0.5% to try to dampen the pace of price rises over the longer term but the Bank said inflation could still reach 7.25% in April. Many people say they are already having to adapt to cope with higher prices, including 24-year-old Michael Ball, from Kirkcaldy, He pays for his electricity via a pre-payment meter in the flat where he lives, but he goes back to his parents' house to wash his clothes to save money. \"I do worry about money a lot. It's a big burden and this news is something that makes me feel anxious,\" he said. He said he might have to move back in with his parents if his energy bills continued to rise. \"If I lose my independence, my own space, I worry about how it might affect my finances and mental health.\" Tell us how you have been affected by the issues raised in this story.

Labour's shadow chancellor Rachel Reeves criticised Mr Sunak for not scrapping VAT on energy bills. She said that despite the chancellor's pledges the \"uncomfortable truth\" was that families in Britain would still be paying hundreds of pounds more for energy after April. She described the plan as a \"buy now pay later scheme that loads up costs for tomorrow\". The cap, which is announced every six months, sets the prices that suppliers can charge for each unit of energy as well as the standing charge. This is then translated into the expected annual bill for a household that uses the typical amount of gas and electricity. That does not mean there is a limit to how much people can pay. The more gas and electricity that is used, the higher the bill. What's the energy price cap and why is it going up? Anyone who is on a standard variable tariff, whose fixed deal has come to an end (or is about to), and those moved because their old supplier went bust will be affected by the new higher cap. Analysts suggest the next change in the cap, scheduled for October, could add hundreds of pounds more on to a typical bill this coming winter. There is a separate cap for 4.5 million people on prepayment meters, for whom there will be a rise from £1,309 a year to £2,017 in April for a typical household bill. Energy firms are struggling under the weight of surging wholesale gas prices. The new cap will allow them to pass some of that cost onto customers. Ofgem's announcement was brought forward as part of a coordinated approach of announcements about the cost of living.

            "content": "Oil and gas giant BP has been confirmed as the commercial partner for Aberdeen's hydrogen ambitions. It has already been projected that hundreds of jobs could be created within 10 years if the city becomes a leading hydrogen hub. Aberdeen City Council's city growth and resources committee has now approved the partnership with BP. The Granite City already has a fleet of double-decker buses which are powered by hydrogen. BP remains a major player in the fossil fuel industry, and has often faced criticism from environmentalists but the firm insists it is also investing in renewables. In October, Greenpeace lost its case against the UK government over a North Sea oil field permit for the company. Permission to drill the Vorlich site off Aberdeen was given to BP in 2018. The plan is for the Aberdeen Hydrogen Hub to have a solar power facility connected to a green hydrogen production and refuelling facility. Green hydrogen refers to when the gas is produced renewable energy as opposed to methods that release greenhouse emissions. Aberdeen hydrogen hub 'could create 700 jobs'\nElementary energy: The case for hydrogen\nAberdeen zone funds to help green energy transition Council leader Jenny Laing said: \"This is a huge announcement for Aberdeen as it supports the delivery of our Net Zero Vision and paves the way for the city to be a world leader in the production of hydrogen-based green fuel and energy. \"Aberdeen has a worldwide reputation as a pioneering hydrogen city and by working in partnership with BP, we intend to put Aberdeen at the forefront of the green economic recovery.\" Louise Kingham, BP's UK head of country and senior vice president for Europe, said the company was committed to providing \"integrated energy solutions\" such as the hydrogen hub. \"We look forward to working with the local authority to deliver this exciting project, drawing on the skills and expertise of our people and their vast experience delivering complex energy projects\", she said. Hydrogen's most likely uses, at least initially, are in heavy industry, and in heavy transport including trucks, buses and rail. It could also be used in home heating, if the technology can allow for a transition from natural gas. ",

            "content": "Millions of households will receive energy bill discounts totalling £350 to ease the impact of soaring energy bills, the chancellor has said. Rishi Sunak announced a repayable £200 discount on bills for homes in England, Wales and Scotland from October. There will also be a further £150 council tax rebate for most households in England, with additional cash for the devolved nations. Labour criticised the plan, calling it a \"buy now, pay later scheme\". The government's support package comes ahead of a 54% rise in annual energy bills from April, with people set to pay an extra £693 a year on average. Mr Sunak has admitted \"even those on middle incomes will feel the pinch\". The council tax rebate will apply from April to homes in council tax bands A to D, benefiting about 80% of households. It will be made directly by local authorities and will not need to be repaid. Energy bills to rise by 54% a year for millions\nWhat's the energy price cap and why is it going up? The rebate on energy bills will provide around 28 million households with an upfront discount on their bills worth £200 and suppliers will apply the discount to domestic electricity customers from October, with the government meeting the costs. However, unlike the council tax rebate, this discount will be automatically recovered from people's bills in equal £40 instalments over a five year period from 2023, when it is hoped global wholesale gas prices will have come down. The Institute of Fiscal Studies (IFS) said the package would not stop average incomes and living standards from falling over the coming year, but added that lowest paid workers would benefit from National Living Wage and Universal Credit increases. Energy bills have soared in the last six months due to a record increase in global gas prices. It has led to many smaller energy firms going bust due to suppliers being unable to deliver price promises to customers. Mr Sunak told the BBC the support would help the majority of families to \"adjust\" to higher prices. He said \"four out of five English households\" would get the council tax discount of £150 pounds in April. \"I think this is a price shock, which is significant enough that even those on middle incomes will feel the pinch of this,\" he said. \"I know people are worried about the cost of living and in particular rising energy prices.\" Mr Sunak said it would be \"wrong and dishonest\" for him to pretend that \"we don't have to adjust our higher energy prices\". But he said the government could \"take the sting\" out of higher bills by spreading the cost to consumers over many years. The chancellor announced a £150m \"discretionary fund\" to local authorities to provide support to those who happen to live in higher-banded properties, including those who don't pay council tax. Mr Sunak said the government will also go ahead with an existing plan to expand the eligibility of the Warm Homes Discount so that three million people could benefit from the scheme, compared to one million people currently. Devolved governments in Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland are expected to receive around £565m of funding as a result of the council tax and energy rebate in England. Meanwhile, Northern Ireland will be given £150m to provide comparable support through the Barnett formula next year. Labour criticised the government's plans, with shadow chancellor Rachel Reeves calling it a \"buy now, pay later scheme that loads up costs for tomorrow\". Instead, her party called on the government to scrap the 5% VAT rate on domestic energy bills for 12 months from April. Labour also wants an extra £3.5bn spent on the Warm Home Discount, increasing it from £140 to £400 per year, and trebling the number of households eligible to 9.3 million, around a third of the UK total. The party says it would pay for its plans through a year-long 10 percentage point increase to the corporation tax paid by North Sea oil producers on their profits. The Liberal Democrats have also backed a windfall tax on energy firms to pay more generous support for poorer households. But Mr Sunak rejected the idea of a windfall tax, arguing it would deter investment in the energy sector. He also rejected a VAT cut, insisting it would \"disproportionately benefit wealthier households\". Helen Miller, deputy director at the IFS, said the £200 bill rebate provided short-term relief for households, but was \"only delaying the pain\", due to customers needing to start paying the rebate back next year. The IFS also said a higher fraction of households in northern regions would benefit from the council tax cut than in London and the south. Tom Wernham, research economist at the IFS, said with council tax bands based on property valuations in 1991, \"there will be more beneficiaries in northern regions, and they will on average have higher incomes\". He added more than 10% of the lowest income households would not be entitled to automatic support through this scheme, and would have to rely on discretionary help instead. ",

Amanda, from Preston, said after bills, she had about £10 each month.

A rise in the energy price cap means about 18 million UK households will pay an extra £693 a year from April.

Amanda, who is unemployed and receives about £500 in benefits every month, told BBC North West Tonight it was \"really upsetting\". \"I look at people who are doing well with good jobs and I think 'I want to live like that',\" she said. \"I have to bring my duvets downstairs with hot water bottles for us both.\" She said dealing with the situation was \"a big struggle\" and leaves her under \"so much stress and pressure\". \"Sometimes I have to miss one bill and pay it a week or two after,\" she said. \"That is how I survive.\" Hussain Master, who lives a few miles away and works full-time, said after bills, he and his family were left with about £60 each month.

            "content": "Millions of people facing a spike in energy costs will find out shortly how much more they will have to pay. The energy regulator's new price cap - the maximum amount suppliers can charge customers for each unit of energy - is likely to add hundreds of pounds onto the annual bill for 22 million homes. Ofgem's new cap for England, Wales and Scotland will take effect in April. Ministers are reported to have plans to provide loans for energy firms to help them cut money from customers' bills. Details of the new cap are due to be announced at 11:00 GMT. A typical household will face an annual increase of more than £600 on their energy bill, with a further increase of as much as £400 to come in the winter after the next cap is set in six months' time, analysts at Cornwall Insight have said. The cost of living in general is forecast to rise further this year, and the Bank of England will also announce on Thursday whether it will increase interest rates to combat rising prices. There are also planned tax rises in April, with Prime Minister Boris Johnson under intense pressure to scrap an increase in National Insurance. But he, and Chancellor Rishi Sunak, said at the weekend the tax rise would go ahead. Among those braced for the squeeze on their finances is 24-year-old Michael Ball, from Kirkcaldy. His biggest worry is that a significant rise in energy prices could mean he would no longer be able to afford the rent on his one-bedroom flat, and would have to move back in with his parents. \"Anything over a 30% rise in April would make me leave this flat. I'm already spending more than my rent on energy,\" he said. He said he was \"very anxious\" about the rise, and expected it to be a \"big challenge\". The cap, which is announced every six months, sets the prices that suppliers can charge for each unit of energy as well as the standing charge. This is then translated into the expected annual bill for a household that uses the typical amount of gas and electricity. At present, that is £1,277, but analysts are predicting a 50% rise from April. That does not mean there is a limit to how much people can pay. The more gas and electricity that is used, the higher the bill. What's the energy price cap and why is it going up? Anyone who is on a standard variable tariff, whose fixed deal has come to an end (or is about to), and those moved because their old supplier went bust will be affected by the new higher cap. There is a separate cap for 4.5 million people on prepayment meters. It means a household using a typical amount of gas and electricity pays £1,309 a year. Energy firms are struggling under the weight of surging wholesale gas prices. The new cap will allow them to pass some of that cost onto customers. Joe Malinowski, founder of energy price comparison website The Energy Shop, said: \"The energy price cap has already bankrupted over half of all energy suppliers in the market. Now it is set to bankrupt the consumer. \"Come 1 April, energy households up and down the country are set to get battered by colossal increases in energy bills. For many, if not most, it will be simply unaffordable.\" However, ministers are expected to announce a package of measures to reduce the immediate impact on households. The plans are expected to include the Treasury's \"rebate and clawback\" scheme, which would involve providing around £5-6bn in loans to energy firms to enable them to lower bills from April - possibly by about £200. But it has raised concerns among providers because the money would still have to be paid back eventually by billpayers. As oil giant Shell announced a huge increase in profits, Labour has called for a windfall tax to pay to keep consumer bills down. Shell's earnings reached $19.2bn (£14.2bn) in 2021, about four times the level recorded a year earlier. \"With oil and gas profits booming in recent months because of the spike in energy prices, it is clearer than ever that the North Sea oil and gas producers who have made a fortune recently should be asked to contribute,\" said Labour's shadow climate change secretary Ed Miliband. \"Our plan, part paid for with a one-off windfall tax on North Sea oil and gas profits, would save most households £200 off their bills, with targeted support of up to £400 on top of that to the squeezed middle, pensioners and the lowest earners. Nigel Pocklington, chief executive of renewable energy supplier Good Energy, said there was \"a lot unexplained\" about the government's proposal, but added a £200 rebate would \"help\" households. He told the BBC's Today programme: \"It looks to be quite a complex and perhaps a slightly rushed proposal in that there's all sorts of open questions around what happens if a customer leaves you and you have borrowed money to smooth their bill? \"What happens if a customer is already on a low tariff? Do we cut that even lower?\" Meanwhile, the managing director of supermarket chain Iceland, Richard Walker, said he was concerned that \"bricks and mortar\" retailers and businesses were \"going to bear the brunt\" of rising energy prices. \"I think it's safe to say 2022 is probably set to be the hardest year ever for many UK families,\" he added. \"We are talking about energy prices and costs directly affecting consumers but that is also going to have a huge knock on effect for businesses too.

            "header": "Price inflation: The heat is on",
            "content": "Price inflation is already evident, from margarine to mince to used cars and petrol.\nBut it is rare to foresee how much higher it is going to get, as the cap is raised on household energy costs. A sharp rise in price inflation has rarely, if ever, been so well-signalled. On 1 April, the price cap on household fuel goes up - a lot. Today, we find out precisely how much. A few days after that increase, employers and employees see a significant hike in National Insurance contributions, and council tax bills will surely rise - meaning less disposable income. Price inflation has already been getting well out of its 2% target zone, most recently at 5.4% for year-on-year increases across a big basket of goods and services. Millions braced for huge rise in energy prices\nWhat's the energy price cap and why is it going up?\nFour things that are going up in price and why It is food and petrol where people have already noticed prices going up fastest, along with a 31% increase over the past year in the price of used car. Petrol is up from £1.14 per litre at the end of 2020 and is now heading towards £1.50 on the back of crude oil prices around $90 per barrel. That food increase is not for everything. Bread prices are stable, and flour is down on last year. Bananas are slightly cheaper, and avocados were 8% lower in December. But for many of the staples, prices are sharply up: pork sausages by 9% according to the 2021 figures from the Office for National Statistics: mince by 5%, roasting beef by 29%, margarine by 31%, milk by 7%, a cauliflower by 20% and pears by 23%. And away from food, the figures showed increases of 12 to 15% year-on-year in materials for DIY, household furniture, bicycles, garden and camping equipment, fiction books and stuff for babies. Many of our household appliances come from the European Union, and they're up by more, possibly because of the extra hassle in getting them across the Channel. An iron is 21% more expensive than last year, says the ONS. But it's energy that brings the most pain. Along with food, it's not a discretionary spend. So to have both those factors rising puts particular pressure on lower income households. The wholesale cost of natural gas for delivery this winter has soared from below 50p a therm last summer, to highs of £3 in October and rising well above £4 in December. This week, it is trading below £2, but that's still four times the cost that our bills are currently assuming. The cost will be passed on. In bills between April and October last year, the typical gas-heated household was paying £373 on an annual basis, out of a total bill of £1,138. The heat was on with the price cap rise last October, where that wholesale gas element went up to £528 out of £1,277 for the year. But that was when the price spikes began, and they feed this April's increase. The regulator, Ofgem, is required to pass the average cost on, meaning a doubling of that wholesale element. The rest of the bill is made up of the cost of the cables and wiring that gets power to your home, social and green levies to support low-income households and subsidise renewable power, plus administration costs and 5% VAT. A constrained level of profit is allowed, currently at £23 on the typical dual fuel bill. That's what makes this inflation spike so predictable. We we already know months in advance the scale of the rise of one key element of household spending, and we can foresee the impact that has through the delay in the price control mechanism. What we don't know is how long that will continue. The price of gas depends on global demand, and supply could be severely disrupted by war between Ukraine and Russia. European storage of gas is at record lows, and Britain has little storage. We do know that the bills are yet to come in for rescuing millions of customers whose suppliers went bust. That came at a cost to the remaining suppliers, and they are expecting compensation with the next price cap rise, six months from now. The other element we do not know is how people on tight household budgets are going to handle price rises on that scale - even after UK and Scottish governments have provided some mitigation measures. Fuel poverty is alarmingly high in Scotland. That includes people who spend more than 10% of their disposable income on household energy, leaving insufficient for an acceptable standard of living. That can be because of low income, or because of poorly insulated housing or health conditions which bring high heating requirements. The most recent Scottish government statistics from 2019 show: Nearly a quarter of homes were in that position, or 613,000 households. One in eight homes, or 311,000, were living in extreme fuel poverty, meaning more than 20% of income was going on household fuel. In the most remote rural areas, 43% of households were in fuel poverty. Across all rural households, 19% were in extreme fuel poverty. Fuel poverty was experienced by 37% of those in the social rented sector, and 20% of those in private housing, including renters.\nThose heating homes with electricity were much more likely to be in fuel poverty than those using gas, by 43% to 22%, along with 28% of those using oil heating. A watchdog that monitors actions to recover personal debt have noticed a rise already, reflecting widespread problems in retaining earnings through the pandemic. It is braced for a lot more. There is a knock-on effect for businesses that depend on discretionary spend - life's unnecessary luxuries, from fashion to travel and eating out - when so much more money is going on the basics back at home. Those poverty figures fluctuate widely from year to year, mainly because of the varying cost of fuel. And this year, we can expect fuel poverty, like too much wasted heat - will go through the roof.

            "content": "Spotify's boss says it is \"too early to know\" how the controversy over Joe Rogan's podcast, which averages 11m listeners an episode, has hit the firm. Musicians, including Neil Young and Joni Mitchell, asked for their music to be removed from the platform after criticism that the US broadcaster has helped to spread Covid misinformation. It comes as Spotify projected slower subscriber growth for this quarter. The streaming company's shares fell by more than 10% in after-hours trading. \"Usually when we've had controversies in the past, those are measured in months, not days,\" Spotify's chief executive Daniel Ek told investors. \"We don't change our policies based on one creator, nor do we change based on any media cycle or calls from anyone else,\" he added. The company said revenue for the last three months of 2021 rose to 2.69bn euros (£2.2bn; $3bn), easily beating market expectations. However, the firm missed analysts' predictions as it forecast that it would have 183m paying subscribers this quarter. Spotify added that the outlook was \"subject to substantial uncertainty\" due to the pandemic. Four claims from Joe Rogan's podcast fact-checked\nJoe Rogan pledges to try harder after Spotify row This week, Spotify said it was working to add advisory warnings to any podcast discussing Covid-19. The company also made public rules which give it the power to remove or suspend users and podcasts that promote dangerous falsehoods. These are similar to those adopted by social media platforms Facebook, YouTube and Twitter. Mr Ek said the advisory will direct listeners to a resource hub with facts, information from experts, and \"links to trusted sources\". \"This new effort to combat misinformation will roll out to countries around the world in the coming days,\" he said. \"To our knowledge, this content advisory is the first of its kind by a major podcast platform.\" Mr Rogan also pledged to try harder to offer more balanced views on his podcast. In an almost 10-minute long Instagram video posted on Monday, he said he would \"try harder to get people with differing opinions\" on his show. The BBC is not responsible for the content of external sites.\nView original tweet on Twitter The announcements came after several musicians and podcasters asked for their content to be taken off Spotify. Last week, Neil Young and Joni Mitchell had their music removed from the streaming platform. They were followed by Soul musician India Arie and British singer-songwriter Graham Nash, with India Arie saying her decision was partly due to Mr Rogan's \"language around race\". Mary Trump, the niece of former US President Donald Trump, has said she had also deleted her podcast from Spotify. \"I know it's not a big deal but hope it will be part of a growing avalanche,\" she said on Twitter.

            "content": "Social media giant Facebook has seen its daily active users (DAUs) drop for the first time in its 18-year history. Facebook's owner Meta Platforms says DAUs fell to 1.929bn in the three months to the end of December, compared to 1.930bn in the previous quarter. The firm also warned of slowing revenue growth in the face of competition from rivals like TikTok and YouTube, while advertisers are also cutting spending. Meta's shares slumped by more than 20% in after-hours trading in New York. The slide in Meta's share price wiped around $200bn (£147.5bn) off the company's stock market value. Shares in other social media platforms, including Twitter, Snap and Pinterest, also fell sharply in extended trading. Chief executive Mark Zuckerberg said the firm's sales growth had been hurt as audiences, especially younger users, had left for rivals. Meta, which owns the world's second biggest digital advertising platform after Google, also said it had been hit by privacy changes on Apple's operating system. The changes have made it harder for brands to target and measure their advertising on Facebook and Instagram and could have an impact \"in the order of $10 billion\" for this year, according to Meta's chief financial officer Dave Wehner. Meta's total revenue, the bulk of which comes from advertising sales, rose to $33.67bn in the period, narrowly beating market predictions. It also forecast revenues of between $27bn to $29bn for the next quarter, which is lower than analysts had expected. While the company has been making its own investments in video to compete with TikTok -owned by Chinese tech giant ByteDance - it makes less money from those offerings than its traditional Facebook and Instagram feeds. Facebook changes its name to Meta in major rebrand\nMeta monopoly case given go-ahead in US Mr Zuckerberg said he was confident the investments in video and virtual reality would pay off, as previous bets on mobile advertising and Instagram stories have. But, he noted, the firm didn't have to contend with a major rival during previous shifts in strategy. \"The teams are executing quite well and the product is growing very quickly,\" he said. \"The thing that is somewhat unique here is that TikTok is so big a competitor already and also continues to grow at quite a fast rate.\" Facebook has always been a platform that grows. For every quarter in its existence the global numbers have been in one direction. Yet in the last few years, growth has stalled in Europe and US. That was masked by rises in users from the rest of the world. Facebook just isn't as popular with younger people as it was. By its own admission, TikTok is hurting business. But there are other reasons too that investors are worried about Meta. Meta changed its name because it wanted to focus on the Metaverse. But Meta is nowhere near building a Metaverse yet, it's a pipedream at the moment. Instead it is pumping billions of dollars into trying to create one - all because Mark Zuckerberg thinks there's an appetite for it - a huge risk. Perhaps the answer to Meta's immediate problems would be to buy TikTok? Well US regulators would never allow that due to anti-competition laws. And Facebook is now seen by many in Silicon Valley as a poisonous brand. It's certainly not a cool place to work in the same way it was say ten years ago. That makes attracting talent more difficult. Meta has some serious problems going forward. This milestone could be just the beginning. ",

            "content": "Pret a Manger is raising the price of its coffee subscription service to £25 a month prompting criticism from some of its customers. The High Street chain said ingredients and staff costs were rising, and that VAT was about to go back up. Some subscribers, who were previously paying £20 a month for up to five \"barista-prepared\" drinks per day took to Twitter to complain. But others said the subscription still represented value for money. The 25% price rise will come into effect from Thursday for new subscribers, and from 16 March for people who already have a subscription. Pret created the subscription service in a bid to win back business lost during lockdowns. It created an initial buzz on social media, but some customers complained that popular drinks weren't always available and former Pret staff said the scheme's popularity had left some workers feeling overwhelmed by their workload. A Pret spokesperson said: \"Since we launched the Pret coffee subscription in 2020, prices for ingredients such as coffee beans and milk have gone up, VAT is increasing to 20%, and we've invested in additional pay for Pret Team members. \"We believe the coffee subscription continues to offer great value.\" However Twitter user Sam Anton wrote: \"This isn't acceptable. You can't put prices up without consultation, especially when the quality of produce is deteriorating. I'll be cancelling my subscription. Disappointing.\" The BBC is not responsible for the content of external sites.\nView original tweet on Twitter Other customers described it as \"bad news\" and some said they were cancelling their membership. But other customers said the subscription still represented value for money. Twitter user Jodie Portugal wrote: \"Just received an email from #pret stating that my subscription will be increased to £25 a month for 5 drinks a day, which by itself would be about £150+, so for the cost of an extra drink and croissant I still save a fortune.\" The BBC is not responsible for the content of external sites.\nView original tweet on Twitter Another customer tweeted they'd be prepared to pay £40 for the subscription. Pret said in an email to customers that of the extra £5 charge, about £2 will cover VAT, £1.50 would go on paying staff more, and £1.50 will offset inflation. The sandwich chain announced in January that it was going to boost pay for thousands of workers to £10 per hour. In addition, in April the tax people pay when they buy goods and services - VAT - is set to return to 20% after being cut during the pandemic. As an employer Pret will also have a larger National Insurance bill to pay from April, following the government's move to raise NI rates to fund NHS and social care spending. Pret uses Arabica coffee beans, and the price Pret pays for these has risen by 40% from 2020 levels, while the cost of milk has also gone up, it said. ",

            "content": "Shoppers have been hit by the highest price rises in nearly 10 years after shop inflation almost doubled over the past month, data suggests. Shop price inflation jumped from 0.8% in December to 1.5% in January, the BRC-NielsenIQ price index indicated. The sharp rise was driven by non-food price increases, which included furniture and flooring in high demand. Many families have been struggling with a cost of living crisis as fuel prices and energy bills soar. The latest official figures showed inflation at its highest rate for 30 years. Non-food inflation rose to 0.9% in January after falling by 0.2% in December, while food inflation accelerated to 2.7% in January, up from 2.4% in December. Helen Dickinson, chief executive of the British Retail Consortium (BRC), said January saw shop price inflation nearly double, \"driven by a sharp rise in non-food inflation\". \"In particular, furniture and flooring saw exceptionally high demand leading to increased prices as the rising oil costs made shipping more expensive,\" she added. \"Food prices continue to rise, especially domestic produce which have been [hit] by poor harvests, labour shortages, and rising global food prices.\" Ms Dickinson also said this would directly affect households' cost of living as \"it would be impossible to protect consumers from any future rises\" in costs. The BRC and research firm NielsenIQ measured inflation in retailers in the UK in the first week of January, looking at price changes in 500 commonly bought items. It said that shop price rises were the highest since December 2012. Global rising energy prices, supply problems and higher shipping costs are hitting retailers, with many costs being passed on to consumers. Staff shortages are a particular problem in the UK, due to Brexit and the pandemic, and are prompting some employers to raise wages, which can contribute to inflation. What is the UK's inflation rate and why is the cost of living going up?\nWhy are gas prices so high and what is happening to fuel bills? Construction supply firm Timco told BBC Radio 4's Today programme it had seen its raw materials and shipping costs increase over the past 18 months. The firm said it used to pay about $1,000 (£739) for a shipping container, but was now having to pay \"north of $10,000\". Alex Stephens, Timco's finance director, said: \"Back then, the cost of shipping as a percentage of an overall product might have been low, a single-digit percent, now I would say it's somewhere between 20% and 50% of the pricing. \"We are currently bringing in containers from the Far East where the shipping cost is pretty much the same as the cost of the materials that we are bringing in,\" he said. \"To be honest, nothing has gotten any better. If anything, things at the moment are getting worse.\" Increasing wholesale costs have also led to predictions that annual food bills could rise by £180 on average, according to consultants Kantar. It said annual grocery inflation was 3.8% over the past four weeks, up from 3.5% in December. In the official figures, sofas and the like come under quite a broad category of \"furniture and household goods\". The ONS points out prices in the sector have been rising steadily since the start of 2021. That includes furniture, household appliances - including the cost of fitting them, and even garden equipment. Furniture prices are rising for many of the same reasons as skincare products and food. The cost of raw materials - such as wood in this case - as well as transporting them has gone up. A settee may be considered a luxury item, and one only bought new after saving up the money. A fridge, on the other hand, is a necessity for every family. Read what else is going up in price and why, here. The UK's inflation rate rose to 5.4% in the 12 months to December, the highest rate for 30 years. However, Jack Monroe, who campaigns on food poverty, has said that the prices of everyday essentials are going up by more than the official inflation rate, hitting the poorest hardest. The Office for National Statistics agreed that \"one inflation rate doesn't fit all\" and said it would soon be publishing a wider variety of cost-of-living metrics. Struggling families are dealing with increases in costs including soaring energy prices after a worldwide squeeze on on gas and energy supplies. Wholesale gas prices have risen to unprecedented levels. At the end of December, they hit a new record of 450p per therm, which experts think could take average annual gas bills to about £2,000 next year. ",

            "content": "India's finance minister has said the country will launch a digital version of the rupee as early as this year. In her annual budget speech, Nirmala Sitharaman also outlined plans for a 30% tax on income from digital assets. It would put profits from trading or transferring cryptocurrencies and non-fungible tokens in the country's highest tax band. India is the latest major economy to announce an official virtual currency, as China trials the digital yuan. \"Introduction of a central bank digital currency will give a boost, a big boost to (the) digital economy,\" Ms Sitharaman said on Tuesday. \"Digital currency will also lead to a more efficient and cheaper currency management system,\" she added. Ms Sitharaman also said the magnitude and frequency of digital asset transactions \"have made it imperative to provide for a specific tax regime\", where profits from transactions are taxed. The tax would also apply to gifts of digital assets, with recipients being liable to pay the levy. Taxes for all other transactions would be deducted at source. The announcement came as Ms Sitharaman unveiled the Indian federal government's annual budget. It included ramping up spending on infrastructure and extended credit guarantees to struggling small businesses. Asia's third largest economy has been hit hard by the pandemic with major job losses and rising inflation. Did India budget do enough to revive economy?\nUK takes next steps in digital money plan\nChina declares all Bitcoin transactions illegal The announcement that India's central bank would introduce a digital currency comes against the backdrop of the country's demonetisation policy. In 2016, Prime Minister Narendra Modi gave just four hours' notice before 500 rupee (£4.94) and 1,000 rupee banknotes were withdrawn from the financial system. Meanwhile, China has been trialling the digital yuan ahead of this month's winter Olympics and has banned cryptocurrency trading and mining. In the UK, The Bank of England and the Treasury are exploring a potential central bank digital currency. India's plan to introduce a digital rupee was welcomed by cryptocurrency traders. Sumit Gupta, co-founder and chief executive of India-based cryptocurrency exchange CoinDCX, told the BBC that the initiative \"has given legitimacy to virtual digital assets\". Mr Gupta also said that he thinks taxing digital assets would be good for the market but believes the rate is too high. \"A tax rate of 30% is on par with that imposed on gains from speculative activities like lottery, gambling and other gaming activities. That proposed 30% might act as a dampener for greater adoption,\" he said. In 2018, the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) banned the trading of cryptocurrencies. The bank had previously issued several warnings about the \"economic, financial, operational, legal, consumer protection and security-related risks\" of virtual currencies such as Bitcoin. However, the ban was overturned by the country's supreme court two years later. In November, the government signalled that it was preparing to crack down on most cryptocurrencies in the country under a long-awaited bill. It said at the time that the planned legislation was aimed \"to create a facilitative framework for the creation of the official digital currency to be issued by the Reserve Bank of India\".

            "content": "Tech giant Amazon has announced 1,500 new apprenticeships across the UK. The 40 schemes range from engineering to health and safety and includes more than 200 apprenticeships which are degree level. Amazon employs more than 70,000 staff in the UK and said the scheme would help more people get the skills in demand in the job market. BT Group recently announced plans to recruit more than 600 apprentices and graduates for September 2022. The group, one of the UK's largest private sector apprenticeship employers, said it would recruit for posts in its engineering, customer service, applied research, and cyber-security areas. The people moving from high to low-carbon careers\nUniversities to get job targets for poor students\nBarclays opens major new financial hub in Glasgow The latest recruitment drive for both companies comes as firms in the UK and the US report growing problems filling skilled roles. Amazon has also previously offered a signing-on bonus of £1,000 to fill some roles. Amazon's apprenticeships programme covers a wide range of areas including publishing, retailing, marketing, and a programme focused on environmental, social and corporate governance. The firm's UK country manager John Boumphrey, said Amazon was \"proud\" to have created the 1,500 apprenticeships which would \"help even more people get the skills that are in demand in today's labour market.\" He added: \"We want to be the employer that helps people take their careers to the next level, whether you're just starting your first job or making a career change, in every community that we serve across the UK.\" Business Secretary Kwasi Kwarteng, said the announcement is \"testament to the strength of the British economy, with GDP back at pre-pandemic levels, employee numbers at record highs and unemployment falling\". He added: \"With the vast majority of Amazon's workforce located outside of London and the South East, these additional 25,000 jobs highlight the success of our Plan for Jobs in helping to ensure greater opportunities across the country.\" Stephen Isherwood, chief executive of the Institute of Student Employers, told the BBC the move \"reflects what we hear from many employers, that apprentice training routes deliver an increasingly important source of talent.\" However, Mr Isherwood said the government needed to make \"significant improvements\" to the \"patchy careers provision in schools so that students and their parents are more aware of the alternatives to university\". Julian David, chief executive of industry group techUK said that increasing numbers of its members were now offering apprenticeships, but added that the plans the government had set out so far were \"still leaving people behind as technology innovation is accelerating faster than the pipeline of people available to fill the gaps\". The BBC has contacted the Department for Education for a response. \"While the pandemic and remote working have unfortunately slowed down apprenticeship adoption for some companies, it is clear that the sector is aware alternative routes to careers are an answer to today's digital skills crisis,\" Mr David added. For employers who hire apprentices under 20 years old, Mr Isherwood said the government needs to increase the \"financial incentive to recruit\". Another option, he said, would be for the government to allow employers \"greater flexibility in how they spend their levy pot.\" Last year, business group the Chartered Institute of Personnel and Development said that UK employers had lost £2bn over the previous two years in apprenticeship levy funds that they were unable to spend. Last September, Amazon announced it was looking to hire 55,000 staff globally for corporate jobs and roles in robotics, research and engineering. About 40,000 jobs will be in the US, with 2,500 in the UK and the remainder mostly in India, Germany and Japan. ",

Clearance website boss Karl Baxter said - \"in classic Del Boy-style\" - he will pitch them as collectors' items. \"What could be more unique than our limited-edition misprinted crockery?\" he said.

            "content": "Meta's experiment with cryptocurrency, Diem, is shutting down. The Diem Association, which runs the project, announced the sale of assets of the cryptocurrency venture to Slivergate Capital Corporation for $182million. Launched as Libra in 2019, the project quickly ran into opposition from policy-makers. The association said it became clear from \"dialogue with federal regulators\" that the project could not move ahead. \"As a result, the best path forward was to sell the Diem Group's assets, as we have done today to Silvergate,\" Diem chief executive Stuart Levey wrote. The Diem Association is a separate organisation from Facebook, although its funding came from the firm. Facebook intended Diem to be a stablecoin which, as the name implies, is a type of cryptocurrency designed to be less of a financial rollercoaster, its value linked to less volatile assets such as national currencies or commodities. But that did not stop the venture causing concern. \"This is an alternative money,\" Prof Ross Buckley at the University of New South Wales told the BBC in 2019, warning that it was unlikely to get the kind of easy treatment from regulators that an in-game currency might, In a research paper, Prof Buckley and colleagues argued the currency was \"the ultimate example of something that is highly likely to move from 'too small to care' to 'too big to fail' in a very short period of time\". Regulators and politicians did indeed put Diem under the microscope. Facebook's former crypto head and Diem co-creator David Marcus said on Twitter the idea might fare better with a more \"acceptable\" promoter. The BBC is not responsible for the content of external sites.\nView original tweet on Twitter The Financial Times wrote that \"regulator hostility put a stop to the Diem experiment\". Facebook's size, the newspaper argued, meant that Diem was a \"challenge to the status quo\" and it was surprising the firm had not foreseen the problems ahead. But for Diem's Stuart Levey, the technology it developed addressed many key concerns that have emerged as cryptocurrencies have taken off: \"One of our highest priorities in designing the Diem Payment Network was building in controls to protect it against misuse by illicit actors. \"Among these controls was a prohibition on anonymous transactions, which pose both a sanctions and money-laundering risk\". Mr Levey added: \"We look forward to seeing the design choices - and the ideals - of Diem thrive.\" Stephane Kasriel, head of Novi - Meta's digital wallet project - tweeted that the company \"would continue to execute on our existing fintech plans to create economic opportunities and champion greater financial inclusion today, and as we look ahead to the metaverse\".

            "content": "Tesco has warned 1,600 jobs are at risk as it ends overnight restocking at some stores and converts some petrol sites to pay-at-pump during the night. The supermarket's plans come a day after it announced the closure of its Jack's discount stores. It said restocking shelves during the day would mean more staff could be on the shop floor at peak times. Tesco boss Jason Tarry said the move would help it to run the business as \"simply and efficiently as possible\". Overnight restocking will switch to the daytime in 36 big stores and 49 convenience stores. The chain also plans to convert petrol stations in 36 stores to pay-at-pump only during overnight hours. \"We operate in a highly competitive and fast-paced market, and our customers are shopping differently, especially since the start of the pandemic,\" said Mr Tarry. \"We are always looking at how we can run our business as simply and efficiently as possible, so that we can reinvest in the things that matter most to customers.\" This is just the latest in a series of restructurings at Tesco. Over the last few years it's changed or axed thousands of roles as it overhauls the way it runs its stores to try to create a simpler business. All its big rivals have done the same as they try to compete with Aldi and Lidl. And, of course, our shopping habits have changed. Tesco, and all the grocers, have enjoyed bumper sales at Christmas and throughout the pandemic but they're all facing rising costs ranging from raw materials and freight to wage increases. Last autumn Tesco announced it would make one billion pounds of savings over three years, to help offset inflation and to invest in the business to stay competitive. Managing costs is going to be one of the biggest headaches for retailers this year and, like Tesco, they will all be looking at ways to become more efficient. News of the shake-up comes after Tesco's announcement on Monday that it planned to close its Jack's discount stores and shut meat, fish and deli counters in 315 Tesco stores. Daniel Adams, national officer at retail trade union Usdaw, said: \"Tesco has informed us that they are looking to undertake a number of restructures across the business that could put around 1,600 jobs at risk. Clearly this will be incredibly unsettling for those who may be affected.\" \"We should not forget the role that key workers have played throughout the Coronavirus pandemic and to receive this news is devastating.\" In a statement, Tesco said it had about 3,000 vacancies elsewhere in the business and it aimed to \"offer alternative roles at Tesco for as many colleagues as we can\".

            "content": "A fresh deal has been struck to keep supplies of vital industrial-grade carbon dioxide (CO2) flowing by keeping a key production site open. When CF Industries' plant at Billingham shut briefly last year, it caused a crisis, threatening CO2 supplies to the food, medical and nuclear sectors. At the time, the company said that high natural gas prices made the plant unviable. A three-month deal allowing it to continue operating expired on Monday. But the government said major CO2 users have now reached a new agreement with CF Industries. Details of the deal have not been disclosed, but the BBC understands it will last until at least spring and come at no cost to the taxpayer. \"The carbon dioxide industry has come to an agreement to ensure UK businesses have access to a sustainable supply of CO2 - an essential component of the national economy,\" the business department said in a statement. \"The deal will enable CF Fertilisers' Billingham plant to continue to operate while global gas prices remain high. It means key sectors, including food processing and nuclear power, are ensured supplies of CO2.\" Concerns over food shortages as CO2 deal ends In September, the government provided financial support to reopen Billingham. A deal was then struck between CF Industries and its customers to keep the plant open for three months without further subsidies. The Food and Drink Federation (FDF) had warned that without an extension of that deal, CO2 supplies could be interrupted, leading to food shortages on shelves. \"UK food and drink manufacturers welcome the deal that will ensure continuity of CO2 supply, keeping our shops, pubs and restaurants stocked with our favourite food and drink,\" said Kate Halliwell, Chief Scientific Officer at the FDF. CO2 is used in fizzy drinks, to keep packaged food fresh and to stun livestock before slaughter. The UK continues to face soaring wholesale gas prices which have driven up costs for businesses and households. The price of ammonia - which CF Industries uses to generate CO2 as a by-product - is currently at a record high, nearly double the level seen in September. By Ben King, business reporter The deal guarantees supply for the next few months, but it doesn't resolve fundamental issues with the UK's supply of carbon dioxide. Industrial-grade CO2 is made as a by-product of other industrial processes, such as the production of ammonia for fertiliser production, or bioethanol for fuel. The UK relies on CF Industries for 60% of its CO2 needs, and most of that comes from the Billingham plant on Teesside. When that goes down, it is difficult to replace. The UK faced a CO2 supply crisis in 2018, and another last year. Industrial-grade CO2 is difficult to store, and expensive to transport. And while many industrial processes produce CO2, few generate a stream pure and reliable enough to use in food. The government said it would like to see \"the market take measures to improve resilience\", and the Food and Drink Federation said it would boost its \"efforts to build resilience\". Unless those efforts succeed, the UK may well face another CO2 supply crisis. ",

            "content": "House prices have risen at the fastest annual pace for a January in 17 years, amid \"robust\" demand and low supply, according to lender Nationwide. The building society said prices rose by 11.2% year-on-year and by 0.8% between December and January. Affordability is already a key issue with house prices rising much faster than wages throughout the pandemic. Nationwide said a deposit now constitutes a record percentage of a first-time buyer's salary. \"A 10% deposit on a typical first-time buyer home is now equivalent to 56% of total gross annual earnings, a record high,\" said the building society's chief economist, Robert Gardner. \"Similarly, a typical mortgage payment as a share of take-home pay is now above the long-run average, despite mortgage rates remaining close to all-time lows.\" UK house prices rose fastest for 17 years in 2021 Average house price hits record high of £255,000 How the interest rate rise affects you The average price of a property in the UK was £255,556 in last month - up from £254,822 in December - as demand remained \"robust,\" Mr Gardner said. \"Mortgage approvals for house purchase have continued to run slightly above pre-pandemic levels, despite the surge in activity in 2021 as a result of the stamp duty holiday, which encouraged buyers to bring forward their transactions to avoid additional tax. \"Indeed, the total number of property transactions in 2021 was the highest since 2007 and around 25% higher than in 2019, before the pandemic struck. \"At the same time, the stock of homes on estate agents' books has remained extremely low, which is contributing to the continued robust pace of house price growth.\" However, the Nationwide predicts the increase in house prices will slow this year as property becomes less affordable. Mr Gardner said the outlook for the housing market \"remains uncertain\", but house price growth had \"outstripped earnings growth by a wide margin since the pandemic struck\". He added that with interest rates expected to rise in the coming months affordability could be hit further. The Bank of England raised its key interest rate to 0.25% in December, and it is expected to make further increases this year. The Bank's Monetary Policy Committee is due to make its next announcement on rates on Thursday. \"This will further reduce housing affordability if it feeds through to higher mortgage rates, although to date a significant proportion of the rise in longer term interest rates seen in recent months has been absorbed by lenders,\" Mr Gardner said. Mr Gardner said reduced affordability would be likely to dampen market activity and house price growth this year \"especially since household finances are also coming under pressure from sharp increases in the cost of living\"- with inflation hitting 5.4% in December, its fastest pace since 1992, and set to rise further in the coming months as energy prices go up.

Since its move from its former site at Cardington airfield in 2018, it has been looking for a manufacturing base. Nick Allman, from HAV, said it had a \"bright future\" and had identified \"three customers\". The craft, when built, will be about 320ft (98m) long. Its previous prototype, which was 302ft (92m) long and cost £32m, carried out six successful test flights between 2016 and 2017, before being retired after breaking its moorings and self-deflating in November 2017. Mr Allman, HAV's chief operating officer, said it had worked with the South Yorkshire Mayoral Combined Authority (SYMCA), Doncaster Metropolitan Borough Council, and other stakeholders on the proposed move. The exact location, or when work could start at the new site, has not been revealed. \"We've spent a few years really focusing on how how we're going to make the company significantly larger and build an aircraft on a scale that hasn't been seen for years, or ever, in terms of hybrid aircraft,\" said Mr Allman. Mr Allman said the company had looked around Bedford and the rest of the country and it had now \"worked out a place that looks really suitable\". \"We see a very bright future.

Annual grocery inflation was 3.8% over the past four weeks, up from 3.5% in December, Kantar found. Sales of savoury snacks, fresh beef and crisps rose last month, while beer, bacon and vitamins fell Dry January and Veganuary boosted sales of vegan and low alcohol products. Fraser McKevitt, head of retail and consumer insight at Kantar, said: \"Prices are rising on many fronts, and the weekly shop is no exception. \"Like-for-like grocery price inflation, which assumes that shoppers buy exactly the same products this year as they did last year, increased again this month. \"Taken over the course of a 12-month period, this 3.8% rise in prices could add an extra £180 to the average household's annual grocery bill. \"We're now likely to see shoppers striving to keep costs down by searching for cheaper products and promotions. Supermarkets that can offer the best value stand to win the biggest slice of spend.\" Separate figures from the Office for National Statistics (ONS) show two-thirds of people surveyed in January said their cost of living had risen in December. Of these, 87% said the price of their food shop had increased, and 79% said gas and electricity prices were a factor. Jack Monroe hails inflation-measure shake-up\nInflation surge sends UK interest payments higher Consumer price inflation is at a 30-year high of 5.4%, according to the ONS, and is predicted by the Bank of England to reach about 6% by April. The Bank of England raised its key interest rate in December in a bid to tackle inflationary pressures, and many analysts expect another rate increase from the Bank later this week. Mr McKevitt added that the end of lockdown rules meant pre-pandemic shopping patterns were starting to return. The return to the office saw an increase in sales of personal hygiene sales, Kantar found, with razor blade sales up 14% and deodorant up 20%. There was also strong growth in plant-based products, with shoppers embracing vegan diets in January. About 10.7 million households bought at least one dairy-free or meat-free alternative. Last month also saw a 5% increase in no- or low-alcohol drinks, as consumers taking part in Dry January avoided alcohol. With more shoppers visiting supermarkets, there were heavy falls in online grocery sales last month, Kantar said. Online purchases were down 15% year-on-year. But online orders remain above pre-pandemic levels, with orders accounting for 12.5% of all grocery spending. A survey of 4,500 people in January by the ONS found that 66% of those asked said that the cost of living had risen in the previous month. A third of those who said their cost of living had risen said they were cutting back on their use of gas and electricity. Energy regulator Ofgem will increase its price cap further in April, which is expected to add hundreds of pounds to domestic annual energy bills. When energy bills go up, poorer households are harder hit. Latest ONS figures show that, in the year to the April 2020, the poorest 10% spent 54% of their average weekly expenditure on essentials, such as housing - including energy bills - food and transport. The richest 10% spent 42% of their average weekly spending on the same essentials. In the ONS survey, just over half said they were cutting back on non-essentials as the cost of living goes up.

            "header": "Will travel return to normal this summer?",
            "content": "Airlines and tour operators are racing to boost staff numbers in the hope receding travel rules will trigger a summer holiday boom. The UK will remove all travel testing requirements for fully-vaccinated people next Friday. However, travel agents say destinations' Covid rules are still putting some Brits off, and many continue to book last minute. There are also warnings of recruitment struggles as the industry ramps up. On Monday, Ryanair's Michael O'Leary was the latest travel boss to predict a strong bounce-back, as people return to going on holiday. He said that for summer 2022, airline expected to put on 115% of the capacity it had done in 2019. Ryanair is recruiting and training 1,000 new pilots and 2,000 cabin crew. However, he warned that much depended on Covid developments and said: \"I think being cautious is the sensible way forward.\" Some other travel businesses have also said they expect to put on a summer offering at least as big as before Covid. The airline and a tour operator Jet2 told the BBC earlier this month it was planning a larger summer holiday package this year than in 2019. It is selling more seats on an expanded fleet of planes in the expectation of high demand, and recruiting for more than 1,700 roles. These include roles in ground operations in the UK and overseas, cabin crew, and office staff. How are travel rules being relaxed?\nWhere do I need to use a Covid passport? The chief executive of EasyJet, Johan Lundgren, said pent-up demand should push summer capacity near to 2019 levels. EasyJet is recruiting 1,500 seasonal cabin crew, and plans to recruit 1,000 pilots over the next five years. British Airways, which has cut about a quarter of its staff - 10,000 roles - since the pandemic began, has recently been looking to hire thousands of cabin crew with a view to ramping up services. This includes inviting back some staff who previously left but expressed an interest in returning. The carrier is looking for hundreds more for its new Gatwick short-haul subsidiary, which is due to launch at the end of March. The UK's biggest tour operator, TUI, is also recruiting cabin crew for what it expects to be a busy summer. Julia Lo Bue-Said, chief executive of independent travel agent network Advantage Travel Partnership, said consumer confidence still needed to improve for a bumper summer to materialise. She said many people were nervous about booking trips far in advance in case rules changed again, and complicated Covid regulations for entering popular destinations such as Spain were still putting families off. \"A third of everything being sold [by our members] is currently classed as late departures, so travelling before the end of March. That's unusual,\" she continued. \"40% of what you'd normally be selling now would be in school holidays - at the moment it's more like 15%.\" She also believes a significant proportion of those travelling this summer will have postponed from last year - or even 2020. However, Dame Irene Hays, chair of Hays Travel, said a lot of customers were booking last minute, but the summer season was \"by far the number one\". Since the second week of January, Dame Irene said Hays Travel had seen increases week on week, the biggest of which came after last Monday's announcement that the UK would scrap travel tests for the fully-vaccinated. Dame Irene said this was the same as the equivalent weekend in 2020, which she described as remarkable. \"The majority of short-haul holiday bookings are for Spain, Turkey and Greece, but there's also been a phenomenal increase in long-haul holidays for a longer duration,\" she added. \"People are now ready for the holidays many are taking the opportunity to spend more on a holiday that's been worth waiting for.\" ABTA, a trade association for travel agents and tour operators, said its members had reported an increase in activity following the relaxation of the UK's travel restrictions. However, the group feels it's still too early to say for certain what the summer will look like. ABTA spokesperson Emma Brennan said that, like many other sectors, the travel industry was experiencing challenges with recruitment. \"The pandemic led to hundreds of thousands of jobs being lost, with many people making a move to other sectors. As a sector we now need to face the challenge of enticing them back and attracting new talent.\" Aviation is among the industries to have suffered most during the pandemic, shedding thousands of jobs. The recruitment site Indeed.com said vacancies in the industry only returned to pre-pandemic levels in December 2021, before nose-diving again, as a result of Omicron. It said there were now signs of a rebound. James Reed, the chairman of recruiter Reed.co.uk, said the scramble to hire more workers to cope with the British public's pent-up demand for travel had created a jobs boom. However, like other industries, he said the aviation sector faced labour shortages. \"The current labour market is a sellers' market, not a buyers' market, meaning jobseekers hold all the cards and it is down to the employers to make themselves as attractive as possible to new talent.\" Ryanair's Michael O'Leary said he did not generally see staffing issues affecting the ramping up of operations, although \"there are pockets\". Other modes of travel have also expressed optimism about the coming months. Saga said last week cruise bookings were strong for 2022 and 2023. ",

            "content": "With rising energy costs set to push gas and electricity bills even higher, the government is looking at ways to soften the blow. But what route, if any, will it take? It's my understanding that Chancellor Rishi Sunak is considering a multi-billion pound intervention of a temporary and targeted nature, aimed at mitigating the coming record rises for the most vulnerable households. It would be an \"energy price-based\" intervention, not a tax or benefit-based one. So that rules out the cut to VAT on energy bills called for by the Labour party. A temporary intervention can be justified on the basis that most of the factors pushing up energy prices are freakish one-offs - from the mismatches in supply that followed the lifting of pandemic restrictions, to the geopolitical tensions with Russia. The open question is just how targeted this intervention will be. Why are gas prices so high?\nHow other countries are dealing with the energy crisis On its current trajectory, the energy price cap, which limits what providers can charge consumers, is likely to rise to close to £2,000 a year for dual fuel customers using a typical amount of energy. That will treble the number of households under \"fuel stress\", in other words spending more than a tenth of their income on energy, to 6.3 million. One way to help this group would be to widen the Warm Home Discount (WHD) scheme, which sees £140 automatically taken off the annual energy bills of anyone receiving pension credit. It is currently funded by increasing everyone else's bills. There is talk of doubling the WHD and then extending it to working-age households receiving Universal Credit. If the taxpayer met that £2-3bn cost for a year, then the policy could have an impact, but it would require big changes to the WHD system. Another option for the government would be to look at green levies. Everyone's energy bills contain about £200 of levies annually to support green energy and social support schemes. If the taxpayer stepped in for a year to fund these commitments, it could turn the heat down on those rising energy prices, but this policy is much harder to target. Yet another option would be some sort of smoothing mechanism to support energy companies with loans, known as a \"Cost Deferral Mechanism\". It could operate with or without help from the Treasury or the Bank of England, but British Gas-owner Centrica is not a fan, having described it as a \"bailout\". It is unclear, however, why it does not think asking the taxpayer to shoulder renewable and social levy obligations is not also a bailout. The Treasury is likely to announce any decision on support before the regulator Ofgem unveils the new price cap next Monday, so the chancellor and the Prime Minister will have to come to an agreement imminently.

The move will affect 130 jobs but Tesco said it will try and find alternative roles for the staff affected. Tesco also said that meat, fish and deli counters at 317 store sites would be also be shut down because of changes in customer demand. It launched Jack's in 2018 to tackle the threat from rivals Aldi and Lidl. Tesco said that Jack's had enabled it to bring in new customers from other supermarkets. Jason Tarry, chief executive of Tesco UK and Ireland, said: \"We have learnt a huge amount from Jack's and this has helped Tesco become more competitive, more efficient and strengthened our value proposition, including through the launch of Aldi price match.\" Christmas sales soar for Marks & Spencer and Tesco\nTesco depot staff suspend pre-Christmas pay strikes \"In turn, this has enabled us to consistently attract new customers to Tesco from our competitors over the last two years and we know they increasingly recognise the value they can find at Tesco,\" he added. Chief executive Dave Lewis claimed that Jack's - named after Tesco founder Sir Jack Cohen - would be cheaper than Aldi or Lidl. Jack's stores sold 2,600 products - far fewer than the 35,000 carried by a Tesco supermarket - with 1,800 branded \"Jack's\". In the first six months after the launch, Tesco had planned between 10 and 15 Jack's stores for new locations, next to existing Tesco stores, and a small number of converted Tesco stores but a total of 13 were built. The seven sites which will be closed are in Hull, St Helen's, Walton, Castle Bromwich, Middlewich, Barnsley and Liverpool North. The sites which will be transferred to large Tesco stores are in Chatteris, Immingham, Edgehill, Rubery, Sheffield and Wakefield. Staff working on the meat, fish and hot deli counters listed for closure in 317 of Tesco's stores will also be offered different roles. The supermarket chain said the changes will \"ensure\" Tesco remains \"focused and competitive in a fast-changing market\". \"With the learnings from Jack's now applied, the time is right to focus on ensuring we continue to deliver the best possible value for customers in our core business,\" Mr Tarry added. Tesco saw sales soar over Christmas and forecasted strong full-year profits in January. It said it expects annual income to hit the top end of forecasts at £2.6bn. Tesco's Christmas sales in the UK rose by 0.3% compared to the previous year and were 9.2% higher than the pre-pandemic festive period in 2019. ",

            "header": "Wine drinkers face higher prices and less choice, firm warns",
            "content": "Proposed changes to alcohol duty will lead to higher prices and less choice for wine drinkers, the owner of wine merchant Laithwaites has warned. The proposals, contained in October's Budget, were described by Chancellor Rishi Sunak as the \"most radical simplification of alcohol duties for over 140 years\". But Direct Wines said the complexity would be \"crippling\" for the trade. It said small and medium firms would \"probably go out of business\". In the Budget, the chancellor said that under the new system for alcohol duty, which is due to start in 2023, taxes on sparkling wine, draught beer and cider would be cut, but would rise for stronger drinks such as red wine. According to the Wine and Spirit Trade Association (WSTA), if wine is taxed according to its alcoholic strength in this way, 70% of all wine, still and sparkling, will go up in price, as will 80% of all still wine, 95% of red wine and 100% of fortified wines. The government's consultation on the proposals has just closed. A spokesperson from the Treasury said that for all wines with an ABV between 8.5% and 22%, there will be one band based on alcohol content. \"Our reforms will replace our outdated rules with a common-sense approach that puts the taxation of stronger beers, wines and spirits on an equal footing, making lighter and sparkling wines more affordable for UK drinkers\", they said. Speaking to the BBC's Today programme, the treasurer of Direct Wines, Tim Curtis, said that under the present system there were three rates of duty on wine: one for still wine, a slightly higher one for sparkling wine and a higher one for fortified wine. \"So it's just three numbers and the majority of still wines sold in the UK, it's £2.23 a bottle, it couldn't really be much simpler,\" he said. \"But the Treasury have had a go and they've created 13 wine bands for the same £2.23, so for every half a percent of alcohol increase it goes up about 10p per bottle and above the 15% threshold there's another 14 bands so really they're replacing three with 27.\" The WSTA has calculated implementing the changes would result in an increase in costs of about £250m a year for the wine trade. \"The complexity for the wine trade... is crippling,\" said Mr Curtis. \"Wine is an agricultural product and the ABV (Alcohol by Volume) of wine is set by the amount of sunshine warmth in the vineyard when the grapes grow on the vines and that changes every year. \"Last year we sold over 7,500 different wines and we would need a team of people dedicated to this to track and calculate the correct amount of duty for each product.\" Mr Curtis said the average price of wine would \"certainly go up for the UK consumer\". \"It is the same cost to set up a duty rate for 12 bottles of wine as it is if you're selling a million so inherently for small and medium merchants in the UK this is just going to become an administrative nightmare. \"The red tape is just huge so you can imagine some ranges will shrink and sadly some small and medium enterprises will probably go out of business. So for the consumer it is a case of higher cost, less choice and fewer merchants competing for their business.\" Wine mail order company The Wine Society, which has sales of £130m a year, initially welcomed the government review because it aimed to simplify the duty regime. \"But actually it doesn't simplify it at all,\" said its director of wine Pierre Mansour. He also said that Wine Society members would pay more for their wine as a result of the proposed changes. Most still wines sold by the Society, and in the UK overall, are 11.5% ABV and above. \"That's about 95% of our sales,\" he said. \"And we estimate that with the new taxation customers would end up paying an additional £2m a year in duty, so the cost of wine will increase because the taxation is going to rise.\" Prosecco and pint taxes to fall, red wine to rise\nRishi Sunak's Budget claims fact-checked A spokesman for the chain Majestic Wine said the move would have an effect on the \"day to day pricing of wines that most consumers drink\". It would \"inevitably have an impact on retailers' bottom lines - and whilst we will work hard to minimise the impact this has on our customers, it comes at a very challenging time for the industry\". Similarly, head of wine at the Adnams brewery, which is based in Southwold, Suffolk, said that reduced sales and compromised margins will make this sector \"increasingly unappealing to small business and entrepreneurship\". Increasing three tax bands to more than 20% would add \"complexity and cost to all drinks retailers in the UK. Clearly, we do not see this as simplification and would urge the government to listen to the WSTA and its members to reconsider this move,\" the spokesperson for Majestic Wine added. Instead of the government's proposals, The Wine Society said a simpler approach would be to apply tax bands across categories of alcohol, so any type of alcohol up to 5% ABV would be taxed at the same rate, with this rising for drinks of between 5% and 10% ABV, and so on. Alternatively, most still wine sold in the UK is 8.5%-15% ABV. Mr Mansour said one single tax rate could be applied to all wines in that range, fixing it at the mid-point of the band - so at 12%. ",

            "header": "Concerns over food shortages as CO2 deal ends",
            "content": "UK food and drink firms say they remain concerned about supply shortages as a deal which ensured carbon dioxide (CO2) supplies comes to an end. CO2 is used in fizzy drinks, to keep packaged food fresh and to stun livestock before slaughter. CO2 users agreed a three-month deal in October to keep a key production site open after its owner said high energy prices made it too expensive to run. The arrangement ends on Monday, raising questions over the future of supplies. Industry body the Food and Drink Federation is warning that supermarkets could suffer shortages of some foods if the deal with US firm CF Industries is not extended. Why are gas prices so high?\nWhat's CO2 used for in food and drink?\nFood firms fear CO2 shortages if deal not struck CF Industries, which supplies 60% of the UK's industrial CO2, said it would \"continue to negotiate\" with its customers to \"extend CO2 offtake and pricing agreements\". After previously putting up money to reopen the plant in September, and brokering the October deal, the government has said it is now up to CO2 firms to ensure continued supplies. \"We are continuing to work closely with both the hospitality and food and drink industries, and do not expect any significant disruption to essential food supplies,\" a spokesperson from the Department for Business, Energy and Industrial Strategy said. Last year, CF Industries temporarily shut its facilities at Ince in Cheshire and Billingham on Teessideafter fertiliser manufacturing became uneconomic because of the rising price of natural gas. This resulted in an acute shortage of CO2. Supermarkets began reporting limited stocks of some food items, while the pig industry warned that if slaughterhouses could not process animals, then farmers would have to cull their stocks. CF Industries reopened its Billingham plant in September after the government agreed to provide financial support to keep it running for three weeks. The company agreed to continue supplies of gas until the end of this month -but gave no guarantees beyond that. A Food and Drink Federation spokesperson said that with energy prices \"still very high\", there could be further CO2 shortages which could result in supermarket shortages that would add pressure on to families already coping with high food-price inflation. \"We will continue to work with the government on this,\" the Food and Drink Federation said. \"It is critical that together we ensure supply can continue and that we build long-term resilience into the production of food-grade CO2,\" they added. The British Poultry Council (BPC), which represents producers of half the meat eaten in the UK, said it was \"imperative\" that the government continued to \"honour its commitment\" to food security by ensuring \"little to no disruption\" to supply chains in the event of a CO2 shortage. \"If CO2 continues to be actively prioritised by government for the livestock sector (along with nuclear and healthcare) on the grounds of maintaining food supply and avoiding bird welfare issues, industry can continue to keep food moving,\" a BPC spokesperson added. The market for industrial CO2 - a pure, compressed form of the gas - is a highly unusual one, which is why this problem has been hard to fix. Though supplies are crucial for many food and drink producers, as well as some medical procedures and the nuclear industry, it is only made as a by-product of other processes. So if there is a disturbance to those other industries, the CO2 gets switched off as an unintended consequence. This is what happened last autumn, when the UK's two biggest sources, CF Industries and a bioethanol plant at Wilton on Teesside, were both shut down at once. Fixing the problem has proved tricky. Industrial CO2 is difficult to transport and store, and it is difficult to import much more because there are shortages across Europe. In addition, new production facilities cannot be opened in three months. Tony Will, chief executive of CF Industries, told the Financial Times in September he was \"as surprised as anyone\" to learn how crucial the CO2 he sold was to UK industries. By Ben King, business reporter CF Industries keeps its cards close to its chest. But this winter it might be easier for them to justify keeping the crucial plant at Billingham open, even though gas prices remain high. The CO2 it produces, so vital to so many industries, is made as a by-product from producing ammonia, a chemical used in fertiliser manufacture and other industrial processes. And it's a great time to be making ammonia. World ammonia prices have surged since September, when the government reached into its pocket to convince CF Industries to turn Billingham back on. The global benchmark price, CFR Tampa, has almost doubled to a record high of $1,135 a tonne this month, according to market data provider Independent Commodity Intelligence Services (ICIS). And if war disrupts the 20% of global supply which comes from Russia and Ukraine, prices could go higher still. \"If I was an ammonia producer at the moment, I would want to keep on producing,\" said Richard Ewing, who watches the ammonia market at ICIS. But only CF Industries will know if this is enough to keep Billingham open. ",

            "content": "Co-op shop floor workers have won a key legal argument in a battle to secure equal pay with warehouse staff. More than 1,600 mostly female supermarket workers have been fighting for pay parity with mostly male staff at distribution centres, who are paid up to £3 an hour more. Co-op has conceded a \"comparability concession\", a step towards recognising the different roles are of equal value. But it said its workers were \"fairly\" paid and the battle was far from over. It comes amid similar equal pay battles at rival supermarkets Tesco, Asda, Sainsbury's and Morrisons. Co-op made its concession as a part of an ongoing pay tribunal. Tom Hewitt of solicitors Leigh Day, which is representing the workers, said Co-op shop floor workers had now \"cleared the first hurdle in their claims for equal pay\". \"We hope that Co-op recognises that they can no longer deny that the work store workers do is of equal value to that of their distribution centre colleagues,\" he said. Tesco staff win legal argument in equal pay fight\nCo-op faces equal pay claims from shop workers\nAsda workers win key appeal in equal pay fight The claim began after the mostly female shop floor employees found they were being paid less than men in Co-op's warehouses. This made them feel they were \"underpaid for the same effort\", Leigh Day said. The law firm said Co-op's concession was the first stage in a three-step process that could see the workers reclaiming thousands of pounds of missed back pay. The retailer will now have to show that the roles are not of equal value or that there is a genuine reason for the pay difference which is not based on gender. A Co-op spokesman said: \"Our colleagues play an important role in feeding the nation and it's central to the Co-op's values that we pay them fairly for the work that they do in supporting communities. \"We believe that we pay our colleagues fairly for the roles that they do, and so will continue to defend these claims.\" It is the latest of a number of equal pay fights that could end up costing grocery chains up to an estimated £8bn in back pay claims. In September 2021, an employment tribunal ruled that the roles of Morrisons' store workers could be compared to their colleagues in distribution centres. The case has proceeded to further hearings examining whether store worker and distribution roles are of equal value. In March 2021, a landmark judgment was handed down by the Supreme Court which confirmed that Asda's shop floor workers could compare their roles to those of colleagues in distribution centres for the purposes of equal pay. However, the judge stressed the ruling did not mean the 44,000 claimants had won the right to equal pay, only that they were free to take further legal action. Meanwhile, in June 2021 thousands of Tesco shop floor workers celebrated a European court ruling that an EU law could be relied on in making equal pay claims against their employer. It argues that a worker can be compared with somebody working in a different establishment if a \"single source\" has the power to correct the difference in pay. The Tesco workers, mostly women, had argued that they failed to receive equal pay for work of equal value with colleagues in its distribution centres, who are mostly men. Following the ruling Tesco said: \"These claims are extremely complex and will take many years to reach a conclusion. We continue to strongly defend these claims.\" Lawyers say the litigation could run on for years. ",

            "content": "Scotland and England have lifted their guidance to work from home. However, people in Northern Ireland and Wales are still advised to work remotely where possible. In England the government is no longer asking people to work from home. It had previously asked people to do so, to help tackle the spread of Omicron. In Scotland, similar guidance has now been relaxed. The government wants firms to let workers return gradually - allowing them to spend some time in the office and some time at home. In Northern Ireland, current guidance is to work from home where you can. Offices no longer need to take reasonable measures for 2m (6ft) social distancing, although risk assessments should still be carried out. In Wales, the government says it remains important to work from home if you can. A legal restriction to work from home unless unavoidable - with £60 fines for anyone who did not comply - has been scrapped. Employers are asked to follow official safety guidance and carry out Covid risk assessments for those staff who are in the office. Safety measures can include: improving ventilation\nadditional cleaning\nturning away people with Covid There is more detailed advice for some industries - including construction, hospitality and manufacturing, plus specific advice for employers in England, Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland. Face-coverings remain mandatory for staff and customers in shops and on public transport across the UK, apart from England. Northern Ireland, Wales and Scotland have Covid passport schemes which are partly designed to protect staff who work in hospitality and events. If employees feel unsafe, they can raise concerns with their local authority, Citizens Advice or the Health and Safety Executive (HSE). Working from home is one of the most effective ways to reduce exposure to Covid, according to the government's Scientific Advisory Group for Emergencies (Sage). It greatly limits face-to-face contact - both with colleagues and on public transport. Much of the risk depends on how crowded it is and your distance from other people. Wearing a mask helps, as does keeping windows open, and avoiding peak journey times where possible. In 2020, 37% of working UK adults did at least some work from home, up from 27% the previous year.

            "content": "Police in Macau have arrested a leading casino boss amid a crackdown in the world's biggest gambling hub. On Sunday, authorities said they had arrested two men over alleged money laundering and illegal gambling. Macau Legend Development, which runs three casinos in the city, confirmed the arrest of its chief executive and controlling shareholder Chan Weng Lin. The move comes after the arrest in November of high profile Macau gambling executive Alvin Chau. Gambling is illegal in mainland China but is allowed in Macau, which like Hong Kong is a special administrative region of China. \"The Board is of the view that as the Group is operated by a team of management personnel and the above incident relates to the personal affairs of Mr Chan and not related to the Group,\" Macau Legend Development said in a statement to the Hong Kong Stock Exchange. \"The Board does not expect the above incident to have a material adverse impact on the daily operations of the Group,\" it added. Macau casino shares fall after weekend arrests\nCrackdown fears put Macau casinos on losing streak The company runs the Landmark Macau, Babylon Casino and Legend Palace Casino in Macau. Shares in Macau Legend Development plunged by as much as 30% in Hong Kong on Monday. Mr Chan is also the chairman of Tak Chun Group, which organises \"junkets\", or trips to casinos for wealthy gamblers. Tak Chun did not immediately respond to a request for comment from the BBC. In November, Alvin Chau, the chairman of Macau's biggest junket operator Suncity, was arrested as authorities cracked down on alleged money laundering and illegal cross-border gambling. Macau's Gaming Inspection and Coordination Bureau, which regulates the city's gambling industry, met with police this month with the aim of strengthening their collaboration on gambling-related crimes. The regulator said it would pay close attention to what happens in and outside casinos, which are expected to see an increase in visitors during February's Lunar New Year festival. ",

            "header": "National Insurance: Rise will squeeze budgets - CBI",
            "content": "A planned rise in National Insurance from April will \"unquestionably place a further squeeze\" on budgets and risk stunting economic growth, the CBI business group has warned. The CBI said firms \"weren't supportive\" of the tax increase when it was first announced, and \"they're still not\". The Federation of Small Businesses (FSB) said the rise could \"spell the end for a lot of small firms\". The government has said the increase will help clear the NHS backlog. Prime Minister Boris Johnson and Chancellor Rishi Sunak wrote in the Sunday Times to confirm the £12bn rise, which they said was \"the right plan\" and \"must go ahead\". Why are prices rising so quickly?\nWhat will National Insurance changes cost me? Under the government's plans, employees, employers and the self-employed will all pay 1.25p more in the pound for National Insurance from April 2022 for a year. After that, the extra tax will be collected as a new Health and Social Care Levy. The changes will see an employee on £20,000 a year pay an extra £89 in tax, while someone on £50,000 will pay £464 more. Critics have said the increase could contribute to inflation - the rate at which prices rise - which is already at its highest point for three decades, reaching 5.4% in January. There are also concerns the rise could contribute to the cost of living, with household budgets being squeezed by rising energy prices. But the NHS Confederation, the body which represents health and care leaders, has said the funding is needed to care for vulnerable people. The CBI, which represents 190,000 UK businesses, said increasing National Insurance would \"risk curtailing growth at a critical moment in the recovery\" from coronavirus restrictions. A spokesperson said businesses recognised the \"need to fund the increased demands on our health and social care service\", but urged the government to look to other methods of raising funds it could. \"If the government goes ahead as planned, then it is incumbent on them to use the March Budget to bring forward more ambitious plans to raise the longer term growth potential of the economy,\" the CBI added. For Lucy Bull, who manages Castle Grove Nursing Home in Devon, the rise in National Insurance will come at a time she wants to increase wages for her 45 carers. She told the BBC she believed the extra tax revenue would mostly go to the NHS, and not reach the care sector. She added while the NHS had done a \"brilliant job\" through the pandemic, the funding needed to be for the \"care sector as a whole\". \"We are working really hard to raise the salaries for our care workers - taxing even more is not going to help that,\" she said. \"The cost of personal care, it's extremely expensive and it's just going up.\" Ms Bull, who is also a director at Devon Care Homes Collaborative, said unlike other businesses, the care sector couldn't just decide to charge more money for beds. \"It's not just the same as deciding you're going to charge a bit more for a cup of coffee,\" she added. \"For most relatives and residents there's a finite pot of money.\" Elsewhere, the boss of the Federation of Small Businesses, said its members had warned they would have \"no choice but to increase prices, reduce wages or let staff go\", if the government proceeded as planned, due to other increases in the National Living Wage and business rates. National chairman Mike Cherry said: \"This regressive tax hike will hit lower earners and struggling community small businesses the hardest, leaving less cash in people's pockets to spur our recovery.\" Mr Cherry also warned National Insurance rising would coincide with the moment reliefs on business rates were due to end, which he said would \"spell the end for a lot of small firms\", unless \"action is taken now\". UK Hospitality boss Kate Nicholls tweeted restaurants, bars and pubs also had to deal with business rates relief ending, on top of rising VAT and supply chain problems. \"All when consumers will already feel pinch and demand will be suppressed. Keep VAT at 12.5% will ease price pressure,\" she said. Meanwhile, Matthew Taylor, chief executive of the NHS Confederation, said without the extra funding, the public would face longer waits for treatment and \"hundreds of thousands of vulnerable people won't get the care and support they need from social care services\". \"But it is for the government to decide how best to fund this extra investment,\" he added. Sarah McClinton, vice-president of Association of Directors of Adult Social Services, said it was \"essential that as a society we fund adult social care in the longer term\", adding more tax needed to be assigned to social care.

            "header": "Cost of living: Will parents spend less on kids' toys?",
            "content": "Ria Painter-Coates was once a technical illustrator, drawing the assembly instructions for flat-pack furniture. Now, her talents are put to better use designing unusual animal cards and colouring books for children. Her card games and unexpected facts about the natural world are a lot more fun than a visual guide to building a wardrobe. But this home-schooling mother-of-two understands that even toys can bring frustration for parents, not least owing to the cost. So she tries to sell her products for no more than £15. \"When you home educate your kids, you have to buy your own resources,\" she says. \"I did not want these to be too expensive for any parents.\" Her business - called Button and Squirt after her children's nicknames - is a one-woman operation. She draws all the animals featured on the cards, and researches the facts that accompany them. These are not your typical household pets. Flicking through a pack of cards at London's Toy Fair trade show, she picks out the cockeyed squid, and the panda ant - which is neither a panda nor an ant, but actually a species of wasp found in South America. The sting in the tail for Mrs Painter-Coates has been getting such a business off the ground during a pandemic, it's been tough. Now, even though shops are open again, there is the subsequent challenge of a cost of living crisis facing her customers. By keeping her prices low, she hopes to overcome that too. Evidence shows that even during times of economic turmoil in the past, the toy sector has come through relatively unscathed in terms of sales. Parents and grandparents will reduce their spending on lots of other things before cutting back on birthday or Christmas presents for their youngsters. The universal squeeze on household budgets caused primarily by rising energy bills is likely to put that theory to the test this year, given that UK toy sales have already recorded a 3% year-on-year drop. So far, parents have been more concerned about product quality than affordability, according to data from The Insights Family, which conducts regular surveys of children and parents. Nazneen Yasin, founder of Fabula Toys, which makes inclusive pre-school products based on nursery rhymes, says: \"Most parents are looking for a good reason to buy, not just something colourful and bright that will just go to the back of a toy box after a week.\" Children tend to want to open a lot of smaller presents, data from The Insights Family show, even though bicycles and games consoles are high up on kids' wish lists. A stroll around the numerous stands at the Toy Fair in London's Olympia suggests toymakers are keen to land successes with big-ticket, relatively high cost items. Of the 23 \"hero toys\" selected by the show's organisers - the British Toy and Hobby Association - only one had a retail price of less than £14.99. Yet, when asked which items on his display were the most popular, Toy Fair exhibitor Jon Sumner points to a £1.99 erasable pen. Mr Sumner, from Pen Paper Gift Limited - a small business with three full-time members of staff, says it will be interesting to see whether lower-priced items benefit when the cost of household bills really starts to bite. Smaller, impulse buys dropped at the height of the pandemic when shops were closed but were rising again by the end of 2021, according to The Insights Family's data. Among those to benefit are Panini - the sticker collection company - which had a bumper summer thanks to the men's England football team's run to the final of the Euro championships. A packet of stickers costs 70p and, being sold in supermarkets and newsagents, are often bought on a parental whim. \"They are the most inexpensive memorabilia if a home nation does well in a major tournament,\" says Lewi Hillier, sales director at Click Distribution, which has an exclusive distribution deal with Panini. Of course, low-cost items are not necessarily more affordable if you end up buying a lot of them, and he says that many collectors - including adults - choose bulk purchases to keep the price of completing a whole album down. With the next men's football World Cup coming next winter, some of those albums may well go unfinished as parents save hard for Christmas instead, at a time when family finances will be under significant pressure.

            "content": "There could be as many as a million missing workers in the UK job market, experts say. Latest figures suggest that the vast majority of livelihoods survived the end of the furlough scheme, designed to protect the economy from the ravages of Covid. Fears of a huge spike in unemployment when the support was withdrawn have failed to materialise. On the contrary: with vacancies at a record high of 1.2 million, many employers are struggling to cope with a shortage of skilled workers. On Thursday, the government announced plans to get 500,000 jobseekers into jobs by the end of June, with those claiming Universal Credit having to look for jobs outside their chosen field more quickly or face sanctions. £150,000 starting salaries as firms fight for staff\nPay rises fail to keep up with the cost of living According to the director of the Institute for Employment Studies, Tony Wilson, the problem is that the pandemic has caused the UK labour market to shrink. \"We're seeing unemployment falling, but we're also seeing employment quite a lot lower than it was before the crisis began,\" he told the BBC. Well, since the onset of coronavirus, there has been a big rise in the number of people classed as \"economically inactive\" - that is, people who are not looking for jobs and are not available for work. The Office for National Statistics (ONS) reckons that there are 400,000 more people in that category than there were before the virus hit. Darren Morgan, director of economic statistics at the ONS, says that total \"increased sharply\" at the beginning of the pandemic, a rise he describes as \"understandable\". \"If you lost your job then, there was little point in looking for one, given the economy was closed,\" he told the BBC. But since then, the number of economically inactive people has proved \"far stickier\" than the number of people out of work, he adds. \"We have not seen falls like we've seen in unemployment, and this is particularly the case for those over 50,\" he said. That, of course, includes some people who have chosen to take early retirement, although others may feel the choice has been made for them. Recent research by the Resolution Foundation think-tank also suggests that fewer young men are now economically active, perhaps due to fear of illness or suffering with long Covid, while more women have taken up roles due to the rise in flexible working. Tony Wilson of the IES says students are also a factor. \"A lot of young people decided to stay in education instead of entering the labour market a year ago,\" he said. \"But actually, more recently it's been growing because of longer-term ill-health\" - a problem that includes people suffering from the after-effects of the virus known as \"long Covid\". \"All told, we think because the labour market was growing pretty consistently over the last few decades, the fact that it's now gone into reverse means that this gap, this half a million gap in employment, is even larger when you account for the growth in the labour market that we were seeing,\" Mr Wilson says. \"We think there's a gap of about a million people between what the labour market would have been like without Covid and where it is now.\" Many of the labour shortages in particular sectors have been attributed to a decline in the number of foreign workers in the UK. Because of a combination of Covid and Brexit, many EU nationals who worked in the UK have returned to their countries of origin. Mr Wilson of the IES believes that the lack of migrant workers is responsible for the one-third of the shortfall in the labour market, while the rise in economic inactivity accounts for the other two-thirds. Kate Shoesmith, deputy chief executive of the Recruitment and Employment Confederation (REC), says the run-up to Christmas was \"a touch-and-go moment\" for many businesses, with Covid and recruitment problems coming together. \"It was a combination of the lowest candidate availability we've ever known and absence rates creeping up,\" she told the BBC. Now Covid sickness rates are settling down, but shortages are still \"a big sticking point\", she says. She singles out healthcare as one of the worst-affected sectors currently, with the NHS and private providers trying to woo a limited pool of skilled workers amid high demand for services. \"Sometimes the NHS will be paying more to retain staff, because the NHS and the private sector are competing on wages,\" she says. Elsewhere in the economy, efforts to address the chronic shortage of lorry drivers have borne fruit, but at the price of attracting people from other sectors, such as fork-lift truck drivers or warehouse workers, she says. \"You have to look at the supply chain as a whole. There's a sense that we're robbing Peter to pay Paul.\" And the beleaguered hospitality sector is under renewed pressure to raise wages, while not having had the chance to replenish cash reserves over the festive season because of Plan B Covid restrictions, she adds. Ms Shoesmith says the answer lies in persuading the economically inactive to return to the job market. But doing it properly, she says, will require a joint effort between the public and private sectors. Jobcentres and recruitment agencies \"working hand in hand\" could rebuild the confidence of people who have dropped out of the job market and help them back into work, she adds. \"After the 2007-08 crash, there was a shared sense of purpose, a combined effort,\" Ms Shoesmith says. \"Jobcentres can get people in, while recruiters can offer deep understanding of a sector,\" she says. \"We've done it before and we can do it again.\" ",

Cambridge-based Autonomy was sold to the US tech giant for $11bn in 2011. HP sued its founder and former chief financial officer, claiming they \"artificially inflated Autonomy's reported revenues, revenue growth and gross margins\". Mr Justice Hildyard said HP had \"substantially won\" its case. 'UK extradition treaty doesn't rely on any facts'\nAutonomy ex-finance boss sentenced to jail\nAutonomy boss in 'deliberate fraud' His conclusions, read out at the High Court in London, come more than two years after the start of what was believed to be the UK's biggest civil fraud trial, which was heard over nine months in 2019. The judge said the amount of damages to be paid would be dealt with at a later date. He has circulated his full ruling on the civil claim by HP to the parties and their legal teams, but it has not yet been published and remains strictly under embargo. Home Secretary Priti Patel is also due to make a decision about whether Autonomy founder and entrepreneur Mike Lynch should be extradited to the US, where he faces fraud charges in a separate criminal case. US authorities claim Dr Lynch, who denies all charges against him, deliberately overstated the value of his business, which specialised in software to sort through large data sets. On Wednesday, Ms Patel was given until midnight on Friday to decide on his extradition, after a High Court judge ruled against Dr Lynch's legal challenge over a previously set deadline. Ms Patel had wanted to consider Mr Justice Hildyard's ruling on the High Court civil claim before making an extradition decision. Dr Lynch, from Suffolk, argued the technology giant was trying to make him \"a scapegoat for their failures\". His former chief financial officer Sushovan Hussain was convicted in April 2018 in the US of wire fraud and other crimes related to Autonomy's sale and was jailed for five years. In the separate criminal proceedings in the US, Dr Lynch faces charges of securities fraud, wire fraud and conspiracy in a federal court over the sale of Autonomy. Dr Lynch's lawyer, Kelwin Nicholls of Clifford Chance, said his client intends to appeal and called the outcome of the hearing \"disappointing\". He said: \"We note the judge's concerns over the reliability of some of HP's witnesses. \"We also note the judge's expectation that any loss suffered by HP will be substantially less than the $5bn claimed.\" Find BBC News: East of England on Facebook, Instagram and Twitter.

Ms Blanc, who is also the government's Champion for Women in Finance, said she wanted her 20,000-strong staff to be in the office about three days a week, but added there would be \"big flexibility around that\". \"I am really keen that we do have some physically presence in the office even though I think the way we work in the office will be different than how it was pre Covid,\" she said. \"I don't want that to happen.\" Working from home boosts career, say half of women\nWorkers who want flexible work roles missing out\nCovid 'could set women's equality back 25 years' Ms Blanc said the progression of women in the financial services sector was \"just simply not good enough\" as they were \"not moving into more senior roles quickly enough\". \"It's my role as the government's women and finance champion, but also as a woman leading an organisation, to make sure we create the right environment for everyone to flourish and for women to be given the same opportunity as men,\" she said. \"We just need to make sure that in the way that we work we don't jeopardise women's opportunities.\" Previous research from the Institute of Fiscal Studies (IFS) has suggested even when mothers were the primary earners before the coronavirus pandemic, their paid work was still interrupted more than that of their lower-earning partners in order to meet additional childcare demands. Researchers also found mothers did more housework and childcare irrespective of their pre-lockdown relative pay. Lower-paid mothers did double the amount of housework and 41% more childcare than higher-paid fathers, while higher-paid mothers did 6% more housework and 22% more childcare than lower-paid fathers. Meanwhile, global data from UN Women has suggested women were doing significantly more domestic chores and family care, because of the impact the pandemic, which it has warned could wipe out 25 years of increasing gender equality. Ms Blanc said she believed the \"changing back and forth\" in work-from-home guidance throughout the pandemic had made it \"difficult\" for staff to plan their lives around how they work. \"It's been like the Hokey Cokey hasn't it? We're sort of in and we're out,\" she said. The Aviva boss is not the first in the finance sector to raise concerns about women's career progress being affected by workers returning to the office. Bank of England economist Catherine Mann previously told the BBC there was a risk women who were working mostly from home could see their careers stall. She said it was a particular issue for mothers facing school disruptions and difficulty accessing childcare. ",

            "content": "The US economy expanded at its fastest rate in decades last year as it roared back from pandemic lockdowns. Official figures from the Commerce Department showed the economy grew by 5.7% - its best performance since 1984. But analysts are expecting growth to slow this year, as the government scales back stimulus spending and the Federal Reserve raises interest rates. Other risks include high inflation and threats from new Covid variants, such as Omicron. The World Bank is predicting the US economy will grow by 3.7% this year, in line with other forecasts. \"The Omicron wave means the economy is starting 2022 on a much weaker footing and we expect growth to disappoint over the rest of this year too,\" said Andrew Hunter, senior US economist at Capital Economics. Consumer spending and government stimulus helped power the rebound from 2020, when gross domestic product contracted by 3.4% as the pandemic struck. US central bank says rate rise 'appropriate' soon\nGlobal economy faces grim outlook, says World Bank The labour market has now regained some 19 million of the 22 million jobs lost amid shutdowns that year. Output remained robust in the final three months of the year, when it grew at a better-than-expected annual rate of 6.9%. President Joe Biden hailed the figures, saying they were \"no accident\" but rather driven by the government's recovery efforts. As pandemic stimulus winds down, he urged Congress to move forward with additional spending plans focused on areas such as renewable energy, manufacturing and child care. But with Mr Biden's agenda currently stalled in Congress, the economy is likely to have to perform without that boost - and with less help from America's central bank. On Wednesday, Federal Reserve chair Jerome Powell signalled officials were planning to raise its key interest rate in March for the first time since 2018, saying the economy no longer needed extra-low borrowing costs put in place in 2020 to help it along. \"The defining challenge for the economy in the next year or two will be how well we can sustain growth not just in the absence of fiscal policy, but in the face of tightening monetary policy,\" Wells Fargo economists wrote in a research note. The Fed is under pressure to tackle inflation as the US sees prices rise at their fastest rate in nearly 40 years. Bank officials had initially said the pressures would be transitory and fade as the world moved past supply chain problems triggered by the virus - something that has proved to be far more difficult than hoped. Some analysts say the Fed has already moved too slowly to respond to the issue, while others fear the bank will move too aggressively, and the higher borrowing costs will reduce demand by more than expected. US stock markets have seen three consecutive weeks of declines amid the concerns, as well as more recent data suggesting a slowdown as Omicron hit at the end of December and January. \"Today's figures measure GDP up until the end of December 2021, excluding some of the recent surges in Covid-19 cases,\" said Richard Flynn, managing director at Charles Schwab UK. \"Indeed, there's been weakness across US stock indices in the first weeks of 2022, as investors digest some of the risks facing the economy: receding monetary and fiscal liquidity, persistent effects from the pandemic, and a rise in inflationary pressures.\" ",

            "content": "Farmers are being \"cold called\" by agents working for investors who want to buy farmland to plant trees that would offset their carbon footprint. Farming unions claim \"powerful players are seeking to offset emissions\" at the expense of rural communities in what one politician called a \"land grab\". Land agent Savills said it has made \"direct approaches\" to farmers in Wales on behalf of clients. One of those approached said they feared farmers were an \"easy take\". Kyra Somerfield said she was \"annoyed\" and \"shocked\" by the unsolicited call from Savills to ask if she was interested in selling the 220-acre family farm in Carmarthenshire where she has lived and worked for 60 years. The 83-year-old is worried the nature of Wales could change forever if productive farm land is converted to forests. \"If we do go along those lines of covering our uplands with trees, the nature of Wales would change irrevocably,\" said Mrs Somerfield. What is greenwashing and how can you spot it?\nSeven ways not to be fooled by greenwashing tricks\nCarbon offsetting 'not get-out-of-jail-free card' \"Once land goes from productive agriculture into forestry, it will never return. The potential would be an upland clearance of Wales.\" The Welsh government, which declared a climate emergency in 2019, has said it needs to plant 86 million trees by the end of this decade to meet its net zero target by 2050. But farming unions say people and companies should reduce their own carbon emissions rather than \"offset our way to net zero\". Over the past three years, the Farmers' Union of Wales (FUW) says 75% of the biggest plans for planting trees on Welsh land came from outside the country. Any proposal to plant over 50 hectares of woodland in Wales - the size of about 93 football fields - needs an environmental impact assessment, but the FUW says only 25% of those plans came from land owners based in Wales. The situation has angered Mrs Somerfield, who said: \"It's the element of being taken for granted, that I could easily accept this type of offer. \"It's probably cutting my nose to spite my face in a way, because I'm sure a lot of people will make money by such sales. But I'm not prepared to do so. \"They may be able to dispose of land that is too hard to farm, because on the whole the number of people engaged in hill farming are getting older, they're getting fewer - and the demands of agriculture today are becoming greater.\" Mrs Somerfield hopes her 16-year-old grandson Lewis can continue her farming legacy and take over Cruglas farm near Llandeilo, where she rears 300 sheep and 30 beef cattle. \"They'd be taking away everything that my grandparents started,\" said Lewis, who is currently studying agricultural engineering at nearby Gelli Aur College. \"They're willing to pay more than the land's worth, just so that they can get the land, which leaves the farmers with no option really. \"Everyone's struggling and wanting more money so if somebody comes along and says we'll take your issues away and here's some money, most people would do it.\" Savills confirmed they are making \"direct approaches\" on behalf of \"investors\" adding that the land had \"already been screened for its suitability\" to plant trees. The head of forestry for Savills said \"investors have an important role to play in the delivery\" of the Welsh government's tree-planting ambitions. \"The increasing importance of environmental governance has widened interest in acquiring land to create new woodlands,\" added James Adamson. \"The land market is small and the amount of land that comes to the open market that may be suitable for tree planting is only a small proportion of the overall potential land area. \"In order to accelerate the rate of potential tree planting we are making direct approaches to owners of land that may be suitable rather than wait for land to come to market.\" Plaid Cymru's Welsh Parliament member Mabon ap Gwynfor has called it a \"land grab\" of Welsh farmland. Could Welsh farms help hit climate change targets?\nFive ways farmers are tackling climate change\nHow will Wales go green by 2050? \"This is nothing more than greenwashing in order to ease the climate conscience of large corporations and effectively allow them to continue with their dirty industries,\" said the Dwyfor Meirionnydd MS. The FUW said while it supports \"enhancing and expanding woodland within farmland\", it added it is \"concerning that outside investors are directly targeting Welsh farmland to purchase for tree planting and presumably capitalise on the carbon market\". \"Displacing existing ownership and family farms will be detrimental to the wider rural economy and community, Welsh culture and food security,\" the FUW said in a statement. \"A balance must be struck that ensures vulnerable landscapes, communities and industries do not suffer as powerful players seek to offset their emissions, as opposed to reducing them in the first instance. We cannot offset our way to net zero.\" The Welsh government said it wants to \"create a Wales that is resilient to climate change\" and has set up working group to help farmers to \"be at the heart of woodland creation\". \"Most recipients of funding so far have been farmers, or woodland management experts,\" said a government spokesperson. \"We see farmers and applicants as the stewards of our countryside in Wales, and consider them all essential in helping us realise our ambitious plans to create a national forest that both we and our future generations can benefit from.\" BARGE BASHING AND BICKERING: Explore Welsh canals with Maureen and Gareth\nDIG OUT YOUR CAGOULE AND TIE UP THOSE BOOTS: The Welsh Coast awaits, explore it with Derek ",

            "header": "Car production falls to lowest level for 65 years",
            "content": "Car production in the UK last year fell to its lowest level since 1956, according to figures from the Society of Motor Manufacturers and Traders. The SMMT said the figures were dismal, largely thanks to a global microchip shortage and disruption caused by the coronavirus pandemic. It said there was optimism for the future, with the announcement of new investment worth nearly £5bn. But it warned high energy costs could be a challenge for carmakers this year. Hopes that car production would recover in 2021 were firmly dashed. According to the SMMT's figures, just under 860,000 new cars left UK factories last year. That was even fewer than in 2020, when the first wave of Covid and the associated lockdowns forced several factories to close. Production last year was 6.7% lower than in 2020 - and a full 34% below its pre-pandemic level. The main reason for the decline, the SMMT said, was a severe shortage of semiconductors, or computer chips. A modern car has complex electronics and can use between 1,500 and 3,000 chips to operate items such as engine management systems, emissions controls, safety devices and navigation systems. But there were other factors affecting production too. These included widespread staff absences as workers were forced to go into isolation, and the impact of the closure of Honda's factory in Swindon. The SMMT's chief executive Mike Hawes admitted it had been \"a dismal year, there's no hiding it\". But he suggested that \"despite this miserable year there is optimism\", largely because of the announcement of £4.9bn in planned new investments, many of them in electric vehicles or technology. These, he said, had been triggered by the signing of a Brexit deal with the EU, which had provided \"a real shot in the arm\", following five years of declining investment. But he added the UK was \"still playing catch-up\" after a long period of Brexit-related uncertainty. \"The industry did everything it could to be prepared [for new post-Brexit trading arrangements], and largely that has been relatively smooth,\" he told the BBC's Today programme. \"It has incurred additional costs though, because whilst we were able to benefit from the deal we have with the EU, which avoids tariffs, it doesn't avoid other tariff barriers and additional administration which has required additional people and additional costs to everyone, whether you're exporting or importing.\" For the UK motor industry, the pandemic came at just the wrong time. Car production was already falling, and Brexit uncertainty was making manufacturers reluctant to invest in Britain - at a time when they were making big plans for a new generation of electric vehicles. The trade deal with the EU solved that problem - but it came in the middle of a Covid outbreak which triggered a wave of new issues. The shortage of computer chips is global and manufacturers around the world have been struggling to deal with it. But at a time when the UK car industry should have been focusing on making up lost ground, it was left managing a crisis. The past year has been truly miserable for the sector. Nevertheless, new investment is now coming in, and that momentum now has to be sustained if the UK is truly to become a force in the new market for electric vehicles. Despite the general malaise in the industry, meanwhile, production of electric and hybrid cars rose by nearly 30% - and accounted for nearly a quarter of all the cars built. Van production, which is becoming an increasingly important part of the UK motor industry, was also strong, with output recovering to just 3% below its pre-pandemic level. Demand for these vehicles has been soaring due to the popularity of online shopping and home deliveries. Independent forecasts produced for the SMMT suggest that production will rise by nearly 20% next year, to more than one million vehicles. But the organisation said that unless new players come into the market, the industry is unlikely to return to the output levels seen five years ago, when some 1.7 million cars left UK factories. That is due to the closure of Honda's Swindon plant, and the decision to make vans instead of cars at Vauxhall's factory in Ellesmere Port. The chip shortage, meanwhile, is expected to remain a factor in the first part of this year - but become easier after that. However, the industry is likely to face another, very significant challenge: rapidly rising energy costs. \"Escalating energy costs threaten the viability of vehicle plants, but also our competitive position,\" Mr Hawes said. \"We already pay more in energy costs here in the UK than in competitor countries across Europe and beyond. \"So we need to make sure we can try and mitigate those price rises to ensure we can remain competitive.\" ",

            "content": "Proposals for a quarry on the site of the former Hatfield Aerodrome have been dismissed on appeal. Hertfordshire County Council had rejected Brett Aggregates' plans to extract up to eight million tonnes of sand and gravel from the site between Smallford and Ellenbrook. The Planning Inspectorate said harm to the green belt was \"not outweighed by the benefits\" of extracted minerals. Brett Aggregates said it was \"disappointed\" with the appeal outcome. Hatfield Aerodrome was a private airfield linked to the de Havilland Aircraft Company factory from 1930. It was acquired by Hawker Siddeley from 1960 and latterly British Aerospace in 1978. The site was redeveloped in the 1990s with offices, businesses and homes covering part of the site. The rest is grassland known as Ellenbrook Fields which is popular with walkers and cyclists. Brett Aggregates' planning application included new access to the A1057, an aggregate processing plant, a concrete batching plant and other \"supporting facilities\" for a period of 32 years, the Local Democracy Reporting Service said. Following a nine-day planning inquiry in November, planning inspector John Woolcock published his decision on Tuesday, dismissing the appeal and determining that the plans should not be allowed to go ahead. While Mr Woolcock highlighted the \"important contribution\" the quarry would make to the county's need for sand and gravel, he said that as well as damaging the green belt, the plans would cause \"harm to the character, appearance and amenity of the area\" and pedestrian safety. He added that noise could have \"a significant adverse effect\" on those living nearby and that even with \"progressive restoration\", the development would have an adverse long-term effect on the character of the area. It \"had not been demonstrated that the development could be made acceptable through the use of conditions or planning obligations\", he said. Mr Woolcock particularly highlighted the inclusion of a \"concrete batching plant\", which it was said \"plays no direct role in the winning and working of minerals\". In September, Brett Aggregates submitted revised proposals which included a number of changes including the omission of this plant. At the inquiry hearing, the company asked whether the inspector could consider the changes contained in the amended scheme. But Mr Woolcock ruled that the plans initially determined by the county council should be the subject of the appeal decision, because the changed development should be a subject for consultation. A spokesman for Brett Aggregates said: \"We are disappointed about the outcome of our appeal and we are working to understand fully the reasons why it has been dismissed before considering our options.\" Find BBC News: East of England on Facebook, Instagram and Twitter.

It aims to produce its first electric car within the next three years, with exclusively electric models by 2030. The new models will be developed at the company's plant in Crewe, Cheshire, which will also see investment to become carbon neutral, the firm said. Bentley's CEO Adrian Hallmark said the plans were bold and ambitious and a \"milestone moment\" for the brand. \"Our aim is to become the benchmark not just for luxury cars or sustainable credentials but the entire scope of our operations,\" he said. \"Securing production of our first BEV [battery-powered electric vehicle] in Crewe is a milestone moment for Bentley, and the UK, as we plan for a long-term sustainable future in Crewe.\" Sales of new cars and vans powered wholly by petrol and diesel are set to be banned in the UK from 2030.

            "content": "Plant-milk brand Oatly has been told not to repeat some of its adverts, after complaints to the Advertising Standards Authority (ASA) were upheld. The ads, which used the slogan \"Need help talking to dad about milk?\", made unsubstantiated environmental claims, the ASA found. First published in January 2021, the ads compared the carbon footprint of Oatly's milk with dairy milk. They also compared vegan to omnivorous diets in general. But, following 109 separate complaints, the firm failed to provide the evidence to back up many of its claims, the ASA found. \"It's clear that we could have been more specific in the way we described some of the scientific data,\" Oatly spokesman Tim Knight said. \"We're a science-based company and take pride in being precise, but we could have been clearer.\" The ASA has made clear it will take a tougher stance on firms making environmental statements. The regulating body said last year it would be scrutinising such claims closely and has already ruled against a Lipton tea ad which claimed its plastic bottles were \"100% recycled plastic\" while the small print explained that did not include the lid or label. Advertising regulator to target greenwashing ads\nWhat's your diet's carbon footprint?\nThe people moving from high to low-carbon careers The Oatly television advertisements which attracted viewer complaints featured a man sneaking into his home and putting a bottle of traditional milk in the fridge. He was interrupted by his son who questioned his choice of milk. Text on screen stated that \"Oatly generates 73% less CO2e vs. milk, calculated from grower to grocer\". But the ASA said the ad was misleading because Oatly based the claim on comparing one of its products, Oatly Barista Edition, with full cream milk. The ASA said consumers would understand the claim to include all of Oatly's products. A related social media-based ad campaign included the text: \"The dairy and meat industries emit more CO2e than all the world's planes, trains, cars, boats etc., combined\". The ASA said Oatly had not compared like for like. It compared the full lifecycle of the meat and dairy industry including emissions from producing feed, using fertilisers, and transporting the food, with figures from the transport industry which only reflected emissions coming directly from the vehicles. Oatly was founded in the 1990s, and has grown rapidly on the back of the expanding market for dairy alternatives. The Swedish brand is now sold in 20 countries. Last year it attracted investment from Oprah Winfrey, Jay-Z and private equity group Blackstone, before floating on the US stock market. The firm targets younger consumers with advertising that is overtly pro-vegan, appealing to their sense of virtue around dietary choices and climate change, while gently mocking older consumers for being resistant to change. In two newspaper ads Oatly said: \"Today, more than 25% of the world's greenhouse gases are generated by the food industry, and meat and dairy account for more than half of that\". The ASA said this ad was misleading because Oatly had held meat and dairy to include fish and eggs, whereas consumers might assume it referred to a narrower definition. A further claim, that \"Climate experts say cutting dairy and meat products from our diets is the single biggest lifestyle change we can make to reduce our environmental impact\" also overstated the evidence, the ASA said. While Oatly identified Joseph Poore, the author of what the ASA described as \"good quality\" meta-analysis in this area, consumers would have assumed that the ad referred to a scientific consensus involving several experts, the ASA said. However the ASA did not uphold complaints against a further claim that \"If everyone in the world adopted a vegan diet, it would reduce food's annual greenhouse emissions by 6.6bn metric tons (a 49% reduction)\", which the advertising regulator said was substantiated by Mr Poore's analysis and by a report from the Institute for Climate Economics.

            "content": "The growth in pet ownership during the Covid pandemic has continued with retailer Pets at Home forecasting record sales and profits. The company said it had a \"record Christmas\" with strong growth in sales across its 445 UK stores and its 300 vet and grooming outlets. It said sales in the third quarter were up 8.7% on 2020 and 28.1% on 2019. Boss Peter Pritchard said despite the rise in the cost of living, people were unlikely to cut back on pet spending. \"I think history actually tells us one of the very last things customers do is cut back on their pets, they are much more likely to cut back on a holiday or a big discretionary purchase,\" he told the BBC's Today Programme. \"Pets are very much part of the family. We expect given the fact there are more pets in the country than ever before we expect revenue to be and continue to be very strong this year.\" In its trading statement, Pets at Home said it was experiencing \"a number of inflationary pressures\" across its supply chain, and planned to mitigate them by seeking rent reductions at its shops and \"operational efficiencies\" across its business. Mr Pritchard said he recognised customers were \"under pressure\". \"We want to keep pet ownership really affordable for our customers,\" he added. He said the firm was on track to report \"a record year of sales and profit growth\", adding the company had served more pet owners than \"ever before\" in the 12-week period from 8 October to 30 December 2021. \"In the month of December alone we actually also groomed 90,000 dogs, 5,500 dogs on Christmas Eve alone, so it was a very busy Christmas for us,\" said Mr Pritchard. Pets at Home sells pet products and some small animals and fish. Pets prove 'a lifesaver' for lockdown loneliness It also provides grooming and veterinary services for cats and dogs, and people can subscribe to its Puppy & Kitten Club which offers discounts. Mr Pritchard confirmed the lockdown-induced craze for buying pets showed no signs of abating, with the company's retail arm welcoming 25,000 new customers a week and more than 9,000 new client registrations for its vet business. \"There a more pet owners than ever before,\" he said. In March 2021, the Pet Food Manufactures' Association said a total of 3.2 million households in the UK had bought a new pet since the start of the pandemic. Matt Britzman, equity analyst at Hargreaves Lansdown, said there was a continuing trend of \"pet humanisation\", with owners \"passing their own health and food principles on to their pets - even going as far as having their own social media following\". \"That's more opportunity for those in the business of servicing - it's often the more premium brands that cater for these specific needs, giving a welcomed leg up to sales and margins,\" he said. \"UK pet ownership shows little signs of slowing down as working from home becomes ever more popular and households favour locations that offer more space,\" he added.

            "content": "Care home staff and nurses are among key workers facing the prospect of being paid less this year than last, according to the Trades Union Congress. Pay increases are failing to keep up with rising inflation, leading to another year of \"wages gloom\" for public sector workers, the TUC said. That could be a \"hammer blow to morale\" prompting staff to quit, it said. The Treasury said that public sector wages would be going up for the next three years. The TUC is calling on the government to ensure public sector workers receive a \"decent\" pay rise. The union umbrella body said public sector workers were already thousands of pounds worse off after suffering a \"lost decade\", during which their pay failed to keep up with price rises. With inflation now forecast to reach 6% or higher in 2022, the situation was set to get worse, it said. Surging food prices push inflation to 30-year high\nInflation surge sends UK interest payments higher Frances O'Grady, the TUC general secretary, said: \"Hard work should pay for everyone. \"But millions of key workers - on the frontline of the pandemic - face another year of wages gloom. That is not right. \"The government must stop burying its head and get pay rising across the economy. Ministers cannot abandon families during this cost-of-living crisis.\" In real terms - that is, after inflation is taken into account - nurses are £2,700 worse off than in 2010, the TUC has calculated. Care workers employed by local authorities are more than £1,600 a year worse off, it added. The TUC said excessive workloads and a lack of recognition, as well as stagnating wages, was causing a staffing crisis in the NHS and other public services, prompting staff to quit. The body called on the government to prioritise key worker pay in 2022 by easing restrictions on pay policy and providing more funding to government departments. A Treasury spokesperson said: \"We recognise the incredible work that public sector workers have continued to do throughout the pandemic, and the challenges many of them have faced as key workers, and it's right that wages across the public sector will increase for each of the next three years. \"We have also backed public services with the largest real-terms increase in overall departmental spending for any Parliament this century.\" The government is also raising the National Living Wage to £9.50 an hour from April and is providing £12bn this financial year and next to help families with the cost of living, including helping households with their energy bills. Prices went up at their fastest rate in 30 years in the year to December, with inflation hitting 5.4%. Soaring food costs and the energy bill crisis were the main factors driving price rises. In December, the Bank of England predicted that inflation could hit 6% this year, but some economists expect a 7% rate by April. ",

            "content": "Struggling UK families may need help with energy bills as inflation soars, an International Monetary Fund expert has said. It comes as the IMF predicted that the UK economy will grow more slowly than expected this year as it recovers from the Covid pandemic. The forecast for UK growth in 2022 was cut to 4.7% from 5% in the IMF's latest world economic outlook. However, this will be the fastest in the G7 industrialised nations. It partly reflects a rebound from sharp falls the UK suffered during initial pandemic lockdowns two years ago. The International Monetary Fund is an organisation of 190 countries that works to secure financial stability. Its first deputy managing director, Gita Gopinath, told the BBC that targeted help might be needed to help vulnerable households deal with higher energy bills as they face a cost-of-living squeeze. She said: \"The UK has done very well on the vaccination front, on testing and tracing and so on. \"All that has to be continued. An argument can be made that, especially for instance, in April, as more of the energy price pass-through happens, then that could be a big, sharp increase in the cost of living. \"And one could see a case for very, very targeted help to highly vulnerable households for a short space of time.\" Surging food and energy prices drove inflation to 5.4% in the 12 months to December, up from 5.1% the month before, in a blow to struggling families. The International Monetary Fund expressed concern that a Russian invasion of Ukraine could see energy prices go even higher and stay there for longer. Its first deputy managing director, Gita Gopinath, backed the idea of help with spiralling energy bills in the UK. That intervention could be helpful to the Treasury, which is currently deciding what type of help could be given to mitigate a £50-a-month rise in bills. Some MPs want the government to delay its announced rise in National Insurance, especially after lower-than-expected public borrowing figures. The Treasury is believed to be looking instead at focusing support on those most in need. On Tuesday, the IMF sharply downgraded its forecasts for the two biggest global economies - the US and China - citing high energy prices and new Covid curbs among its reasons. Overall, the IMF now expects global growth to go from 5.9% in 2021 to 4.4% in 2022, half a percentage point lower for this year than in its last prediction in October 2021. \"The global economy enters 2022 in a weaker position than previously expected,\" said the IMF report. As the new Omicron Covid-19 variant spread, countries had reimposed restrictions, it added. \"Rising energy prices and supply disruptions have resulted in higher and more broad-based inflation than anticipated, notably in the US and many emerging market and developing economies. \"And the ongoing retrenchment of China's real estate sector and slower-than-expected recovery of private consumption have limited growth prospects.\" The IMF predicted that the higher levels of inflation currently seen in the global economy would go on for longer than it anticipated in its last forecast, persisting for most of 2022. It said supply chain disruptions, energy price volatility and localised wage pressures meant that \"uncertainty around inflation and policy paths\" was high. US economic growth for this year was downgraded by the IMF from 5.2% to 4% after it removed the effects of President Joe Biden's Build Back Better fiscal policy package from its calculations. The legislation is currently stalled in Congress and is unlikely to be enacted in its present form. China's forecast for 2022 was cut from 5.6% to 4.8%. \"In China, disruption in the housing sector has served as a prelude to a broader slowdown,\" the IMF report said. \"With a strict zero-Covid strategy leading to recurrent mobility restrictions and deteriorating prospects for construction sector employment, private consumption is likely to be lower than anticipated.\" The IMF said the cut in expectations for global growth also reflected revisions among some other large emerging markets. In particular, the two biggest Latin American economies, Brazil and Mexico, suffered the largest growth downgrades. Brazil, where far-right President Jair Bolsonaro is seeking re-election later this year, is now expected to grow by just 0.3% in 2022, down from the previous forecast of 1.5%. Mexico also saw a downgrade of 1.2 percentage points and is now predicted to see growth of 2.8%. ",

CO2 is used for keeping packaged food fresh, to stun pigs and chickens before slaughter and in fizzy drinks. A supply chain crisis was averted last year when the government stepped in to broker a three-month price-fixing deal between CO2 producers and industry. The food industry said a new deal had to be reached before 31 January. \"We are concerned with just days now remaining before that agreement comes to an end, and energy prices still very high, there will be further CO2 shortages once again,\" said industry body the Food and Drink Federation (FDF). \"This could lead to shortages in the products we find on our supermarket shelves - adding further pressures to families already coping with high food-price inflation.\" Critical CO2 supply deal for food industry agreed However, it would appear that the government is unlikely to put up more money to secure supplies, saying it is up to CO2 firms to ensure continued supplies. CO2 is essential across industry and in the National Health Service. One US fertiliser firm, CF Industries, makes 60% of the UK's commercial carbon dioxide as a by-product of producing ammonia for fertiliser. Last year, it temporarily shut its facilities after fertiliser manufacturing became uneconomic because of the rising price of wholesale gas, cutting off a vital source of CO2 for other sectors. Supermarkets began reporting limited stocks of some food items, while the pig industry warned that if slaughterhouses could not process animals, then farmers would have to cull their stocks. The government intervened to persuade CF Industries to continue supplies of the gas until the end of January. CF Industries said it \"continues to negotiate with our industrial gas customers to extend CO2 off-take and pricing agreements\". ",

Northgate Yard, a £16m leisure complex being built on the site of the former Sedgemoor Splash pool, is due to be completed by the end of 2022. Project manager Stuart Martin said: \"It's really beginning to shape up.\" The former Bridgwater Community Hospital could also be converted into a hotel, gym and restaurant. A construction worker named Paul, who grew up in Bridgwater and is working on the Northgate development, told BBC Somerset: \"It means a lot to bring life into the town again. \"There's not much going on [here]. \"Taunton is your main place to go for things like this; a cinema and a bowling alley.\" The two-building complex, opposite Angel Place Shopping Centre, will include a new multiplex cinema, restaurants, a bowling alley and a sports bar. Mr Martin, who works for the council, said he had been involved in the project for more than 10 years and believed the cinema was \"quite an impressive structure\". He said the outdoor area \"will be a nice place for people to meet before going to the cinema\". Sedgemoor Splash swimming pool closed in 2009 but public consultations found local people still wanted a \"leisure scheme of some description,\" Mr Martin said. \"The council had to step in to deliver. We felt this would be a good investment of the council's money in a commercial sense.\" Another construction worker, Angus, said the project was \"quite exciting\" to work on. \"This is the biggest site I've been on. A lot happening at once.\" Meanwhile, the former Bridgwater Community Hospital could be converted into a hotel, gym, health club, day nursery and restaurant if planned proposals are approved. Roger Smith, from Bridgwater Chamber of Commerce, said: \"Having another development with the opportunity to bring more life into this part of the centre really is key to the continued redevelopment of the area.\" He said having more than a hotel on the site would be important for \"the prosperity of the town\". \"Bridgwater people are very proud of the heritage of the town and this hospital plays a big part of that,\" he added. By keeping the building mostly intact it would retain that \"identity\" for local people. It is hoped the hospital redevelopment would create a gateway for the centre of Bridgwater. \"The long-term plan has to be about regenerating the whole of the town centre,\" Mr Smith said. ",

            "content": "Holiday bookings have jumped with \"notable increases\" in trips planned for February half-term and Easter ahead of Covid travel tests being scrapped. Jet2 said bookings had increased by 30% on last week after the announcements that rules would be relaxed for people arriving in the UK. The rule changes mean fully-vaccinated people arriving in those countries from abroad do not need to take Covid tests. The change will come into effect from 04:00 GMT on 11 February. Steve Heapy, chief executive of Jet2, told the BBC the removal of testing was \"game-changer\" for the travel industry. He said demand was \"already strong\" before the rule changes for England and Scotland were announced on Monday, but said bookings had since risen further. On Tuesday, the Welsh government confirmed it was \"reluctantly retaining alignment\" with the UK government to also remove tests. However, First Minister Mark Drakeford said the devolved government would \"implement measures to encourage travellers arriving into Wales to take a lateral flow test, plus a follow-up PCR test if positive\". Northern Ireland has since announced it will align with the other nations. The phasing out of domestic testing rules has resulted in demand growing for flights and holidays through January, though the increase in bookings is from a lower base than pre-pandemic times. What are the travel rules? Jet2 has said it has planned a larger summer holiday package for 2022 than 2019. \"We have seen a notable increase in demand for holidays and flights across all seasons, particularly February half term, the Easter holidays and Summer 22,\" Mr Heapy said. The company said the Canary Islands, Balearic Islands, mainland Spain, Italy and Portugal were \"selling strongly\". It added there was \"enormous growth\" for bookings for Greece, Turkey and Cyprus. Ski flights to Geneva, Salzburg Grenoble, Chambery and Lyon were also up, the company said, after being buoyed by France also easing some restrictions on UK travellers. Although testing requirements have been removed in the UK, people travelling abroad will also be required to follow the isolation and testing requirements of the country they are heading to. According to online travel search firm Skyscanner, there are currently 106 countries, including Spain, Italy and the US, with low restrictions where people who are fully vaccinated can visit by showing proof of vaccine status or a negative test. The Netherlands, along with 19 other destinations, have moderative restrictions where forms of quarantine are required. A total of 30 places still have major travel restrictions, such as Australia and New Zealand. Laura Lindsay, head of consumer travel at Skycanner, said \"confidence\" was returning for people to book, with the travel search engine seeing the \"firm favourites get straight back on travellers' agendas\". \"Spain, Portugal and the US are all topping the charts again as they did in 2019 before the pandemic,\" she said. Aside from changes for fully-jabbed travellers, rules have been eased for unvaccinated people, who will no longer have to take a day eight test or self isolate, but will still need pre-departure and day two tests. However, everyone arriving in the UK, regardless of vaccination status, will need to fill in a passenger locator form. Tour operator Tui told the BBC it had also seen a \"big increase in bookings\". Andrew Flintham, managing director for Tui UK said, the removal of arrival tests was a \"huge leap forwards in getting travel back to normal\". Long-haul destinations including Mexico, Dominican Republic, Cape Verde and the Canary Islands were proving the most popular for winter escapes, he added \"We now expect summer 2022 bookings to be back to pre-pandemic levels.\" EasyJet boss Johan Lundgren said every occasion the government had reduced some international travel restrictions, the airline had seen \"big surges in the sales numbers\". \"We now hope testing and travel is a thing of the past which it should because it was never an efficient measure in anyway to reduce the spread of the virus,\" he told the BBC. Elsewhere, Thomas Cook, which was rebranded as an online holiday company after it collapsed in 2019, said Turkey and Italy were among the most in-demand destinations for summer holidays. It said overall weekly bookings were up by \"more than 300% on 2021\". Boss Alan French said: \"After two years of bans and changing rules, it feels like we've really turned a corner and with the end of testing in sight we expect to see even more people look ahead to a summer of sunshine, beaches and glistening blue seas.\" However, the trade body for the testing firm industry has said the rules have been lifted too quickly. On Monday, Tom Watson, chairman of the Laboratory and Testing Industry Organisation, said the body had \"consistently backed relaxing unnecessary restrictions\", but added the \"only way\" to avoid future lockdowns was to maintain \"a robust Covid testing regime to quickly discover new variants\".

Octopus Energy's Greg Jackson said it was the only option able to \"make a real difference to all customers\". Spreading the cost would mean consumers would avoid hefty increases to their energy bills, he said. Energy costs are expected to jump in April when the price cap is revised. In an email to customers, Mr Jackson said: \"Spreading the cost of this sudden spike over several years will allow us to make the imminent April rise much, much smaller - more like £12 per month - and adjust prices to gradually cover the cost over time.\" The price cap, which sets the maximum rate suppliers can charge for a default tariff, means the typical household should pay no more than £1,277. The new level for the cap, which applies to England, Scotland and Wales, is due to be announced on 7 February. Industry trade body Energy UK has already warned that bills could jump by 50% this year unless the government intervenes. We don't know how high bills will go - energy boss\nGovernment discusses support for higher fuel bills\nWhy are gas prices so high? The government has been talking to the energy industry for a number of weeks to try to agree on a way forward to tackle soaring prices. Goldman Sachs, the investment bank, said problems currently impacting gas supplies in Europe could continue into 2025. \"The high energy prices seen in recent months are not necessarily a one-off,\" it said. A number of options have been discussed, including reducing the 5% VAT on bills, increasing the Warm Homes Discount offered to people in receipt of certain benefits and shifting green levies - which fund renewable energy projects - from bills into general taxation. Some form of financial mechanism to smooth prices, such as loans to energy companies to be paid back over a number of years, has also been discussed, though it is an option that doesn't have the full backing of the industry itself. This month, the boss of Britain's biggest energy provider, Centrica, told the BBC he wasn't in favour of the move, and that it would amount to a \"bailout\" for the sector. Octopus Energy's Mr Jackson told customers there were a number of options to finance such a scheme. \"Private funding can be found for deferring these costs which means we may be able to do it without Treasury funding\", though he added: \"Of course, that may be an option too\". He warned that when the price cap is updated in April, the average bill is likely to rise by as much as 75% compared to the same time last year. \"That's another £60 a month: a huge burden for most homes,\" he said. He said a huge amount of effort was being made by energy companies, the regulator Ofgem, and the government \"to try and ensure there is decisive, collective action that best protects as many households as possible\". But he acknowledged the outcome of the discussions currently taking place was uncertain. \"Honestly, I don't know if we'll be successful. But if we aren't, it won't be from lack of trying.\" ",

The move, part of a restructuring plan, comes as the firm faces heavy criticism over ongoing postal delays. The company has been struggling to cope with Covid-related staff absences. Those have led to severe delays in some areas and the regulator, Ofcom, has said it may impose fines where services have fallen short. Some customers have complained of waiting up to a month for important deliveries, including prescriptions and legal documents as well as late Christmas cards. Ofcom said recently that it was \"concerned about these delays and have made it clear to Royal Mail that it must take steps to improve its performance as the effects of the pandemic subside\". Large parts of London, Manchester, Hertfordshire, Wales and Scotland, have been particularly affected by the delays. In early January, around 15,000 - or more than one in 10 - of Royal Mail's staff were off sick or isolating. But Simon Thompson, who took over as chief executive of the delivery firm a year ago, said the situation was now improving. Royal Mail staff absences almost double 2018 level\nLondon hit worst by Royal Mail delivery delays\nAre you experiencing postal delays? Email haveyoursay@bbc.co.uk. Mr Thompson said absences had been \"a headwind\" in delivering productivity targets. Between April and December last year the firm had spent more than £340m on overtime, additional temporary staffing and sick pay, he said. Royal Mail said the latest planned job cuts would incur a charge of £70m but would deliver annual savings of around £40m. The company axed a fifth of its managers - around 2,000 posts - in June 2020, shortly after the start of the pandemic. Royal Mail has seen deliveries particularly hard hit by staff sickness and absences with the advent of Omicron, with around one in eight staff affected over the Christmas period. But even before that, it had repeatedly failed to meet delivery targets. With pressure from customers, the regulator and shareholders for more efficient operations, Royal Mail is undertaking an overhaul. And its managers will bear the brunt. The company says that losing 700 posts will enable it to streamline its structure and improve local performance and ultimately, save £40m per year. It will now have to consult unions on the proposals. In the first year of the pandemic Royal Mail saw rising demand for its services as people switched to shopping online at home. Over the past year, with High Street stores open again, that demand has fallen back, but Royal Mail's chairman Keith Williams said the trend for higher numbers of parcels being delivered remained. The volume of domestic parcels being delivered by Royal Mail between October and December was 33% above pre-pandemic levels in 2019, but 7% lower than in 2020. However, the number of letters Royal Mail handled in the October to December period declined compared to both 2020 and 2021. Royal Mail said it believed it was retaining its share of the deliveries market, although it saw a slower than expected pick-up around the Black Friday shopping period. \"The past few months have demonstrated that the challenge for Royal Mail is to improve both quality and efficiency,\" Mr Williams said. Price rises in the UK and elsewhere have raised costs for both its domestic and international businesses, Royal Mail said. \"Looking forwards, the delivery of our transformation and modernisation plans remain incredibly important in light of the fast‐paced change we are seeing and ongoing inflationary pressures.\" Royal Mail also said that as government guidance over Covid-19 changed, there would be fluctuations in the number of Covid tests it would be delivering. The firm agreed in December to double deliveries of tests to a total of 900,000 a day, including both PCR and lateral flow tests. Over the nine months to the end of last year, Covid tests accounted for between 4% and 6% of Royal Mail's parcel volumes. ",

            "header": "UK toy sales fell last year amid supply disruption",
            "content": "Toy sales have fallen as the industry faced availability and reliability issues amid disruption from the Covid pandemic. Sales in the UK dropped by 3% last year compared with the previous 12 months, said market research group NPD. The supply of materials and transportation of finished toys, particularly on shipping containers are creating a headache for manufacturers. But a toy industry trade body said the sector was remarkably resilient. Bucking the trend were scientific and educational toys, with some suggestion that their popularity among girls in particular could have been inspired by the Gilbert effect. Prof Dame Sarah Gilbert became a household name as one of the creators of the Oxford-AstraZeneca Covid vaccine. The Barbie-maker Mattel even created a doll of Dame Sarah which, at the time, she described as \"very strange\" but she said she hoped it would inspire children to pursue a career in science. England's run in the Euro football championships also helped sticker sales. The British Toy and Hobby Association (BTHA) said that 2020 had proved to be an unexpected bumper year for the sale of larger toys and games. Demand from families for entertainment during lockdown drove the market. That momentum waned last year, but sales were still 2% higher than pre-pandemic levels. The average price of toys in 2021 fell 2% to £10.22 compared to the previous year. Despite encouragement from the industry to buy early at Christmas, sales rose sharply by 35% in the final week before Christmas. The rise was the result, in part, of Christmas Day falling on a Saturday allowing for a full week of trading in the preceding days. The challenge in the year to come and for Christmas 2022 is centred around supply chain problems, according to Kerri Atherton from the BTHA. She said that competition for shipping containers between industries and port congestion meant toy manufacturers were facing issues with the supply of materials and delivering toys to the retail market. That pushed up their costs, which could ultimately be reflected in consumer prices. Availability of products and reliability of shipments were also an issue, she said. \"There are never going to be empty shelves in toy shops, but there is an impact,\" she said. The BTHA's annual trade show, showcasing some of the products likely to be seen in stores at Christmas, is taking place over the next three days in London's Olympia. ",

            "header": "Inflation surge sends UK interest payments higher",
            "content": "Interest payments on government borrowing last month hit a record high for December as surging inflation increased the cost of debt. The Office for National Statistics (ONS) said interest on government debt hit £8.1bn last month - up from £2.7bn a year earlier. The increase came as soaring energy costs sent inflation to a 30-year high. Official borrowing - the gap between spending and tax receipts - last month was a lower-than-forecast £16.8bn. The figure was down £7.6bn from the same month a year earlier, with the Treasury's coffers bolstered by more income from housing stamp duty and fuel taxes. But public debt interest payments are linked to the Retail Prices Index of inflation, which hit 7.5% last month, the highest rate since March 1991. For the financial year to date, borrowing has now reached £146.8bn, the second-highest figure for the period since records began in 1993. Where does the government borrow billions from?\nWhy are prices rising so quickly?\nSurging food prices push inflation to 30-year high Chancellor Rishi Sunak, under pressure to relax planned tax rises in April, underlined the impact of rising debt repayments in a statement after the figures were released. He said: \"We are supporting the British people as we recover from the pandemic through our Plan for Jobs and business grants, loans and tax reliefs. \"Risks to the public finances, including from inflation, make it even more important that we avoid burdening future generations with high debt repayments. \"Our fiscal rules mean we will reduce our debt burden while continuing to invest in the future of the UK.\" In total, more than 50 schemes have been announced by the UK government and devolved nations to support individuals and businesses during the coronavirus pandemic. The consensus among economists was that December borrowing would reach about £18.5bn. However, with the rate of inflation set to continue rising until about April, analysts at Capital Economics said further falls were unlikely. National Insurance (NI) is set to rise in April, piling more cost-of-living pressure on struggling households. Although Mr Sunak has so far given no signal he will bow to pressure to scrap the rise, Capital Economics said the December figures suggest he \"would have enough fiscal room to cancel\" the NI rise without too much damage to the nation's finances. Overall the public purse may be in better shape than some had feared - but that doesn't mean the chancellor is in a generous mood. The amount of interest the Treasury paid on its debts in December was three times what it was a year ago. About a quarter of public debt is linked to inflation as measured by the Retail Prices Index. And that inflation is now at a 30-year high of over 7%, and is set to rise further in the coming months. Moreover, interest rates themselves are likely to rise in a bid to curb price rises - and every 1% on rates adds £20bn to the cost of public debt repayments. It's mounting cost that a chancellor who is intent on reducing borrowing has zoomed in on. Rishi Sunak has stressed that it's \"important that we avoid burdening future generations with high debt repayments\". That may be his way of hinting that he won't be swayed by calls to delay looming tax changes that are set to take a further chunk out of household budgets, and that the Treasury is prepared to give only limited help to reduce the pain of soaring energy costs. Economists at the Institute of Fiscal Studies say that the chancellor does have the financial wiggle room to at least delay tax rises for now. But they also say that those rises will have to eventually come, faced with rising demands from the likes of an ageing population, the public finances are to be knocked into a more sustainable state.

            "content": "Low earners are more likely to keep working for longer when the state pension age rises, a report has concluded. The age at which people are entitled to claim the state pension rose from 65 to 66 between 2018 and 2020. Researchers at the Institute for Fiscal Studies (IFS) found employment rates at 65 rose faster in less affluent areas. Campaigners say the findings should be considered amid plans to raise the state pension age further. Demands to delay rises in the state pension age\nExperts say £10,900 a year needed to retire The IFS said that in the most deprived fifth of areas, the employment rate for women aged 65 rose from 15% to 28%, and from 24% to 34% for men. In the most prosperous areas, employment rates at age 65 rose more gently, from 23% to 27% for women and from 38% to 43% for men. This almost certainly reflected the greater need for income at older ages among those living in poorer areas, the IFS said. Jonathan Cribb, an author of the report, said: \"The sharp increases in employment have come in particular from those in poorer areas, and for those who have lower levels of education, suggesting that without a state pension they cannot afford to retire.\" In general, more than nine in 10 people aged 65 did not change their plans to keep working or not at the age of 65 purely because of the higher state pension age. That was because most had either stopped working earlier, or had always had plans to work beyond state pension age. Some were unable to work for health reasons. Emily Andrews, deputy director for evidence at the Centre for Ageing Better, which funded the research, said there should be \"meaningful support\" to help workless people in their 60s get back into paid work. At present, the age at which people are eligible for the state pension is set to be raised to 67 by 2028, and then eventually to 68 - although there have been calls for a reconsideration. In December, the Department for Work and Pensions (DWP) announced that the next review of the state pension age would start, headed by Baroness Neville Rolfe. \"The government needs to make sure that decisions on how to manage its costs are, robust, fair and transparent for taxpayers now and in the future. It must also ensure that as the population becomes older, the state pension continues to provide the foundation for retirement planning and financial security,\" the DWP said. ",

            "content": "European markets dropped sharply on Monday as concerns about military tension between Russia and Ukraine and interest rate rises prompted sell-offs. In London, the FTSE 100 fell more than 2.6%, while exchanges in Germany and France slid nearly 4%. But shares in the US staged a rebound and closed in positive territory despite falling more than 2% earlier. The swings came ahead of a meeting of the US central bank and amid warnings of a potential invasion in Ukraine. Nato on Monday said it was putting forces on standby, after Russia deployed some 100,000 troops and heavy armour at the Ukrainian border. On Sunday, the situation prompted the US, the UK and Australia to order diplomats' families to leave Kyiv. \"Ukraine clearly is a concern that's weighing on the markets today,\" said Darren Schuringa, chief executive officer of investment adviser ASYMmetric ETFs. \"This will continue to weigh on the markets for the foreseeable future until there's some type of resolution and more clarity as to what the outcome looks like.\" Is Russia preparing to invade Ukraine? Concerns about inflation, Covid and other issues have led to three weeks of consecutive declines on US markets. The tech-heavy Nasdaq has fallen more than 10% from its previous high - a drop considered a market \"correction\" - and the broad-based S&P 500 is flirting with a similar decline. Meanwhile, the price of Bitcoin, which hit a high of $69,000 in November, has almost halved since, dropping below $35,000 on Monday, before recovering ground to more than $36,000. Monday saw moments of torrid selling piling onto January's losses, with the Dow down more than 1,000 points - nearly 3% - at one point. But the index, which includes many of America's biggest companies, closed nearly 0.3% higher. The Nasdaq reversed a more than 3% drop to end 0.6% higher, while the S&P 500 finished 0.3% up. The swings come as investors wait for action by the US central bank, which has said it expects to respond to soaring US inflation by raising interest rates this year. Such moves typically depress stock prices by making other kinds of investments more attractive. Investors have also been also selling shares as they try to position themselves ahead of a wave of reports from companies about their end-of-year performance. Last week, Netflix, one of the biggest names to share results so far, disappointed analysts with its forecast for the upcoming months, prompting shares to plunge more than 20%. The declines were seen as a possible warning about other firms. Walt Disney, which has been focusing on its streaming strategy to compete with Netflix, was among the biggest initial losers on the Dow on Monday, down more than 4% at one point, while Tesla, which reports this week, fell more than 6%. Shares in both firms later recovered, with Disney ending flat and Tesla down about 1.5%. ",

            "content": "The chief executive of Scottish beer giant Brewdog has been accused of inappropriate behaviour and abuse of power in the workplace by former staff. More than 15 ex-Brewdog workers have spoken out about CEO James Watt to the BBC's Disclosure programme. Former Brewdog USA workers said Mr Watt's behaviour made female bartenders feel \"uncomfortable\" and \"powerless\". Lawyers for Mr Watt said the allegations were false and he denied behaving inappropriately. Brewdog was founded in 2007 by Mr Watt - then just 24 - and his friend Martin Dickie and it has its headquarters in Ellon in the north east of Scotland. The company, which has more than 100 bars and employs more than 2,000 people worldwide, says it is worth about £2bn. In 2016, Brewdog opened its first bar in the US - in Columbus, Ohio - and it now has eight across three states. The BBC Scotland Disclosure team started investigating the company after almost 300 former and current Brewdog employees signed a letter last year accusing Mr Watt of presiding over a toxic culture of fear. The documentary The Truth about Brewdog features interviews with 12 former Brewdog USA staff who have alleged inappropriate behaviour and abuse of power in the workplace by Mr Watt. The documentary features claims that: Mr Watt was witnessed by staff kissing an intoxicated customer on a roof terrace bar\nFemale bartenders were advised how to avoid unwelcome attention from Mr Watt\nManagers would try to schedule certain female staff to be off to avoid Mr Watt's visits\nOne bartender said she felt \"powerless\" to prevent unwelcome attention from Mr Watt\nMr Watt, while on trips to his US bars, took women on late night private brewery tours, leaving staff feeling uncomfortable\nMr Watt flirted with a staff member before taking her to the roof of a Brewdog building in view of other staff. Katelynn Ising, who worked in DogTap, Brewdog's flagship bar and brewery in Canal Winchester, Ohio, said female staff would dress down when they knew Mr Watt would be in their bars. She said: \"We would make a point to warn new girls - like, 'Hey, just so you know, James Watt's coming to town. \"Just, kind of, leave after your shift, don't really hang around [and] don't always do your hair and makeup that day, like don't catch his attention.'\" Katelynn said she witnessed Mr Watt take female customers on late night tours of the US brewery, next to the DogTap. \"Sometimes there would be one woman, sometimes there would be a gaggle of women,\" she said. \"They were always intoxicated, they were in their twenties usually. They were very pretty, and he would say he's taking them on a private tour of the brewery.\" Former duty manager Jackie English said she witnessed Mr Watt doing similar things. She said: \"There were three separate nights… [he'd]… come into the building with a girl, a young female, you know, cute little blondes and he would take them into the brewery… to give them a tour or whatever.\" Jackie said this behaviour made her feel \"uncomfortable\". She said: \"You're showing your employees that you can do whatever you want because of who you are and who your name is. That's how it felt a lot of times.\" Mr Watt's lawyer told the BBC this allegation was false. \"Mr Watt regularly takes both women and men, friends and customers on evening tours of the brewery,\" the lawyer said. \"It is not true to say that those who accompany him are intoxicated. The claim that he did, was made by an employee in June 2021. \"It was fully investigated - the claims were not substantiated - no further action was warranted by Brewdog USA HR.\" Dylan Gray was a manager at Brewdog Franklinton, in Columbus, Ohio. He told the programme: \"I would schedule certain female staff around him so they would not be there. I would schedule more men at nights when he was there. I would sit behind the bar with female staff so they wouldn't feel uncomfortable.\" Brewdog flouted US laws over beer imports One bartender, who asked not to be named, told the programme that Mr Watt was \"a starer\". \"He liked to stare,\" she said. \"I just wanted to leave [and] not really deal with it.\" She said she would ask to have her shifts changed in order to avoid him. \"What do you do when that's your boss, the head of the company? You can't really tell them no, or cut them off - you feel a little bit powerless,\" she said. Manager Dylan Gray said the female bartender discussed her concerns with him. He said: \"It didn't make me feel good, to have someone who is your captain to make you feel that way, that shouldn't be how it is. \"It was disappointing and I'm more or less disappointed in myself that I couldn't make something happen sooner.\" Dylan claimed he would have been \"canned long ago\" if he confronted Mr Watt. Mr Watt's lawyer told the BBC: \"This is categorically denied. At no time has Mr Watt given unwelcome attention to any female bartender. That account is not true - this was fully investigated by Centric HC who concluded that there was no substance to these claims.\" The lawyer said following enquiries by Brewdog, none of the managers interviewed had any knowledge of staff attempting to change shifts to avoid Mr Watt. Former manager Meg Herman told the BBC Mr Watt had been \"flirtatious\" with an employee one evening at their Canal Winchester HQ. She said: \"He ends up going up to the roof with her, and no-one on staff, that was downstairs, felt comfortable with it. \"He could've gone anywhere else but he didn't. He did it at the brewery. And that is a power trip.\" Mr Watt's lawyer told the BBC that their client \"has never been on the roof of the DogTap, either on his own or accompanied by anyone.\" Duty manager Nathan Quick worked in Brewdog's Franklinton bar until last year. He is one of two former staff who say they witnessed Mr Watt having a sexual encounter on the roof terrace bar. \"He was on the rooftop kissing with his hand up the shirt of this young lady,\" he said. \"It wasn't uncommon for us to have the perception that that was going on, but for us to physically see it was something else.\" Mr Watt's lawyer said: \"At no time did Mr Watt have a sexual encounter on the roof terrace of the Franklinton bar. \"We hold a statement from the only party that Mr Watt could have been present with at the Franklinton Bar. She has confirmed in her statement that Mr Watt and her did visit the roof briefly, but absolutely no sexual encounter took place.\" \"She has also confirmed that far from being intoxicated; she drove herself home that evening.\" Mr Watt's lawyer said that they \"hold a statement from the manager of Brewdog Franklinton, that it has never been reported to him, nor does he have any knowledge of Mr Watt ever having any kind of sexual encounter with someone on the rooftop bar\". The BBC investigation spoke to almost 100 former and current Brewdog staff. Most of those who still work at the company said they were afraid to speak publicly for fear of losing their jobs. One current employee was willing to speak publicly. Kayla McGuire works in the brewery in Ohio. \"I don't think that leaders should be able to intimidate their staff,\" she said. \"I don't [think] anyone should have to go to work and be afraid of what's going to happen to them, especially not in an industry that should be joyful and fun and creative.\" She said Mr Watt's behaviour around women was a talking point among staff at Brewdog USA. \"Those allegations have made many of us uncomfortable. Myself included,\" she said. James Watt declined to be interviewed for the BBC Disclosure programme. Brewdog chairman Allan Leighton said he had been given assurances from Mr Watt that the BBC's claims were not accurate, and were based on misinformation. Mr Leighton said: \"James has committed to making improvements to his management style.\" He also noted: \"Since publication of the open letter in 2021, the Board has overseen a major independent review into our culture and we have implemented a wide-ranging action plan to address the issues raised.\" The BBC Disclosure programme makes no allegations of criminal behaviour with women by Mr Watt.

            "content": "A flying car capable of hitting speeds over 100mph (160kmh) and altitudes above 8,000ft (2,500m) has been issued with a certificate of airworthiness by the Slovak Transport Authority. The hybrid car-aircraft, AirCar, is equipped with a BMW engine and runs on regular petrol-pump fuel. It takes two minutes and 15 seconds to transform from car into aircraft. The certification followed 70 hours of flight testing and more than 200 take-offs and landings, the company said. \"AirCar certification opens the door for mass production of very efficient flying cars,\" its creator, Prof Stefan Klein, said. \"It is official and the final confirmation of our ability to change mid-distance travel forever.\" In June, the flying car completed a 35-minute flight between international airports in Nitra and Bratislava, Slovakia. The company told BBC News it planned \"to fly to London from Paris in near future\". Dr Steve Wright, senior research fellow in avionics and aircraft systems, at the University of the West of England, said the news was \"a good step down the road\" for the company and made him \"cautiously optimistic that I am going to see a few AirCars one day - but I think there is still a way to go\". Other companies are also developing vehicles that can fly and be driven on the roads. The three-wheeled PAL-V Liberty, which flies like a gyrocopter, is road legal in Europe and working towards European Union Aviation Safety Agency certification. But Dr Wright is cautious about how much mass appeal flying cars may have. \"Are flying cars the future? Yes... and no,\" he said. \"The personal-transport revolution is definitely coming but not really looking like this. \"From a transport point of view, it has a niche - although, a very interesting niche.\" The AirCar takes off and lands like a conventional plane and requires a pilot's license to fly. But a number of companies are working on unpiloted air-taxi services with autonomous flight and vertical landing and take-off. Promoters hope they will be a convenient and flexible form of transport - and some are attracting significant investment. Also on Monday, Boeing announced it was investing an additional $450m (£334m) into Wisk, the California-based autonomous-air-taxi company it owns with Kitty Hawk, a company launched by Google co-founder Larry Page.

            "content": "Northampton has one of the worst rates of vacant units in the UK, a think tank said. According to a report by Centre for Cities, 24.5% of the town centre's units were empty after June 2021. That figure made it the eighth worst in the country, with Newport in south Wales landing the top spot at 33%. Andrew Carter, chief executive of Centre for Cities, said despite this, the areas were \"well placed to recover quickly\". In towns and cities across the East of England, High Street businesses reported that they had lost more than half a year's takings on average. Central Cambridge was the worst affected when it came to takings, losing 36 weeks of sales since March 2020, Centre For Cities said. 'Friends thought we were mad opening a shop here'\nFailing town can find a 'new kind of vibrancy'\nDebenhams is 'last of the giants' to leave town Businesses in Norwich, Peterborough and Ipswich were also among those hardest hit - losing 33, 32 and 31 weeks' worth of takings respectively. In many places, the loss of sales was due to an increase in business closures, Centre for Cities said. It added that there should be a campaign to encourage people back to town and city centres.

            "content": "Banknote printer De La Rue has warned that supply chain issues triggered by the pandemic and rising energy costs will hit its profits. The company, which prints banknotes for the Bank of England, said it faced higher costs of raw materials and microchips, \"primarily\" due to Covid. De La Rue said Covid variants had also resulted in higher staff absences. It added annual profits were now set to be between £36m and £40m, rather than about £45m as first estimated. The warning sent the London-listed company's down by 30% on Monday. UK-based De La Rue prints cash for about 140 central banks and employs more than 2,500 people globally. Chief executive Clive Vacher said factories in the UK, Malta and Sri Lanka had been the worst hit by Covid infections. \"The spikes in absences have looked very similar to the spikes we've seen in the general population across the pandemic,\" he told the PA news agency. \"The Omicron and Delta variants have caused substantially increased employee absences in our manufacturing facilities globally, which will result in lower total operational output for the full year.\" The boss said ink and paper was not a \"big problem\" as it could be purchased at fixed prices. However, he added raw materials used in production which were bought at so-called spot prices were proving costly due to prices being \"quite volatile\". Mr Vacher said in a trading statement the profit adjustments would delay the company reaching its \"turnaround plan objectives\" by a year. \"Even though it's a disappointing set of results it's still indicative of a fundamentally different business from the one I inherited when I arrived,\" he added. The turnaround plan includes the company cutting costs and investing in polymer notes and in its authentication business. The plan, introduced in February 2020, came after De La Rue warned there was a risk the firm could collapse.

            "header": "Major investor will target bosses at firms failing on climate",
            "content": "A major UK investment fund has said it will vote to try to get directors kicked out of firms that fail to make good on environmental pledges. Aviva Investors also wants bosses' pay to be linked to sustainability goals. It is the latest big investment firm to ramp up the pressure on corporations in a bid to make them clean up their acts. BlackRock, the world's largest fund, has told the firms it invests in to step up on sustainability or face the consequences. Aviva Investors, which has £262bn of assets under management, set out its expectations in a letter that will be sent to 1,500 firms in 30 countries this week. The fund said it had broadened its definition of sustainability and would now focus on issues such as biodiversity and human rights, alongside existing priorities like climate change and executive pay. \"We will hold boards and individual directors accountable where the pace of change does not reflect the urgency required,\" said the annual letter from Aviva Investors boss Mark Versey. UK firms will have to disclose climate impact\nEasy ways to make your savings fight climate change Mr Versey said there had been an \"alarming\" 68% decrease in animal and plant species between 1970 and 2016. \"This is of serious concern as ecosystem services provided by the natural world underpin our economies and societies and will increasingly become an important driver of company valuations,\" Mr Versey said, adding that more than half of the world's economic output is \"reliant on biodiversity\". On human rights, Aviva expects companies it backs to scrutinise the impact they have when doing business, and to take action to stop harm. Firms will need to give more detailed explanations of how they intend to meet environmental goals, it added. Mirza Baig, Aviva Investors' head of environmental, social and corporate governance, told the BBC that some companies intentionally set vague targets to avoid being held to account. He said Aviva would increasingly use its vote as a shareholder to try to oust directors at firms that had a \"high impact\" on the planet but did little to rectify this. The fund may also vote against executive pay deals if a firm is falling short, and as a last resort could withdraw its investment. Last year 280 firms changed their practices after pressure from Aviva Investors, Mr Baig said. However, he urged more big investment firms to use their \"loud\" and \"influential\" voices to drive change. \"If there was enough pressure being put on businesses then the world would look very different,\" he said. Big investment funds are increasingly leaning on firms to make them change the way they do business. Last week Larry Fink, the chief executive of BlackRock, the world's biggest investment fund, denied that the firm was being \"woke\" in calling for stronger climate policies from companies. Instead, he said the move made good business sense at a time when the public increasingly expects companies to behave ethically. He insisted his firm was being capitalist in its outlook, adding: \"Make no mistake, the fair pursuit of profit is still what animates markets; and long-term profitability is the measure by which markets will ultimately determine your company's success.\" ",

            "header": "Inflation: Four things that are going up in price and why",
            "content": "Everyone is braced for financial pain as the cost of living rises this year, particularly with energy bills likely to soar from April. But it is not just gas that is pushing up prices at their fastest rate for nearly 30 years. Here are some of the less obvious items which have recorded rapid price rises, and some of the reasons behind the increases. Those families who still sit down to eat a traditional roast dinner together are having to be a little more imaginative if they are trying to keep the costs down. Prices of fresh beef rose by 8.6% from a year earlier, information from data firm Kantar shows. Fresh lamb prices were up even more steeply, rising by 10% to around £11 per kilogramme. Potatoes - another Sunday lunch staple - were also highlighted as a factor in pushing up December's official inflation rate (which measures the rising cost of living), by the Office for National Statistics (ONS). In fact, food prices in general were key to the rate rising to a level not seen for three decades. Fraser McKevitt, head of retail and consumer insight at Kantar, says that a lid had been kept on grocery prices for some time, especially at Christmas, but it is \"inevitable\" that increases are to come. Supermarkets are facing cost pressures of their own from logistics, manufacturing, farming and distribution. Problems such as driver shortages and rising energy prices will add to those pressures. \"Retailers will be having robust discussions with suppliers, but delayed costs have to flow through and be reflected in what consumers pay,\" he says. He points out that when shoppers are faced with grocery price rises of more than 3% or 4% a year, they tend to make bigger decisions, such as cutting back, seeking out promotions, or buying cheaper own-label products. The trouble is, he says, there are price rises \"in nearly every category across the supermarket shelves\" and the price gap between discount brands and others is narrower than was once the case. Richard Walker, boss of supermarket chain Iceland, says he has been seeing an \"alarming\" rise in the use of food banks. Open the bathroom cabinet and the moisturisers and cleansers you see inside may well have got more expensive recently. Prices of skincare products typically rose by 9.6% in the 12 weeks to Boxing Day compared with the same period a year earlier, data from the same Kantar survey shows. Prestige brands, in particular, went up in price even though demand fell, according to analysts. Perhaps people were a little less hung up on their Zoom face. Skincare tells a story typical of the general cost of living squeeze at the moment, in that no one single factor is causing prices to rise. \"The cost of shipping, packaging and raw materials are on the rise and thereby brands have little choice but to increase the price of their products to ensure that their business is sustainable,\" says Emma Fishwick, from analysts NPD. She said masks, body creams and eye treatments had recorded some of the biggest price rises towards the end of the year. Customer behaviour has been changing as a result, she says. Shoppers are increasingly choosing mid-range brands, which can be 60% cheaper than the upmarket options. \"Whilst consumers feel the squeeze, as the cost of living increases, consumers are increasingly turning to these brands as a cheaper alternative,\" she says. INFLATION: Why prices are rising so quickly\nPETROL: Are we paying too much at the pump?\nGAS PRICES: How can I protect myself from rising prices?\nIMPACT: 'I'm so cold it feels like I'm sleeping outside' In the official figures, sofas and the like come under quite a broad category of \"furniture and household goods\". The ONS points out prices in the sector have been rising steadily since the start of 2021. That includes furniture, household appliances - including the cost of fitting them, and even garden equipment. The 7.4% inflation rate of this category in December was the highest since comparable data began in 1989, according to ONS calculations. Furniture prices are rising for many of the same reasons as skincare products and food. The cost of raw materials - such as wood in this case - as well as transporting them has gone up. A settee may be considered a luxury item, and one only bought new after saving up the money. A fridge, on the other hand, is a necessity for every family. Inflation is the rate at which prices are rising. If the price of a bottle of milk is £1 and it rises by 5p, then milk inflation is 5%. You may not notice price rises from month to month. But right now, prices are rising so quickly that the money people earn does not go as far. Why are prices rising so quickly?\nSeven reasons living costs are rising around the world Statisticians at the ONS featured the effect of second-hand car prices on the inflation rate as a whole, and not for the first time. They say used-car prices grew by 28% during 2021, compared with a 7.3% increase the previous year. The cost of manufacturing new cars has risen and has been made difficult by a global shortage of computer chips, as well as other materials such as copper, aluminium and cobalt. As a result fewer new vehicles have been rolling off production lines. That has meant more buyers turning to the used-car market, which has pushed up prices. Added to that, the ONS says there are concerns in the trade about fewer second-hand cars being made available owing to a dearth of one-year-old cars to sell on. Delays in new car supplies have meant extensions of lease contracts and fewer part exchanges, again affecting used car availability. ",

            "header": "First-time buyers surge: 'I couldn't keep paying rent'",
            "content": "Jake Olenick, 24, is spending almost two-thirds of his take-home pay renting a London flat but he started to get on the property ladder last year. A new job, rigorous saving and \"lucky family circumstances\" have enabled him to buy a share of a flat in Kilburn. Jake is not alone in managing to get a foot on the housing ladder in 2021. Figures from mortgage lender Halifax suggest there were a record number of first-time buyers last year, despite rising house prices and falling affordability. Jake, who is originally from New York, graduated from Oxford University and got a job in Oxford working as a games developer in 2019. Six months ago, he landed a software development job in London and moved into a West Hampstead flat with his girlfriend. That relationship broke down in October and Jake started to pay all of the rent, which worked out at about 60% of his take-home pay. \"I couldn't keep paying that much in rent and I already knew that it's almost always much better to buy,\" he said. So he started the ball rolling on buying 40% of a flat in Kilburn, sharing ownership with a housing association. In total, he'll be paying 35% of his salary on rent, mortgage and service charge when he moves in. He said one of the main reasons he was able to do this was \"extremely lucky family circumstances\". His parents had been saving for him to go to a US university, which was much more expensive than a UK one, and they were able to cover his fees at Oxford. So when he left, he had no student loans, which helped him when viewing properties. He also managed to put aside money from his job and has been saving birthday and Christmas money his whole life. Jake is really looking forward to moving into his new flat. \"I'm very excited!\" he says. \"I'll be able to put up posters, make repairs, the oven door will close, I'll be able to sleep because the windows are insulated, triple-glazed even! \"I'll be able to afford a weekend away, maybe I'll be able to afford a keyboard so I can play piano again. All sorts of things!\" There were more than 400,000 people buying their first home in 2021, up 35% from the previous year, the Halifax said. That rate dropped by 13% in 2020, when the number of Halifax buyers was about 300,000. A stamp duty holiday that started in 2020 saw house buyers rush to pick up properties - although first-time buyers were not part of this stampede. However, this meant a number of so-called \"first-rung\" homes came on to the market, which first-time buyers took advantage of in 2021, despite hikes in property prices. Esther Dijkstra, mortgage director at Halifax, said: \"There were a number of factors influencing home-buying decisions in 2021. \"While working from home and the 'race for space' was key for many, particularly movers, it's clear that the stamp duty holiday increased the availability of first-rung homes as others moved up the ladder.\" The average age of first-time buyers rose to 32, up from 29 in 2011. Ms Dijkstra said that this rise in average age was mostly due to \"the need to save a significant deposit to get on the housing ladder\". The average buyer used a £53,935 deposit on a first property costing £264,140. Because of difficulties raising a deposit, the gap between the purchase price and the deposit widened in every region in the UK, Ms Dijkstra added. It's only in three local authority areas in Scotland that homes are either more affordable - in Clackmannanshire and Moray - or as affordable - in East Ayrshire, since 2011. Houses in the rest of the UK have become less affordable since then, Halifax said. On average, properties now cost nearly seven times the annual salary of first-time buyers. The limit for affordability is considered to be four times the average income. In some areas, affordability has dropped very sharply since 2011. In one London borough, Merton, affordability has halved, with similar drops, albeit not as pronounced, in Reigate and Banstead, South Kesteven, Westminster and Ashford. Anya Martin, director of campaign group PricedOut, which pushes for more affordable housing, said: \"House prices and rents have been pushed out of reach by decades of failure to build enough homes. \"First-time buyer schemes may help a few, but ultimately they are designed to help people stretch to high prices, rather than dealing with the cause of those high prices.\" Many first-time buyers get help from their parents to be able to afford a home, but some use a mortgage firm that was itself set up by frustrated first-time buyers. Retail worker Chae Sarjant is buying a home with her partner, who works for the NHS, on the same road where she grew up in East Finchley. They got a mortgage through a company called Generation Home. Chae says: \"To be honest, we couldn't have done it without them.\" Her mum \"is only able to give us as much as she is because it's a loan protected by Generation Home, so she can get it back when we move and use it in retirement\" and her stepfather has also taken a stake in the property, Chae says. \"We're buying about two minutes walk from them in East Finchley,\" she says. \"It's the same road I grew up on and it means my son gets to go to the same schools I went to. \"We're all thrilled, although we're currently in conveyancing hell,\" she says. \"It's a long and very annoying process.\" The family are hoping to move in February and \"we're really looking forward to settling down\". They have rented for the past four years, \"which has meant moving a lot, and I know my son is looking forward to that being over!\" she adds. She said they \"never really took the idea of buying our own place that seriously, to be honest\". \"Our salary has been eaten up by rent every month, so we have very little savings of our own and our income means most mortgage companies were giving us way less than we needed to afford anything even remotely close to our families,\" she said. Flats in East Finchley typically cost between £350,000 and £550,000, she said. \"Having my mum loan us the money makes us all a lot more comfortable,\" Chae adds. \"She's able to get the money back in the future and I'm a lot less stressed about affecting her retirement.\" ",

            "header": "In pictures: The changing face of UK industrial estates",
            "content": "When the UK's first industrial estates appeared in the 1930s they were built simply to boost Britain's productivity. But more than 80 years later, the industrial space is vastly changed. Among traditional hauliers, distributors and manufacturers is a growing number of firms from sectors more synonymous with the high street. Cafes, gyms, artisan restaurants and Instagrammable experiences, like axe throwing, have moved into cavernous lock-ups. Commercial property agent and former CBI Wales chairman Chris Sutton has seen the change at first hand. He said: \"Twenty or 30 years ago, industrial estates were just that. They were industrial in nature, but now we see them as a business location. \"Just in the past two years, we've seen lettings to pottery workshops, a bakery, gin distillery, gyms, craft breweries, climbing walls, funeral services, vets nutrition, a recording studio.\" There are thousands of industrial and trading estates across the UK, with many clusters of them in Wales. The idea of the industrial estate was born out of a desire to supercharge the UK's industrial production. That was certainly the idea at Wales' first trading estate in Treforest. Off the back of Wales decline in heavy industry, it became, according to Mr Sutton, \"a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity\" to rejuvenate. \"So what we've seen is that industrial accommodation provides a good location for businesses of a wide range. It's not just straightforward, sort of widget manufacturing,\" he said. Cardiff's Boneyard has transformed one corner of industrial space into a thriving creative community. Everything from pizza restaurant to psychotherapists now work from the huddle of converted containers. And it's this kind of re-use, and repurposing of industrial space that retail management expert Laura James from University of Wales Trinity St David believes is driven by a change in consumer attitude. \"The first thing to say is that consumers know that there's a need, perhaps, to travel to different destinations in order to kind of fulfil that experience that they're looking for,\" she said. \"It definitely is a different dynamic, isn't it.\" \"I think it is interesting to think that we are now looking at going to these industrial sites with a completely different environment. \"One that perhaps we wouldn't have thought of before, but what a fantastic way to try and revive shopping and revive retail and revive socialising.\" Who Cult first came to Bridgend Industrial Estate to base their fledgling clothing brand start-up. But it soon found a new market was ready to be serviced. That of destination dining. Or in their case, coffee and donuts. The coffee shop was only meant as an add-on to customers buying clothes. But demand soared. Owner Scott McGill took advantage and opened a purpose built café out of town. It has gone from strength to strength, with customers queuing through the carpark during lockdown. They're now planning a second shop in a similar space. Last year, estate agent Knight Frank said demand for industrial space had \"soared\" in Wales. It said it had hit record levels across the UK during the first half of the year among units larger than 50,000 square feet. The firm said this was largely driven by retailers and distributors expanding their online and home delivery capacity in response to growing e-commerce during the pandemic. There are planning controls which can limit retail and service activity on industrial estates and business parks. But the growth in demand for units on these estates has given rise to a secondary service industry around it. Gym manager James Gill says businesses like his can capitalise on this. \"We'll have people come in here and do work from their offices and sit in our caff for hours,\" he says. \"A lot of the guys live away, they live in England, and they'll come here for work, and when they're up here they'll train here all the time.\" © 2022 BBC.

The groups, representing small and large businesses, bosses and manufacturers, said price rises on the horizon could push millions of people into fuel poverty. They said businesses had also been hit by steep rises in bills. The Treasury said it was helping families with £12bn support. The five groups - the British Chambers of Commerce, the Confederation of British Industry, the Federation of Small Businesses, the Institute of Directors and Make UK - said businesses were likely to be faced with further costs as existing fixed tariff contracts come to an end. \"The scale of the crisis has left companies with little protection while they face dealing with soaring wage, shipping and tax costs,\" the groups said. \"Small and medium-sized businesses are the most at risk. Many companies will be left with little other choice than to pass costs on to their customers, adding further inflationary pressure.\" They said that the government should focus on \"supporting firms across the economy as they strive to manage these costs and protect cashflows\". Energy-intensive industries such as steel, ceramics and glass makers also needed support to be competitive internationally, the groups said. Rising energy costs are putting pressure on families. Inflation is running at its fastest rate for 30 years, pushed up by surging food costs and the energy bill crisis. A government spokesperson said: \"We understand the pressures people are facing with the cost of living and are providing support worth around £12bn over two years to help families. \"Support is being targeted towards the lowest paid, and we are specifically helping households with their energy bills. \"In addition, the energy price cap is currently insulating millions of consumers from high global gas prices and we'll continue to listen to consumers and businesses on how to manage the costs of energy.\" ",

            "content": "Banker António Horta-Osório, who quit as Credit Suisse boss for breaking Covid isolation rules, also went to the Euros football final, it has emerged. He resigned last weekend, with reports saying he had lost the confidence of other directors for going to the Wimbledon tennis finals last summer. But the former Lloyds Bank boss also attended the football at Wembley on the same day, sources have confirmed. News of the Euros visit was first reported by the Financial Times. The Swiss bank had organised corporate hospitality at both events, but Mr Horta-Osório took family members to both events after other guests were unable to use the tickets, the Financial Times said. The Portuguese executive attended Wimbledon and the final of the European Championship in July at a time when the UK's Covid-19 restrictions required him to be in quarantine. Mr Horta-Osório also breached Swiss Covid restrictions when, according to Reuters, he flew into the country on 28 November but left on 1 December. Swiss rules meant he should have quarantined for 10 days upon his arrival. He joined Credit Suisse in April last year following a series of scandals at the bank, including allegations of spying on employees, and had vowed to change the culture at the firm. In his resignation statement earlier this week, Mr Horta-Osório said: \"I regret that a number of my personal actions have led to difficulties for the bank and compromised my ability to represent the bank internally and externally. \"I therefore believe that my resignation is in the interest of the bank and its stakeholders at this crucial time,\" he added. The England-Italy Wembley final was later declared a Covid superspreader event by public health officials, with more than 2,000 people said to have attended while \"likely to be infectious\". ",

            "content": "UK retail sales sank 3.7% in December from the month before as the spread of Omicron deterred shoppers from visiting the High Street. Data from the Office for National Statistics also showed a 7.1% fall in clothing and other non-food sales. However, last month's figures followed a strong November amid reports there would be some shortages in the run-up to Christmas. And while food sales fell by 1%, volumes were above pre-pandemic levels. \"After strong pre-Christmas trading in November, retail sales fell across the board in December, with feedback from retailers suggesting Omicron impacted on footfall,\" said Office for National Statistics (ONS) deputy director for surveys and economic indicators Heather Bovill. \"As Plan B restrictions in England meant more people working from home, there was a notable fall for fuel sales. \"However, despite the fall in December, retail sales are still stronger than before the pandemic, with over a quarter of sales now made online.\" Fuel volumes fell by 4.7% in December on the previous month as more people worked from home, and were 6.6% below their pre-pandemic levels in February 2020. Superdry warns of price rises and ends shop discounts\nPrimark to cut 400 store management jobs\nChristmas sales soar for Marks & Spencer and Tesco Gavin Peck, chief executive of retailer The Works, told the BBC there were definite signs that consumers did their Christmas shopping earlier than usual last year. Mr Peck, whose firm on Friday reported a strong rise in sales, said it was noticeable that some shoppers were starting festive purchases as early as September. As the UK economy emerged from lockdown last year retail sales recovered quickly from their 2020 pandemic slump. But analysts say that a combination of fast-rising inflation led by surging energy prices, the prospect of higher interest rates, and planned tax rises in April may dent the appetite of consumers to keep on spending in 2022. Bethany Beckett, economist at Capital Economics, said December's fall was much bigger than expected and could drag UK growth figures lower. However, she said: \"With encouraging signs that the Omicron outbreak may have turned a corner and the government's Plan B restrictions due to be lifted next week, retail sales may recoup a bit of this fall in January and probably all of it in February and March. \"That said, with the UK's cost of living crisis looming, we expect a weakening in the consumer recovery to dampen retail sales further ahead.\" Ms Beckett said that, despite weaker economic data, the Bank of England will remain focused on accelerating inflation, and she still expects interest rates to be raised to 0.50% in early February. On Friday, The Restaurant Group, whose operations include Wagamama, Frankie & Benny's, and food kiosks, said that despite the lifting of Plan B restrictions \"consumer confidence may take longer to recover\". The company's sales figures underlined the impact of December's Covid restrictions on trading. At Wagamama, sales in October and November were up 11% and 8% respectively on the same months in 2019, before the pandemic hit, as people returned to eating out in larger numbers. But in December, Wagamama sales were just 1% up on 2019, and there were even sharper falls at Restaurant Group's other divisions. ",

            "header": "Women's state pension shortfalls a shameful shambles, MPs say",
            "content": "A £1bn shortfall in state pension payments to tens of thousands of women has been branded \"a shameful shambles\" by a committee of MPs. A total of 134,000 pensioners missed out on their full entitlement owing to errors at the Department for Work and Pensions (DWP) dating back to 1985. Some of those failures risked being repeated during a correction programme, the Public Accounts Committee said. The DWP said it was resolving cases as quickly as possible. The problem relates to the \"old\" state pension system where married women who had a small pension in their own right could claim a 60% basic state pension based on their husband's record of contributions. Widows and divorcees have also been affected. Some will receive all their entitlement, although years later than they should have done. Others will only be able to claim for 12 months of missed payments. Experts say £10,900 a year needed to retire\nTriple lock pension pledge suspended for one year Among them is Jan Tiernan, from Fife, who was initially told she was not owed any money. After nearly 100 pages of correspondence with the department, she received £1,280, but believes she is owed more. \"You need a lot of energy, and when you are 80-years-old you don't have that kind of energy. It tires you,\" she told the BBC. \"I feel let down by the system.\" She said that the extra money would have made a lot of difference to pensioners, from helping to pay heating bills to going towards a holiday. The committee's report said the errors were the result of outdated systems and heavily manual processing of pensions at the DWP.  Small errors that were not recognised added up to significant sums of money over the years. In a damning report, it concluded: The failures have led to significant losses to taxpayers. Staff costs in correcting mistakes by the end of 2023 are expected to reach more than £24m\nThere is no plan for contacting families of pensioners who have already died, and who should receive some of their entitlement\nThe DWP has been \"inconsistent\" in paying pensioners interest on the money that was owed\nIt has ignored knock-on consequences of paying lump sums, including on benefits and social care provision, to those it underpaid\nOther pensioners could be missing out and should receive clearer information about how to claim The committee said that there was a risk that the errors that led to underpayments in the first place could be repeated in the correction programme, the ninth such exercise since 2018. There was also concern that, by allocating staff to deal with this problem, backlogs occurred in dealing with claims from new pensioners who suffered delays in receiving their state pension at 66. Meg Hillier, who chairs the committee, said: \"For decades DWP has relied on a state pension payment system that is clunky and required staff to check many databases - and now some pensioners and the taxpayer are paying in spades.   \"In reality, the DWP can never make up what people have actually lost, over decades, and in many cases it's not even trying.   \"This is a shameful shambles.\" Among a string of recommendations made in the report is that the DWP should find cost-effective ways to update its computer systems. The committee also said the DWP needed to make clear how it was treating underpayments related to divorced women. Former pensions minister Sir Steve Webb, who is now a partner at consultancy LCP, first raised concerns about underpayments, and has called for divorcees to be included having their entitlement checked. \"The DWP's defensive reaction to questions and scrutiny over this issue suggest that lessons have still not been learned,\" he said.  \"There are still far too many people missing out on the state pension to which they are entitled and DWP needs to track them all down as a matter of urgency.\" A DWP spokesman said: \"Resolving the historical state pension underpayments that have been made by successive governments is a priority for the department and we are committed to doing so as quickly as possible. \"We have set up a dedicated team and devoted significant resources to processing outstanding cases, and have introduced new quality control processes and improved training to help ensure this does not happen again. Those affected will be contacted by us to ensure they receive all that they are owed.\" Have you been affected by the shortfall in state pensions? Email haveyoursay@bbc.co.uk.

            "content": "Carhartt, the work wear and outdoor gear maker, is facing calls for a boycott among conservatives opposed to its vaccine mandate for staff. The outcry comes amid fierce debate in the US over Covid-19 jabs. This month, the US Supreme Court said the government could not force large employers to make Covid-19 vaccination or weekly testing mandatory. Companies including the coffee chain Starbucks have since reversed their plans for such rules. But in a recent memo to staff, Carhartt leaders said the Supreme Court decision had not changed company requirements, which went into effect for much of their staff in early January. \"We put workplace safety at the very top of our priority list and the Supreme Court's recent  ruling doesn't impact that core value,\" wrote Carhartt's chief executive Mark Valade, a descendant of the company's founder. \"While we appreciate that there may be differing views, workplace safety is an area where we and the union that represents our associates cannot compromise.  An unvaccinated workforce is both a people and business risk that our company is unwilling to take. \" After copies of the message were circulated on social media, prominent conservatives and Republican figures weighed in. \"Well Carhartt has labelled the unvaccinated dangerous and implemented a vaccine mandate,\" conservative attorney Molly McCann wrote on Twitter. \"Pretty rich from a company sustained by the ranchers, farmers, labourers, etc. who make this country great and celebrate her values of freedom and liberty.\" \"Boycott Carhartt until they break,\" she said. The BBC is not responsible for the content of external sites.\nView original tweet on Twitter Founded in 1889, Carhartt employs more than 5,500 people globally. It is privately-owned and based in Michigan, a state in the middle of the US that is fiercely divided between Republicans and Democrats. Self-promoted as a brand for \"hard-working\" people, Carhartt made its name supplying labourers and farm workers. But it has also been embraced by fashionistas in Europe, where it has a longstanding \"Work in Progress\" design line. In recent years, which the firm has described as a \"growth period\", Carhartt caps and coats have turned up everywhere from playgrounds to the Golden Globes. A 2017 article in men's magazine Esquire described it as one of the rare brands able to transcend America's political divide - at least so far. \"Regardless of the boycott, when you think about core American fashion brands, people always mention Ralph Lauren and Levi, but Carhartt is also on that list,\" said Jeff Carvalho, co-founder of men's fashion site Highsnobiety. \"They're just quite important.\" Mr Carvalho, a collector of vintage Carhartt gear, said conservatives represent an important consumer base for the brand, but he believes it will survive the current firestorm, noting that buyers have few alternatives. He asked: \"Who are they going to turn to otherwise?\" \"It is the uniform, or tuxedo of American industry.\" Carhartt, which has factories in Kentucky and Tennessee as well as Mexico, said the \"vast majority\" of its staff are fully vaccinated or in the process of getting their jabs. It also granted \"a number\" of religious and medical exemption requests. A spokeswoman for the company said: \"Carhartt fully understands and respects the varying opinions on this topic, and we are aware some of our associates do not support this policy. \"However, we stand behind our decision because we believe vaccines are necessary to protect our workforce.\" Just over a third of US workers are now covered by vaccine mandates, according to a Gallup poll in December. While the Supreme Court struck down the national requirement, courts have been more open to states and companies setting their own policies. Investment bank Citigroup and United Airlines are among the firms that have moved forward with vaccine mandates. United Airlines's boss Scott Kirby recently told staff that the policy had saved lives. Other firms have wavered in the face of opposition. About 55% of US workers support vaccination requirements at work, a Gallup poll found in December. But more than a third were strongly opposed. Divide over the issue is linked to politics, with Republicans leading the opposition. Business groups say companies are worried about compliance costs and staff recruitment. About 63% of Americans are fully vaccinated but that number varies significantly depending on location. ",

            "content": "BT has said most customers will see bills rise by more than 9% from the end of March as households are squeezed by cost of living pressures. The telecoms giant said broadband and phone bills will jump by 9.3% following a \"dramatic increase\" in data usage over the last few years. Affected customers will pay an extra £3.50 a month on average from 31 March. But households on certain packages, as well as those claiming benefits, will be exempt. Surging food prices push inflation to 30-year high\nWhat is the UK's inflation rate and why is the cost of living going up? Around two years ago, BT changed how it raised bills, saying it would make one increase a year at the end of March of 3.9% plus inflation as measured by the consumer price index to reflect \"rising costs to the business\". Inflation is running at a 30 year-high of 5.4%. On Thursday, Nick Lane, BT's managing director for consumer customer services, wrote in a blog post: \"Price rises are never popular, but are sometimes a necessary part of business, if we're to keep up with the rising costs we face.\" Customers' data usage had \"increased dramatically\" with a 90% increase on broadband usage since 2018, and a 79% increase on mobile phones since 2019. Working from home, online education and TV streaming has led to more demands on BT's network, he said. \"Unlike most things we buy, like food, electricity or fuel, you don't pay more for using more as our data plans are unlimited, but we need to keep investing in our networks so they can handle this huge increase in demand,\" he said. However, customers on BT's at-cost social tariff, BT Home Essentials, will not see a rise in prices, and neither will those on BT Basic. To qualify for these packages, customers need to be claiming benefits such as Universal Credit. Customers with just a landline will also not experience an increase. BT said it will write to customers to tell them about the increases. Rival Virgin Media said earlier this month that prices will rise for broadband customers from the beginning of March. Price comparison website Uswitch said this would add £56 per year to bills for millions of customers. Vulnerable customers, including those on benefits, will not see prices rises, a Virgin Media spokesman said. Virgin will hike its prices for mobile customers from the beginning of April by 3.9% plus inflation as measured by the retail price index inflation rate for February. The price hikes from broadband providers will pile more pressure on household finances, with the cost of other utilities also set to increase. Energy customers are facing the prospect of a 50% increase in their gas bills from April. ",

            "content": "Superdry's boss has warned that shoppers should expect higher prices due to rising costs and says the chain will have no more sales in its shops. Julian Dunkerton said it would increase prices on some clothing items by about 2% due to rising inflation. It hopes to offset price rises by cutting the number of items it puts on sale online too. \"We are a fantastic value brand and will remain so,\" Mr Dunkerton told the BBC. Other companies, such as Kingsmill bread-owner AB Foods, Greggs and Next have all said that spiralling costs of wages, manufacturing and raw materials mean they have either put prices up or are planning to do so in the future. Official figures released on Wednesday showed that soaring food costs and energy bills had pushed up the cost of living at its fastest rate in nearly 30 years. Inflation, which measures how costs change over time, jumped to 5.4% in the 12 months to December - up from 5.1% the month before,. Next and Greggs raise prices as costs spiral\nSuperdry founder promises revival after £85m loss\nSuperdry warns of uncertainty amid Covid sales hit But Mr Dunkerton's comments came as Superdry reported a return to profit, with trading helped by new clothing ranges and a social media push using influencers. It reported a pre-tax profit of £4m in the six months to late October - up from a nearly £19m loss one year before when non-essential shops were closed during lockdown. Sales across the company dropped, however, by 1.9%. The company said that was down to the fallout of the pandemic, as well as its move to reduce discounts. It pointed to bright spots in Christmas trading, with jacket sales up 40% year-on-year, for example. The company is also looking to draw in younger shoppers with a mix of different products, and Mr Dunkerton said he hoped the brand \"is just becoming cool again\". Superdry said that mini skirts and \"70s vibe\" flares had been performing well with older teens - one of their key target markets. To capture the imagination of younger fashionistas, it has stepped up its social media marketing on Instagram and TikTok, taking cues from the likes of online giants Boohoo and Asos. The company now works with about 2,000 influencers, up six-fold year-on-year, and said its Instagram followers had increased by nearly a quarter. Mr Dunkerton told the BBC that Superdry's launch on TikTok had gone well. \"That will see huge growth for us,\" he said. \"We only started on there in September and we've got nearly 100,000 followers already - it's a key way of talking to our teenage demographic.\" Superdry, which started out as a market stall in Cheltenham, was set up by by Mr Dunkerton and James Holder, and went on to enjoy huge commercial success. But clashes followed between Mr Dunkerton and the board, leading to his resignation from the board and eventual return in 2019 to \"steady the ship\" after huge losses. Increasing engagement on social is understood to be a key part of his strategy, with the brand working with influencers and on tie-ups with celebrities such as Brooklyn Beckham and football superstar Neymar Jr. \"We want to build up our influencer base throughout Europe and start in American the tail end of this year. We will end up with an army of influencers because that's a key part of our strategy,\" Mr Dunkerton said. Its influencers are often sent free clothing, or might receive payment for their sponsored ads online. Richard Lim, chief executive of Retail Economics, said: \"The battle for customers' attention is increasingly being fought online as the pandemic has accelerated the influence of digital across the entire customer journey. \"Retailers are leveraging the reach offered by influencers across social media platforms to connect with new customers and new markets.\" Superdry's new flagship store on London's Oxford Street has also put selfies and reels at its centre. Having opened in November, it features an entire floor closed to the public, instead dedicated to hosting social stars in its showroom and a gin bar. ",

            "header": "Inflation: Seven reasons the cost of living is going up around the world",
            "content": "From buying groceries to heating our homes, the cost of living is rising sharply - not just in the UK but around the world. Global inflation - the rate at which prices rise - is at its highest since 2008. Here are some of the reasons why. Oil prices slumped at the start of the pandemic, but demand has rocketed back since, and have hit a seven-year high. In the US gasoline currently costs an average of $3.31 a gallon - up from $2.39 a gallon a year ago. It's a similar story in the UK and the EU. The price of gas has also shot up, leaving people around the world with eye-watering central heating bills. Demand from Asia has driven up prices, along with a cold winter in Europe last year, which depleted gas reserves. Petrol prices: Are we paying too much at the pump? The price of many everyday consumer goods jumped during the pandemic. Consumers stuck at home during lockdown last year splashed out on household goods and home improvements because they couldn't go to restaurants or on holiday. Manufacturers in places such as Asia - many of which faced shutdowns due to Covid restrictions - have struggled to keep up with demand since then. It's led to shortages of materials such as plastic, concrete and steel, driving up prices. Timber cost as much as 80% more than usual in 2021 in the UK and reached more than twice its typical price in the US. Major US retailers Nike and Costco have put up their prices because of higher supply chain costs. And there's a shortage of microchips, which are vital components in cars, computers and other household goods. Global shipping companies - which move goods around the world - have been overwhelmed by surging demand after the pandemic. It's meant retailers have had to pay a lot more to get those goods into stores. As a result, prices have been passed on to consumers. Sending a single 40ft container from Asia to Europe currently costs $17,000 (£12,480) - 10 times more than the year before, when it was $1,500 (£1,101). It's been accompanied by a rise in air freight fees and made worse by a lorry driver shortage in Europe. Transport bottlenecks appeared to be easing in December, with the US starting to get on top of record congestion at its ports. But Omicron and the emergence of future Covid variants could reverse these gains. How Covid disrupted our Christmas toy deliveries Many people quit the workforce or changed jobs during the pandemic. In the US, April saw more than four million people quit their jobs, according to the Department of Labor - the biggest spike on record. As a result, firms are having problems recruiting staff such as drivers, food processors and restaurant waiters. A survey of 50 major US retailers suggested 94% were having trouble filling empty roles. As a result companies are having to put up wages or offer signing-on bonuses to attract and retain staff. McDonald's and Amazon are offering hiring bonuses ranging from $200 to $1,000. Those extra employer costs are again being passed on to consumers. Global clothing brand Next have blamed planned price rises for 2022 partly on climbing wage costs. Extreme weather in many parts of the world has contributed to inflation. Global oil supplies took a hit from hurricanes Ida and Nicholas passing through the Gulf of Mexico and damaging US oil infrastructure. And problems meeting the demand for microchips were worsened after a fierce winter storm closed major factories in Texas last year. The cost of coffee has also jumped after Brazil, the world's largest producer, had a poor harvest following its most severe drought in almost a century. More costly imports are also contributing to higher prices. New post-Brexit trading rules are estimated to have reduced imports from the EU to the UK by about a quarter in the first half of 2021. Roaming charges are returning for many UK travellers visiting Europe this year. Separately, US import tariffs on Chinese goods have almost entirely been passed on to US customers in the form of higher prices. Chinese telecoms giant Huawei said last year that sanctions imposed on the company by the US in 2019, were affecting US suppliers and global customers. Governments worldwide are unwinding support given businesses to help with the impact of coronavirus. Public spending and borrowing increased across the world during the pandemic. This led to tax rises that have contributed to the cost-of-living squeeze, while most people's wages remain unchanged. Many developed economies have had policies designed to protect workers - such as furlough - and welfare policies to protect the lowest paid. Some economists suggest these policies could also push inflation higher as the support measures draw to a close. ",

            "content": "The company behind retailer Primark and drinks Ovaltine and Twinings is cutting jobs and raising some prices as inflation pushes up its costs. AB Foods (ABF) said it would cut 400 jobs at Primark as part of a drive to simplify the management structure. The group, which has ingredients and agriculture arms, said higher energy and transport cost may push up prices. Despite inflation pressures and Omicron hitting Primark sales, ABF said the group had seen stronger trading. The company said the Primark job changes aimed to \"provide clearer accountability, greater flexibility and more management support on the shop floor\". Primark, which employs 29,000 staff in total across 191 stores in the UK, said it would be consulting with staff over the next couple of months. Kari Rodgers, Primark retail director for the UK, said: \"The changes we're proposing will deliver a simplified and more consistent management structure across all of our stores, provide more opportunities for career progression and offer greater flexibility. \"We are now focused on supporting our colleagues who are affected by these proposed changes and will be going through the consultation process.\" Details of the job cut plans came as Primark revealed it had seen a hit to recent trading as the Omicron variant of coronavirus kept shoppers away from stores. The group said Primark's UK like-for-like sales were 10% lower in the 16 weeks to 8 January when compared with pre-pandemic levels two years ago, with shopper footfall hit by the rapid rise in Omicron cases. But ABF said shopper numbers and trading had since improved as Omicron fears ease and added that like-for-like sales were higher when compared with a year earlier, when stores were shut due to lockdown measures. Total group-wide sales at Primark, which does not have an online operation, were 36% ahead year-on-year, it added. ABF's said supply chain problems had begun to ease since last autumn, although it is still seeing some delays at ports and with shipments. The company said: \"In our grocery, sugar, ingredients and agriculture businesses we have seen an escalation in the cost of energy, logistics and commodities. \"We have been implementing plans to offset these through operational cost savings and, where necessary, the implementation of price increases.\" However, despite inflationary pressures, Primark will not raise prices for its spring/summer range, ABF's finance chief told reporters. \"Primark prices for the consumer will remain where they are,\" John Bason said. \"It's locked and loaded.\" Other retailers have signalled prices increases, including Superdry. Boss Julian Dunkerton said that prices will increase by about 2% due to rising costs. But he said Superdry will also be able to offset some cost hikes by slashing the number of items the retailer has on sale, something that has been part of the Superdry plan since before Covid-19. \"No stores will ever have a sale again,\" he told the PA news agency, and \"discounting is limited to a shorter period online and very limited\". Rival Next has flagged price rises of 3.7% in the first half of 2022 and 6% in the second half due to higher freight rates and increased manufacturing costs. Marks & Spencer has also indicated price rises are possible. Laura Hoy, equity analyst at Hargreaves Lansdown, said ABF's diversified business was a safety net throughout the pandemic. \"But as things normalise all eyes are on retail for signs of a comeback,\" she said. \"Compared to last year, when store closures kept sales painfully low, revenue rose considerably. But sales at Primark have yet to make their way to pre-pandemic levels.\" ",

            "header": "Why a gas pipeline in Russia could affect your phone bill",
            "content": "When you see your mobile bill rise this year, you probably won't blame Russia for deploying 100,000 troops at its border with Ukraine. But the two events are linked by Germany's refusal to approve a new Russian gas pipeline. And we had proof of the impact on Wednesday. The Office for National Statistics revealed that UK inflation hit 5.4% in the 12 months to December, a sign that these huge geopolitical events are starting to affect our personal finances at home. And their impact emerges in an unexpected location: at the mouth of the River Medway in Kent. In the 17th century, a chain stretched across the river to defend the region against invading ships from Europe - although the county's history, as the last place in the UK to have been occupied by a foreign army, perhaps suggests the defence was not all that effective. Today, it is on the frontline of a very different type of invasion from overseas: high prices. It is the most visible entry point for a wave of inflation that has now reached a 30-year high. What does that inflation look like? Huge tankers, each carrying enough liquid natural gas to meet a third of the UK's needs for a day. This valuable cargo will be unloaded at London Thamesport and delivered to energy companies which have paid record prices for the gas, much of which was fracked in the US. In fact, one of these ships was on its way across the Pacific to China, having passed through the Panama Canal, when it was rediverted to the UK where buyers were willing to pay 25% more for its cargo. And that premium will be passed on to us, energy customers; if not now, then in April when the energy price cap is increased. So what has this got to do with the build up of Russian troops on its border with Ukraine - and how will it affect your phone bill? Well, while the UK actually sources very little of its gas from Russia, that is not the case for the EU, which gets about half of its gas from the country. Most of the rest comes from Norway and Algeria. But that gives Russia control of the market, which means it can effectively set the price that the rest of us have to pay. A new pipeline, Nord Stream 2, has been built to increase the amount of gas Russia can send to Europe. But even though construction has been completed, gas has not started to flow because that would require regulatory clearance from Germany and the EU. However, Germany has warned that it could block that approval if Russia re-invaded Ukraine, an invasion many in the international community fear Vladimir Putin may be preparing for - although Moscow denies it. Meanwhile, energy prices are continuing to rise, pushing inflation well above the Bank of England's 2% target. And by April, when the energy price cap increases, it is likely to be more than three-times higher than that target. And that will impact your phone bill. Buried in the small print of your contract is a clause that allows the network provider to increase prices in line with the old retail price index, which is already at 7.5%. And the price increases can be felt elsewhere too. Kati Ramsden runs Bare Bazaar independent food store in Ashford, 40 miles away from the mouth of the River Medway, where those cargo vessels are unloading. She has been forced to relabel a lot of the products she sells to account for the price rises from her suppliers. \"This morning I had to put up demerara sugar from 25p to 38p [per 100g] just to suck up the price increase,\" she said. Meanwhile, the cost of a bag of pasta had increased from £1.50 to nearly £2.00, she said. \"It could make a difference to a customer because their wages aren't going up,\" she said. So while these vast global currents cause sea changes abroad, the ripples are being felt much closer to home. ",

            "header": "Brewdog flouted US laws over beer imports",
            "content": "Scottish beer giant Brewdog sent multiple shipments of beer to the US, in contravention of US federal laws, a BBC investigation has found. Staff at its Ellon brewery told the BBC they were put under pressure in 2016 and 2017 to ship beer with ingredients that had not been legally approved. One US-based importer said they had been deceived by Brewdog. In a social media post on Wednesday, Brewdog CEO James Watt admitted to \"taking shortcuts\" with the process. BBC Scotland's Disclosure programme has been told that staff at the Ellon brewery in Aberdeenshire knew that two of its flagship products, Elvis Juice and Jet Black Heart, contained extracts which were not approved in the US. One former worker told the investigation: \"The pressure was enormous. 'Just make it happen', that was the culture. It was clear to us this was coming from the top - from James [Watt].\" Another said: \"We were continually told to ship beer to the USA, despite everyone knowing the beers hadn't been approved. \"Everyone was worried they'd be [fired] if they didn't do what was asked.\" The BBC has seen evidence that suggests US treasury officials from the Alcohol and Tobacco Tax and Trade Bureau (TTB) were given false information on at least five occasions during a six-month period, which meant that potentially hundreds of kegs of beer were sent with incorrect labelling - a violation of TTB laws. All beer imported to the US needs to be declared to the TTB and given an official label before being shipped. UK breweries provide the details of their beers to a US-based importer, who make the label application on the brewery's behalf. If the beer has any unusual ingredients, like flavourings or extracts, these need to be declared so that a special label, referencing the beer's formula, can be approved before it can be shipped. Each extract needs to be deemed safe for consumption in the US before an approval is granted, and this process can sometimes take months. False information provided to the TTB can be prosecuted under US perjury laws. Brewdog sources have told the BBC that the only way to have shipped Elvis Juice and Jet Black Heart to the US in that period was to not declare the extracts. Former TTB labelling specialist Battle Martin said: \"I think it's serious. There's a lot of people out there putting a lot of effort into complying with the regulations. \"There has been a deception here,\" he said. \"In my view, based on the number of products and based on the number of times this has happened, I think it warrants further investigation, because it shows a pattern.\" The claims are to be broadcast as part of a 60-minute documentary on BBC One Scotland on Monday 24 January at 19:00. The BBC wrote to Brewdog last week detailing its allegations. In a LinkedIn post on Wednesday - entitled My Biggest Mistakes As Brewdog CEO - Mr Watt said: \"We made some mistakes with the paperwork on the first few shipments [to the US] …all taxes were paid in full, but the paperwork was not always correct.\" \"In hindsight, there were oversights ... due to the fact we were trying to run a growing business on one side of the Atlantic and start a new business on the other.\" Mr Watt said the company self-reported the issue to the TTB, who told Brewdog there would be no further action taken. It is not clear if Brewdog self-reported the issue at the time, or after the BBC wrote to them. The TTB told the BBC that a three-year statute of limitations prevented any enforcement action being taken, and in any case, it would have to have been initiated against the US-based importer, who is legally responsible for the shipments. Importers face losing their import licence for serious breaches of TTB regulations. Mr Watt said Brewdog had consulted a lawyer who believed the errors made would not risk an importer's licence. Daniel Shelton, who imported one shipment for Brewdog, said he was deceived by the company. He said: \"I was misled. I had every reason to believe that they would tell the truth. \"We believed what we were told and we weren't told what was actually going on. \"They did lead somebody in my company to falsify documents. And, of course, I'm not happy about that; I don't respect that, I don't like it.\" Another importer, Massachusetts-based MHW, told the BBC: \"Our focus is to comply with all Federal and State laws and we rely on all our suppliers for whom we import to provide truthful and accurate information as to all the ingredients in their products so we can determine the required Federal compliance processes to be executed. \"Regarding the two products in question, we executed the Federal compliance based on the information provided by the supplier at the time, which we believed to be truthful and accurate.\" Disclosure: The Truth About BrewDog is on BBC One Scotland on Monday 24 January at 19:00.

            "content": "Working-from-home guidance has been lifted but the owner of one coffee shop that relies on office workers says he's still nervous about the future. \"Ask me in a month how I'm doing,\" says James Greenhalgh, the owner of Leeds-based Flamingos Coffee House. He believes it will take months before confidence comes back. Other firms are more positive about the changes in England, with one nightclub saying his customers will feel happier once Covid passes have been dropped. Advice for people to work from home if they can in England has been dropped immediately. The requirement for mandatory face coverings in public places and Covid passports will both be dropped from next Thursday. Stephen Spensley, one of the directors of Stereo nightclub in Middlesbrough, said removing the need to show a Covid pass at the door would make his customers feel more welcome. Customers had worried about the passes, sharply reducing the numbers coming to his 300-capacity club in the run-up to Christmas, Mr Spensley said. While concern about the virus had eased in January, the requirement to show proof of either vaccination or a recent negative lateral flow test was still putting some customers off, he said. \"I think our demographic of 18 to 25-year-old clients will feel a lot freer, because a lot of them are hesitant about getting the vaccine,\" Mr Spensely said. Meanwhile, Mr Greenhalgh said the reintroduction of working-from-home guidance in December had been \"a catastrophe\" for his coffee shop and \"custom went off a cliff\". December is normally his busiest trading period, and sustains the shop in the early part of the next year. \"These are normally the busiest days of the year, and there were days when we were stood around, and no-one came in,\" he said. \"It's been a disaster.\" Face mask rules and Covid passes to end in England Thousands of hospitality businesses have been hit hard by the pandemic, and Plan B restrictions helped push many into trouble, according to insolvency firm Real Business Rescue. In December, for example, more than 6,100 bars and pubs were in \"significant financial distress\" it said, more than a fifth more than in the same period last year. But some café businesses have managed to diversify. One coffee business that has expanded into e-commerce is Grind, which has eight shops in London. It started selling compostable Nespresso-compatible coffee pods before the pandemic, and business has taken off, according to founder and chief executive David Abrahamovitch. \"That side of the business was helped by Plan B,\" he says. \"If people are working at home they are more likely to drink [coffee] at home.\" He is expecting the business to have made £20m in sales for the year, and has plans to expand into the US and Europe after a cash injection of £22m, mainly from UK investor Richard Koch. Michael Kill, of the Night Time Industries Association (NTIA), said clubs in England had lost around 20% of their footfall while Covid passes were in place. The \"debilitating restrictions\" had meant queues outside clubs were longer, he said, because security staff were trying to check Covid passes on top of checking people's age ID, in low lighting. \"What we're finding when people come up is there's frustration, from the challenges around exemptions, to civil liberties, accusations of discrimination.\" Mr Kill said without question the sector would need further financial support from the government. Mr Spensely said the extra Covid pass checks had added 20% to his staffing costs because he needs twice the number of security staff at the entrance. \"Its an extra layer of bureaucracy\" said Mr Spensely \"It slows the queue right down.\" Peter Marks, chief executive of Rekom, which has 42 venues including chains Pryzm, Bar&Beyond, Eden and Fiction, said vaccine passports \"took 30% off our business\". \"I'm not as critical as you'd think of Covid passports,\" he said. \"It's better than being shut, but it definitely affected us.\" Tristan Moffat, operations director of The Piano Works, which has two late night live music venues in central London, said \"there'll be a lot of jubilation\" about Wednesday's announcement. \"We're certainly delighted about it,\" he said. While Covid passes had caused frustration among some customers, others had found them reassuring. But other aspects of the Plan B restrictions, such as working from home guidance, had taken a \"huge toll\" on the business, as mid-week trade had fallen away, he said. Industry group UK Hospitality said the removal of restrictions was \"a key milestone on the road to recovery for the sector\". \"Lifting the working from home recommendation is a particularly important move as it enables town and city centres, and the businesses that are their lifeblood, to begin their revival and recovery,\" said UK Hospitality chief executive Kate Nicholls.

Effective immediately.\" A recording of the call was shared on social media, prompting comments that sacking people this way was \"cold\", \"harsh\" and \"a horrible move\", especially in the run up to Christmas. He swiftly apologised.

A few day's later, the board said Mr Garg was \"taking time off\" after the \"regrettable events\". Mr Garg's management style had been criticised before, after the magazine Forbes obtained an email that he sent to staff last year. In it Mr Garg wrote: \"You are TOO DAMN SLOW.

YOU ARE EMBARRASSING ME.\" In the letter to staff on Tuesday, Better's board said it was adding three new leadership positions, including the role of president, a new chairman of the board and a new head of human resources. It said the firm planned workplace training to ensure a respectful work environment and would conduct a review of company culture in six months. New York-based Better.com, which aims to use technology to make the house-buying process easier, confirmed last year that it planned to float the company on the stock market.

The former president, a Republican, has called the investigation into his business practices a politically motivated witch-hunt by Ms James, who is a Democrat. She opened a civil inquiry in 2019 into claims that - before he took office - Mr Trump had inflated the value of his assets to banks when seeking loans. Mr Trump's lawyers are trying to stop Ms James from questioning the former US president and his children, and he has sued her to try to halt the probe. Ms James's civil case is separate to an ongoing criminal investigation in Manhattan into the organisation's business practices. Her latest court filing on Tuesday is the first time the allegations being levelled at the Trump Organization have been detailed with specific examples. They involve six of his properties in New York and Scotland, and the \"Trump brand\". For example, his large property in Westchester county, north of Manhattan, was valued by the Trump Organization at $291m in 2012 (£189m at the time), however an appraisal in 2016 valued it far lower, at just $56m, the court filing says. The attorney general also alleges that Mr Trump's lavish three-storey penthouse in New York's Trump Tower was valued based on a size of 30,000 sq ft (2,800 sq m), but it is in fact 10,996 sq ft. The court filing claims that at least two false statements were made to the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) - the main tax body in the US - that \"substantially overstated\" the value of two properties to get a tax break. Ms James says this is evidence that the Trump Organization \"used fraudulent or misleading asset valuations to obtain a host of economic benefits, including loans, insurance coverage, and tax deductions.\" The latest court documents are part of legal action the New York attorney general is taking against the former president, his eldest son Donald Trump Jr and his daughter Ivanka Trump to force them to testify and answer questions as part of the civil investigation. In a statement, Ms James said \"the Trumps must comply with our lawful subpoenas... because no one in this country can pick and choose if and how the law applies to them.\" The BBC is not responsible for the content of external sites.\nView original tweet on Twitter The initial summons prompted Mr Trump's lawyers to sue Ms James in an attempt to stop the investigation, accusing her of violating his constitution rights by pursuing a partisan inquiry. Ms James says she wants to question his children in particular because Donald Trump Jr helps to run the family business and has certified the company's financial statements, while Ivanka Trump \"negotiated and secured financing\" for Trump properties. She has already questioned another of Mr Trump's sons, Eric Trump, who partly took over control of the company when his father became president in 2017. Letitia James's inquiry into Donald Trump's dealings is a civil investigation, meaning it could result in a fine or lawsuit. The criminal investigation into the Trump Organization is now being run by the new Manhattan District Attorney, Alvin Bragg. He is using some of the evidence Ms James's team says it has uncovered. Trump’s taxes: Why they matter to a criminal probe\nTrump blasts NY criminal inquiry as 'witch hunt' In July, the Trump Organization and its finance chief, Allen Weisselberg, were charged over an alleged 15-year-long scheme of helping executives evade taxes by giving benefits, such as rent and school fees, that were hidden from the authorities. Lawyers for the firm and Mr Weisselberg have pleaded not guilty to tax fraud. ",

            "content": "A group of more than 100 of the world's richest people have called on governments to make them pay more tax. The group, named the Patriotic Millionaires, said the ultra-wealthy were not being forced to pay their share towards the global economic recovery from the coronavirus pandemic. \"As millionaires, we know that the current tax system is not fair,\" they said in an open letter. The signatories included Disney heiress Abigail Disney and Nick Hanauer. Mr Hanauer is a US entrepreneur and an early investor in online retail giant Amazon. \"Most of us can say that, while the world has gone through an immense amount of suffering in the last two years, we have actually seen our wealth rise during the pandemic - yet few if any of us can honestly say that we pay our fair share in taxes,\" the signatories said in the letter to the World Economic Forum. Millions become millionaires during Covid pandemic\nWealth of 10 richest men 'doubled in pandemic'\nDavos business leaders' event postponed over Omicron Earlier at the forum, which is being held virtually due to Covid rather than in its normal home at Davos, charity Oxfam said the pandemic made the world's wealthiest far richer, while also leading to more people living in poverty. Its report said lower incomes for the world's poorest contributed to the death of 21,000 people each day, but added the world's 10 richest men had more than doubled their collective fortunes since March 2020. Research by Credit Suisse has also found that in 2020, the number of millionaires increased by 5.2 million to a total of 56.1 million globally. The UK branch of Patriotic Millionaires said analysis by the Fight Inequality Alliance, the Institute for Policy Studies, Oxfam and itself found a wealth tax starting at 2% annually for those with more than $5m, 3% for people with more than $50m, and 5% for billionaires could generate $2.52 trillion a year. The group claimed taxing the UK's wealthiest 119,000 people at such rates would raise £43.71bn a year. They suggested such funds could be used to eliminate planned National Insurance tax rises to fund social care in England, pay for the salaries of 50,000 nurses and a permanent increase of Universal Credit. It said globally, $2.52tn could lift 2.3 billion people out of poverty and make enough vaccines for the world. Gemma McGough, British entrepreneur and founding member of Patriotic Millionaires, UK said: \"For all our well-being - rich and poor alike - it's time we right the wrongs of an unequal world. It's time we tax the rich.\" Ms McGough added: \"At a time when simply living will cost the average household a further £1,200 a year, our government cannot expect to be trusted if it would rather tax working people than wealthy people. \"If they do anything in the next few months, they should do this: rather than raising National Insurance, tax the rich - tax us - instead.\" In the open letter, the signatories said business and political leaders were \"not going to find the answer in a private forum\" and were \"part of the problem\".

            "content": "A woman was unfairly dismissed from her job after her male employer shouted that \"she must be on her menopause\". Leigh Best, 54, was dismissed as a sales assistant for pet food retailer Embark on Raw, based near Billericay, Essex, for raising Covid-19 safety concerns, an employment tribunal found. The panel found Mrs Best was harassed due to her age and sex. A hearing to decide what remedy she is entitled to will take place on 31 January. The tribunal at East London Hearing Centre heard Mrs Best was employed by the company, which sells raw food for cats and dogs, from 29 January 2020 until 11 May that year. David and Andrea Fletcher, the firm's husband and wife co-directors, said she was dismissed due to her \"rude and confrontational communication with co-workers and managers\". But the tribunal panel found the principal reason was her whistleblowing during the early part of the Covid-19 pandemic, and that her dismissal took place with \"little or no respect for a fair process or the rules of natural justice\". It heard the company made efforts to be Covid-safe, but Mrs Best claimed these procedures were not actually implemented and enforced and that co-workers were not wearing face coverings and failing to follow social distancing rules. When she raised her concerns, she was told to be \"realistic and not paranoid\" but there was no documented investigation of her claims. Her employers said she had \"created a bit of a divide\" in the business, and she was given a verbal warning, but the panel found this was not confirmed in writing or correctly recorded. The panel heard Mr Fletcher made inappropriate and derogatory comments to Mrs Best about her age and sex, but found her claim he had said her husband would start looking \"at other younger women now\" was not proven. It was satisfied, however, that Mr Fletcher had shouted that \"she must be on her menopause\" on 20 March 2020 during an argument about a mix-up with orders. On another occasion, when a customer in the shop talked about a \"hot flush\", Mrs Best said \"I don't even want to hear about it… I don't want to know\", but the panel said Mr Fletcher pursued the topic. The action \"had the effect of violating [Mrs Best's] dignity and of creating a humiliating environment for her at work.\" The panel concluded \"Mr Fletcher invaded the claimant's privacy, broached a highly sensitive topic for her and acted tactlessly.\" The panel found Mrs Best was less favourably treated after raising safety concerns and agreed that her employer \"clearly had an issue\" from that point, and that she also \"added to their frustrations\" by raising the issue of Mr Fletcher's comments on her age and sex.

            "content": "The price of oil hit its highest level in more than seven years on Tuesday as traders worried that an attack on a fuel storage facility in the Middle East could affect supply. A suspected drone attack by Yemeni Houthi rebels in the United Arab Emirates blew up three fuel tankers. Three people were killed in the attack on Monday near Abu Dhabi airport. A Saudi-led coalition retaliated with airstrikes on the Yemini capital of Sanaa, killing as many as 20 people. The surging price of oil is also thought to be partly down to growing optimism for a speedy global economic recovery from the coronavirus pandemic, which would increase demand for the fossil fuel. Concern about the attacks on the oil-rich state, twinned with expectations for a surge in demand, sent prices to their highest level since October 2014. Brent crude, which is the international benchmark for oil prices, rose almost 1% to hit $87.22 a barrel. Price rises were even steeper in the US, where West Texas Intermediate crude increased by 1.3% to $84.89 a barrel. And there are already concerns that increases in the cost of oil could further contribute to a cost-of-living squeeze. \"Traders are eyeing the $100 per barrel mark for crude oil for the first time since 2014, with the perceived diminishing threat posed by Omicron to the global economy and supply constraints and disruption driving the black stuff higher,\" said AJ Bell's investment director Russ Mould. \"A rise in oil prices to a seven-year high and a continuing, though below inflation, rise in UK earnings has put the spotlight once again on inflationary pressures and a cost of living crisis,\" he added. Mr Mould's comments followed news from the Office for National Statistics that the cost of living in the UK was increasing faster than salary rises, leaving people feeling poorer. ",

            "content": "Together Energy is the latest supplier to cease trading amid the surge in gas prices, the regulator Ofgem has said. Together Energy Retail, which has about 176,000 domestic customers, was part-owned by Warrington Borough Council. The council, which spent £18m on a 50% stake in the firm in 2019, said it was \"disappointed\" the firm had gone under, but defended its investment decision. Ofgem said a new supplier would be found for the company's customers and that energy supply would continue. A total of 28 energy suppliers, mostly smaller firms, have stopped trading in the UK since August, affecting millions of customers. In a statement on its website, Together Energy said the \"sustained increase in wholesale prices and the securities required to continue to forward purchase the energy\", made the firm's situation \"untenable\". The rise in global wholesale gas prices has made price promises from many suppliers to customers undeliverable. Why are gas prices so high?\nWhat can I do if my energy supplier goes bust?\nCouncil-backed company delays £12.4m Ofgem payment Ofgem said customers of Together Energy would be contacted by a new firm once it has been selected. Households have been advised to wait until a new supplier is appointed before thinking about switching company. Neil Lawrence, director of retail at Ofgem, said the regulator's \"number one priority is to protect customers\". \"I want to reassure affected customers that they do not need to worry, under our safety net we'll make sure your energy supplies continue.\" Following Warrington Borough Council's initial £18m investment in Together Energy, the authority later lent it a further £20m. The council said its \"vision\" was to be \"part of a company that tackles the climate emergency by delivering 100% green energy to customers, contributes to reducing fuel poverty and provides local jobs in Warrington\". It claimed its \"approach to hedging\" was \"extremely robust\" and added the \"enormous and sustained wholesale price rises\" had led to the company ceasing trade. \"While it is our absolute priority to minimise any and all exposures we have as a council, we must first, as a priority, ensure that the independent administration process completes in a timely manner,\" the council said. Andy Carter, Conservative MP for Warrington South, criticised the council who he said \"simply should not have made this investment decision\" \"Having highlighted this risky investment many times in Parliament over the last two years it was only a matter of time before the inevitable happened,\" he said. \"Labour's line will be to blame everyone else but it is clear this decision was taken by Labour councillors and they must be held to account for the losses which will inevitably follow.\" Mr Carter said he had met ministers and would attempt to \"recover as much of the £52m public money invested in this business\". The collapse of Together Energy may feel like a repeat of a regular story of recent months - a small supplier unable to cope with the pressures of global wholesale gas prices. It is not. It has an extra twist because local taxpayers' money is involved. This is an uncomfortable place to be for the local authority, especially as it had previously acquired another council-owned supplier, Bristol Energy. Robin Hood Energy, funded by Nottingham City Council, closed down and its customers were transferred to British Gas in 2020. All these councils hoped their projects would tackle fuel poverty. Their intentions, however well intentioned, failed. To rub salt into the wounds, the current crisis is going mean a lot more people become fuel poor. Household and businesses have seen their energy bills rise in recent months as energy suppliers pass on a sharp rise in wholesale gas prices. Increased oil and gas demand in Asia, a rapid recovery of some economies after lockdown, and a summer with little wind to generate alternative power, have all contributed to rising energy costs. Another problem is that much of the UK's housing stock is ageing and poor at retaining heat, leaving residents particularly exposed to jumps in gas prices. Trade body Energy UK has predicted bills will surge by up to 50% in April, when the change to the price cap, due to be determined in February, kicks in. It said the average household could end up paying about £700 more per year. That, along with UK inflation at a 10-year high and expected to increase further, has prompted warnings of a cost-of-living \"crisis\". Customers will still continue to receive gas or electricity even if the energy supplier goes bust. Ofgem will move your account to a new supplier, but it may take a few weeks. Your new supplier should then contact you to explain what is happening with your account\nWhile you wait to hear from your new supplier: check your current balance and - if possible - download any bills; take a photo of your meter reading\nIf you pay by direct debit, there is no need to cancel it straight away, Citizens Advice says. Wait until your new account is set up before you cancel it\nIf you are in credit, your money is protected and you'll be paid back.

            "content": "New laws will be passed to deal with misleading crypto-asset promotions, the Treasury has announced. Although 2.3 million people in the UK own a crypto-asset, the government is worried some consumers may not understand what they are buying. Crypto-assets such as Bitcoin are largely unregulated and investors lack many protections. The same is true of non-fungible tokens - but these will not be covered by the new rules. The government plans to legislate so \"qualifying crypto-assets\" will be subject to Financial Conduct Authority (FCA) rules in the same way as other financial promotions, such as for stocks, shares, and insurance products. A 2018 report by the Crypto-assets Taskforce - which includes the Treasury, Bank of England and FCA - found crypto advertising could often overstate benefits and rarely warned of the risk consumers could lose their investment. Later work by the FCA suggested public understanding of crypto-assets was declining even as more people invested. Chancellor Rishi Sunak said the new rules would ensure consumers are protected, \"while also supporting innovation of the crypto-asset market\". \"Crypto-assets can provide exciting new opportunities, offering people new ways to transact and invest - but it's important that consumers are not being sold products with misleading claims\" he said. The government says it is still drafting a definition of the crypto-assets that will fall under the new rules. But it will not include non-fungible tokens. NFT's are often used as a form of digital receipt as well as a way of trading digital art or \"collectibles\". Some of the most valuable trade for millions of pounds. And the government acknowledged many were traded as a type of financial speculation. But it said: \"New types of non-fungible tokens have emerged which blur the boundary between financial-services products and digital collector items.\" And it was \"not the the government's intention to apply financial-promotions regulation to non-financial products\". However, the Treasury said it would closely monitor the situation. The FCA is not the only watchdog concerned about crypto advertisements. The Advertising Standards Authority says monitoring crypto-assets such as Bitcoin is a \"red-alert priority\", following concerns many ads fail to fully convey the risks of investing. It has banned numerous promotions for crypto-assets, including from a pizza chain and a football club, and is working towards new guidelines for advertisers. Internationally, regulators are also taking action. The Spanish National Securities Market Commission has announced new rules for advertising crypto-assets, including promotions by social-media influencers, Reuters reports. ",

Phoenix Group, which owns Standard Life, said this was not because people's enthusiasm waned with age. Instead, older workers often ruled themselves out of applying if they felt unwanted, it said. It comes as firms scramble for workers with job vacancies at record highs. Phoenix said it wanted to take an inclusive approach in its recruitment, as first reported by The Telegraph - but it denied that it was banning certain words from job adverts. It said it wanted to replace words such as \"innovative\" in job ads to try to avoid discouraging older applicants. Instead it will say it is looking for competencies such as \"contributing new ideas\" or \"problem solving\". Phoenix Group chief executive Andy Briggs, who is the government's \"business champion\" for older workers, warned in February 2021 that some workers had been disproportionately hit by the pandemic. The insurer employs more than 7,000 people in the UK and is currently advertising 83 vacancies. The percentage of Phoenix employees aged 45 or over is 44%. The employment rate for people aged between 50 and 64 has been increasing steadily since the mid-1990s, and in April to June 2021 stood at 71.2%, according to official figures. However, that increase has lagged behind younger age groups in the pandemic. Job vacancies in the UK have been running at record highs, and between October and December hit 1.24 million.

            "content": "Microsoft says it plans to buy major games company Activision Blizzard in a deal worth $68.7bn (£50.57bn). It would be the biggest acquisition in the company's history and is expected to be finalised in 2023. The move means Microsoft will take ownership of gaming franchises like Call of Duty, Warcraft and Overwatch. Microsoft claims it will help them grow their gaming business across mobile, PC and consoles along with providing building blocks for the metaverse. This deal is the biggest in gaming history and comes a year after Microsoft bought another influential gaming company Bethesda for $7.5bn. Satya Nadella, chairman and CEO of Microsoft said: \"We're investing deeply in world-class content, community and the cloud to usher in a new era of gaming that puts players and creators first and makes gaming safe, inclusive and accessible to all.\" Activision Blizzard has studios around the world with nearly 10,000 employees. It has been dealing with accusations of a toxic work-place culture and claims of sexual harassment in recent months. Last year Phil Spencer, the boss of Xbox, said he was 'deeply troubled' by the claims. The games Activision Blizzard make, from Call of Duty to Candy Crush, are some of the most popular in the world. The company has nearly 400 million monthly active players in 190 countries and billion-dollar franchises. Microsoft say they are working to bring Activision Blizzard games to their Game Pass subscription service. The deal has shocked the gaming industry. The BBC is not responsible for the content of external sites.\nView original tweet on Twitter In an era of increased competition, content is king. Currently it's reported that the PlayStation 5 is outselling Microsoft's latest generation of consoles. It's argued by some that this is down to the fact that in recent years Sony's machines have had more appealing exclusive titles - games that can't be played on a variety of devices. In the battle to attract more gamers to their platforms these exclusive titles and experiences are crucial. It is not yet clear if Activision Blizzard games, which at the moment can be played on both Microsoft and Sony consoles, will become exclusive to Xbox. However, with Xbox convinced that a Netflix-style gaming subscription could be the future of gaming, being able to offer more content linked to these major titles on their service will be a big bonus. They are clearly excited about what the acquisition means for their Game Pass Service, with Spencer saying they \"will offer as many Activision Blizzard games as we can within Xbox Game Pass and PC Game Pass, both new titles and games from Activision Blizzard's catalogue.\" When Microsoft bought games studio Bethesda in 2021, it was thought the developer of franchises like Fallout and Skyrim would continue to make games for other platforms. Now their big upcoming release Starfield will be a Microsoft exclusive. Spencer has explained in a blog post that until the deal is finalised, Activision Blizzard and Microsoft Gaming will operate independently. Bobby Kotick will remain as the CEO of Activision. Once the deal is complete, the Activision Blizzard business will report to Microsoft.

            "content": "The UK is facing an acute shortage of workers with digital skills - computer coders, cybersecurity experts and data analysts, are all in high demand. And it's not just a problem for the UK: globally, two-thirds of technology firms are experiencing a shortage of skilled workers, according to a recent report by recruitment firm Harvey Nash. Its survey of 2,100 firms also showed that the proportion of women that make up technology teams has only been creeping very slowly higher - standing at only 25%, while just 12% of top technology executives are women. So, given such startling statistics I decided to find out how easy it would be for a woman in her 30s, to learn to code in Python. In case you are wondering, Python is a powerful, general purpose coding language and often the first language taught to undergraduates on computer science courses. It is widely used in business - YouTube, for example, is largely written in Python. At the moment, if you want to learn to code, you need to pay for a class, teach yourself using online resources, or find a community willing to show you the ropes for free. I thought I might have a bit of a head start here, having taught myself languages used to build websites back in the early 2000s. So, I assumed I would be able to teach myself Python. The first place I started was children's computing toys, hoping the goal of making robots move would keep me engaged and motivated. UK 'heading towards a digital skills disaster'\nLearning to code 'will seriously change your life' But I quickly realised I was out of my depth - I had no idea how to use the software that came with the toys. So, switching tactics I tried Code Academy, a popular online platform, which is free. However, I found this intimidating. I was presented with an empty black prompt window that just said, \"Type Hello World\". To help me learn, I attended Teach the Nation to Code, a free one-day Python coding workshop run by UK training firm, QA. The course, which runs on Saturdays, was created by Shafeeq Muhammad, the principal technologist at QA, who credits learning to code with transforming his life. The adult class was challenging - you had to really want to learn to code in order to stay engaged. If you make mistakes in your code, it just doesn't do anything. But when it works, there's not much pay-off - just some lines on a screen. I also took classes with Cypher Coders and Creator Academy to teach me Scratch - a coding language for children with a simple visual interface. Scratch can be used to create games, animations or even program robots. More technology of business: Controversy over wood pellets as a green energy source\nThe companies offering delivery to the Moon\nIs there a better way to make new resolutions stick?\nThe African nation aiming to be a hydrogen superpower\nTech trends 2022: Starship and missing chips The children's classes were much more fun, with exciting goals like building a video game or an interactive pet, but there wasn't much theory. I also found the step change from learning Scratch to Python similarly jarring in the children's toys - you suddenly go from colourful blocks to an empty screen with no handholding. So, what could help bridge this gap from fun games for kids, to more professional level complex coding? Garry Law, founder of Australian coding training firm, Creator Academy, says IT education needs to be better. \"We need to teach kids coding with visual, auditory and kinesthetic learning styles, and we need to adapt this learning method for adults, to attract more people to science, technology, engineering and mathematics (STEM),\" he says. Cypher Coders boss, Elizabeth Tweedale, goes even further. She believes that men and women often have different learning styles and coding education needs to reflect that. She says men often follow a linear approach of going from A to Z when solving problems, while women often start from the problem and work backwards. \"We need to reinvent technology and coding environments [with] user interfaces to draw women in,\" she says. Cost is also a big problem. According to Anna Brailsford, chief executive of social enterprise Code First: Girls (CFG), it typically costs £10,000 to learn coding and often there isn't a clear link between what is taught and the jobs available. \"Women are more likely to give up unless there's a clear career pathway,\" she says. CFG gives women 13 weeks of intensive training and relates computer programming to people's interests, so they learn key skills useful on the job. CFG then places participants in tech careers based on their strengths. Back at Creator Academy, girls now make up 40% of Mr Law's classes, in part because of an initiative set up by New South Wales, which gives parents AUD$100 (£54.45) a year, to spend on tech-related classes for kids. Ms Tweedale suggests having highly-publicised hackathons with exciting prizes like money or internships with tech giants. Beverley Newing, 28, a web developer at the Ministry of Justice, agrees the way we teach science and technology needs to change. Mx Newing had hoped to study physics at university but failed to get the grades. \"I struggled a lot in the male-dominated maths classes during my International Baccalaureate,\" they tell the BBC. \"I didn't fit in and I struggled to approach the teacher when I didn't understand.\" Broke and on benefits with a literature degree, Mx Newing decided to learn to code. It was tough, as they couldn't afford classes and had to learn quickly to keep an internship. Mx Newing credits CFG and charity, Codebar's, support in providing a community as being instrumental to them being able to turn their life around. \"I'm not sure what would have happened if I hadn't got that internship,\" they say. \"I think there's an inclusion problem and we need more paid internships in the industry so you can go and do it while still paying the bills.\" ",

            "header": "Covid: Suffolk businesses welcome changes to isolation rules",
            "content": "The self-isolation period for people who test positive for Covid-19 has been cut to five full days in England. What does this mean for businesses and educational settings, and is it a good thing? Last month the isolation period was cut from 10 days to seven. From today, the minimum isolation period is reduced to five days, providing people test negative on both day five and the start of day six. At the Oaks Nursery in Felixstowe they have had as many as one in six staff off self-isolating, making day-to-day planning of rotas difficult. Manager Vicky Harvey says every day is a \"struggle\". \"It's been hard. We're having to look at numbers and staffing and if you have staff calling in sick, I need to phone around other nurseries to find out if they have got spare stuff. We have to juggle it every day,\" she says. UK train services cut due to Covid staff absences\nNHS under extreme pressure, medical boss says\nIkea cuts sick pay for some unvaccinated staff She says they have 60 staff and as well as having the team numbers whittled down due to Covid \"you have to deep clean the nursery to protect everyone as best you can\". Ms Harvey hopes the reduced isolation period will help. \"I don't have to worry about covering a 10-day period, just a five- or six-day period instead,\" she says. \"I can work out when my staff have to isolate from to when they can come back and then it means I've got less cover to try to find. \"Most staff have had it but there's no guarantee they're not going to get it again. It's a daily struggle with having to cover everything.\" The number of staff self-isolating at Alpha Nurseries Limited, which owns 12 nurseries in Suffolk, including Oaks Nursery, has proved \"challenging\", to the point where it had to close one of the nurseries due to a lack of staff. Although it welcomes the reduction in the days people have to self-isolate, it says it will still not be straightforward. Cathryn Dickens, from Alpha Nurseries, says: \"It's been quite a challenge in terms of having those phone calls over a weekend and trying to source those staff members to replace them, while keeping within our legal requirements. \"It's great that it's reduced down to five days, however the unpredictability of those staff members testing negative, it's that reliance on those two negative tests.\" She says before they open in the morning, they need to ensure staff are available \"so we cannot rely on staff having those negative tests; we need to put staffing plans into place to ensure we can accept the children coming in\". Bistro on the Quay in Ipswich says self-isolation rules over Christmas led to cancelled bookings and a 50% loss in revenue. But owner Julien Jourdain welcomes the changes to the guidance and says he is feeling \"confident\" of better times ahead. \"We definitely see confidence in customers coming back. On Saturday, for example, we were fully booked and there was a nice buzz in the restaurant,\" he says. \"I'm very confident, I do believe we are going to beat this thing and we are going to have a very good spring.\" Find BBC News: East of England on Facebook, Instagram and Twitter.

            "header": "Cladding crisis: Norwegian wealth fund urged to pressure firms and builders",
            "content": "Campaigners have urged Norway's giant state investment fund to pressure cladding firms and builders to fix fire safety issues. Grenfell survivors and leaseholders affected by the cladding crisis called on Norges Bank to pull £5.7bn of funds from companies if they fail to do so. Lucy Brown-Cortes of the End Our Cladding Scandal campaign said pressure from shareholders was \"overdue\". Norges said it had raised product safety with several of the companies. The cladding crisis has left many people with huge bills to fix unsafe homes. After the Grenfell fire, which killed 72 people in 2017, flammable cladding and other fire safety defects were discovered in hundreds of blocks of flats across the UK. Removing cladding can cost millions of pounds per block. The cost has often been passed on to flat owners under the leasehold system in England and Wales. Many leaseholders have also seen sharply increasing service charges, and some have had to pay for so-called \"waking watch\" fire wardens. Will flat owners be refunded for cladding costs?\nUnsafe cladding firms ordered to pay to fix homes\nDangerous cladding: I feel 'trapped and helpless' A letter was sent to the boss of Norges Bank Investment Management (NBIM) demanding action on Friday, as first reported by the Sunday Times. Its signatories include End Our Cladding Scandal, UK Cladding Action Group, Grenfell United, Action for Fire Safety Justice, the National Leasehold Campaign, Leasehold Knowledge Partnership and Tory MP Sir Peter Bottomley. \"This crisis has meant that at least 3,000,000 leaseholders are trapped in flammable flats they cannot sell, they are financing interim fire safety costs that they cannot afford to pay, and facing repossession/forfeiture over life-changing bills to make homes safe,\" the letter says. Nicolai Tangen, the chief executive of NBIM, should \"leverage its position as major shareholder\", it says, to push 11 firms to fix safety issues and provide compensation to victims of the Grenfell fire. NBIM should \"divest its holdings in these firms if they fail to do so\", the letter adds. The fund is an investor in three companies that were involved in producing materials used on Grenfell Tower: Kingspan, Arconic and Saint-Gobain. NBIM also has stakes in different housebuilders, as pointed out by the campaigners, such as Barratt, Bellway, Berkeley, Crest Nicholson, LendLease, Persimmon, Taylor Wimpey and Vistry. Ms Brown-Cortes told the BBC that campaigners wanted to see NBIM \"live up to their environmental, social and governance (ESG) credentials and leverage their position\" as a major shareholder in some property developers. The biggest sovereign wealth fund in the world promotes itself as a \"responsible\" investor in more than 9,000 companies globally. It has previously cut tobacco companies from its portfolio, for example. In its response to the campaigners, NBIM said it had \"raised product safety with several of the companies mentioned in your letter\" and it was a topic it would continue to monitor. NBIM added: \"In accordance with the Fund's Ethical Guidelines, companies may be put under observation or be excluded if there is an unacceptable risk that the company contributes to or is responsible for serious or systemic violations of human rights. \"The independent Council on Ethics is responsible for assessing whether our investments are inconsistent with these guidelines. In line with our procedures, we have shared the information you have provided us with the Council of Ethics.\" Housing Secretary Michael Gove backed the campaigners' \"call to action\" on Sunday. \"Developers and cladding companies who caused these problems must pay to fix them. We want these companies to do the right thing and help end this scandal,\" he said. It was confirmed last week that firms would be given until March to agree how to help leaseholders trapped in \"unsellable homes\". Mr Gove warned those who had mis-sold unsafe cladding or cut corners on homes that the government was \"coming for you\". Residents in blocks 11-18m high had been ineligible for government support to remove unsafe cladding, but the Housing Secretary said earlier this week that the government was scrapping \"the proposal for loans and long-term debt for medium rise leaseholders\". Mr Gove said some building companies had shown leadership and covered the costs but others \"had not shouldered their responsibilities.\" ",

            "header": "Credit Suisse boss Horta-Osorio resigns over Covid breaches",
            "content": "The chairman of global banking giant Credit Suisse, Antonio Horta-Osorio, has resigned with immediate effect after breaking Covid quarantine rules. Mr Horta-Osorio, who was with the bank for just nine months, left following an internal investigation. The former boss of Lloyds Banking Group joined Credit Suisse after a series of scandals at the Swiss bank. But it has emerged he breached Covid rules last year, including by attending the Wimbledon tennis finals. \"I regret that a number of my personal actions have led to difficulties for the bank and compromised my ability to represent the bank internally and externally,\" Mr Horta-Osorio said in a statement issued by the bank. \"I therefore believe that my resignation is in the interest of the bank and its stakeholders at this crucial time,\" he added. Mr Horta-Osorio has been replaced by board member Axel Lehmann. Last month, a preliminary investigation by Credit Suisse had found that Mr Horta-Osorio had breached Covid-19 rules. He attended the Wimbledon tennis finals in July at a time when the UK's Covid-19 restrictions required him to be in quarantine. Mr Horta-Osorio also breached Swiss Covid restrictions when, according to Reuters, he flew into the country on 28 November but left on 1 December. Swiss rules meant he should have quarantined for 10 days upon his arrival. Mr Horta-Osorio joined Credit Suisse in April last year following a series of scandals at the bank, In February 2020, then-Credit Suisse chief executive Tidjane Thiam resigned after it was revealed the bank had spied on senior employees. Mr Thiam denied knowledge of the spying operations. Credit Suisse has also been hit with huge losses in connection with the failed financial firm Greensill - which backed Liberty Steel - and Archegos, the US hedge fund which collapsed last year. Last year, in a report into its relationship with Archegos, Mr Horta-Osorio said: \"We are committed to developing a culture of personal responsibility and accountability.\" There are two narratives emerging from Antonio Horta-Osorio's short-lived tenure at the top of one of Swiss banking giants. One is that he broke the rules, was investigated and, having been found in breach, was asked to step down. But allies of the former boss of Lloyds Banking Group insist that the board of Credit Suisse could have censured him rather than forced him out and suggest that the Swiss bank had not appreciated his efforts to reform an executive team and a culture that has been hit a series of scandals in recent years. Credit Suisse clients lost billions after the bank funnelled them into financial products designed by the collapsed Greensill Capital while the bank itself took a multi-billion hit from the collapse of hedge fund Archegos. The bank also found itself at the centre of an unusual spying scandal which saw the departure of chief executive Tidjane Thiam. Ironically, the man Credit Suisse brought in to bring an end to a string of negative headlines is the subject of them this morning. Justin Tang, head of Asian research at investment firm United First Partners, said Credit Suisse \"has been in the 'damaged goods' section for a while now\". \"While Horta-Osorio was responsible for the new strategy, his short tenure means that the revamp is likely to only be in the nascent stage. The irony of it is that Horta was hired to fix the reputational damage to Credit Suisse and revamp its risk taking culture in the bank.\" In his statement, Mr Horta-Osorio said: \"I am proud of what we have achieved together in my short time at the bank.\" But George Godber, fund manager at Polar Capital, told the BBC: \"Only [nine] months in is not really time to achieve much. \"He was brought in to turn around the business - it is a bank that has been hit by scandal - and so it means that his reign has been cut short. \"Not everybody is above the law for Covid restrictions.\" Mr Horta-Osorio was chief executive at Lloyds Banking Group for 10 years, the start of which was marked by a surprise two month leave of absence to deal with severe sleep deprivation. Later on, amid media reports of an extra-marital affair, Mr Horta-Osorio emailed Lloyds staff, saying: \"I deeply regret being the cause of so much adverse publicity and the damage that has been done to the group's reputation. \"I have been a strong advocate of expecting the highest professional standards from everyone at the bank, and that includes me.\" Speaking to the BBC, a spokesperson for Credit Suisse said that the bank would give no further details on Mr Horta-Osorio's resignation other than those in its statement. They also said that there were no plans to release the findings of the investigation. ",

            "content": "Amazon has dropped plans to block UK Visa credit card payments this week, as the two sides continue to try to resolve a dispute over payment fees. \"The expected  change regarding  the use of  Visa credit cards on Amazon.co.uk will no longer take place on January 19,\" Amazon said. Visa said it was \"working closely to reach an agreement\". Amazon said last year that Visa payment costs were \"an obstacle\" to providing the best prices for customers. But Visa accused Amazon of threatening to restrict consumer choice. \"When consumer choice is limited, nobody wins,\" Visa said. Neither company has indicated when the talks might conclude. In an email to customers on Monday, Amazon said it was working closely with Visa on \"a potential solution that will enable customers to continue using their Visa credit cards on Amazon.co.uk\". An EU-enforced cap on fees charged by card issuers is no longer in place in the UK following Brexit. Both Visa and its rival Mastercard have raised the so-called interchange fee on cross-border transactions between businesses in the UK and the European Union following Brexit. However, Amazon and Visa said last year that their dispute had nothing to do with the UK leaving the EU. They have been slugging it out in public and in private, now these two corporate heavyweights are going in for an extra round. Amazon is ahead on points in this bout. Given this announcement has come so close to the deadline, many customers would have already switched their primary Amazon payment method away from Visa. But the online retailer would also have been hurt financially if it had followed through on its threat. The cancelling of the deadline, and the fact a new end date has not been set, suggests a deal is near. Neither Amazon nor Visa are saying much to be able to judge quite how close they are to a compromise. This dispute is about more than just fees. It is also about control. Don't forget that Amazon has taken a different course with Mastercard, which is behind Amazon's reward card. Amazon has previously declined to say how much Visa charges the retailer to process transactions made on credit cards. Visa also declined to comment, though it claimed that on average it takes less than 0.1% of the value of a purchase. The Payment Systems Regulator has raised concerns about competition in this sector, which is dominated by Visa and Mastercard. In a strategy published last week, it said one of its priorities was to promote competition between UK payment systems. \"We will focus more on improving competition between payment systems, not just competition within payment systems,\" its managing director Chris Hemsley said. \"This is important because we know that the future of retail payments is becoming increasingly about digital payments, most of which are currently made using card payment systems.\" ",

            "content": "Consumer goods giant Unilever has signalled it will continue pursuing a blockbuster deal to buy GlaxoSmithKline's (GSK) healthcare arm. Unilever has already had a £50bn offer rejected, but said on Monday a deal would be a \"strong strategic fit\". GSK's health products business owns brands such as Sensodyne toothpaste, Panadol and Centrum vitamins. Unilever, maker of Marmite, PG Tips and Dove soap, says it wants a bigger slice of the health and hygiene sectors. \"The acquisition would create scale and a growth platform for the combined portfolio in the US, China and India, with further opportunities in other emerging markets,\" Unilever said, pointing to synergies in the oral care and vitamin supplements business. Unilever has not said if it will sweeten its rejected offer, but according to the Bloomberg news agency the company has held talks with its banks about additional financing for a increased bid. Marmite-owner Unilever bids for GSK consumer arm GSK's share price was up almost 5% on Monday morning, a sign some investors are hopeful of a higher offer. Unilever's shares fell almost 7%. Unilever is already the third largest company on London's FTSE 100 index and is worth around £100bn. A deal would see it take over one of the biggest divisions of the FTSE 100's fifth biggest company. GSK, which runs the healthcare operation in a joint venture with US drug maker Pfizer, has already said it wants to offload the operation. However, management had proposed spinning it off as a standalone business listed on the stock market. GSK wants to concentrate on pharmaceuticals and vaccines. Some activist investors have been calling for GSK chief executive Emma Walmsley to explore a potential sale as an alternative to the spin-off. News of Unilever's interest was first reported over the weekend by the Sunday Times. That prompted the company to bring forward a strategic update, which it had planned to release later this month. Unilever said it has \"concluded that Unilever's future strategic direction lies in materially expanding its presence in health, beauty and hygiene\". It added: \"The board also concluded that major acquisitions should be accompanied by the accelerated divestment of intrinsically lower growth brands and businesses.\" It said GSK's consumer health division was \"a highly complementary\" target, with \"good potential for synergies and a number of routes to build scale\". Hargreaves Lansdown analyst Laura Hoy said there is a good chance Unilever will raise its offer. \"Based on Unilever's new strategic direction, which includes increased focus on growth in the health, beauty and hygiene segments, there could be another offer in the pipeline. \"The group says it will pounce on acquisition opportunities within the space, and they don't get much more appealing than this one.\" ",

Costs are varied across the UK, and the cheapest type of ceremony - a cremation without a service - rose in price. Last year, funeral firms were ordered to display clearer price lists for bereaved customers. At a time when prices in general have been rising at their fastest rate for years, some families have found the cost of funerals difficult to cover. \"Funerals are still relatively expensive, and half of people arranging a funeral in the last year looked for ways to keep funeral costs down - including choosing a cheaper coffin, spending less on flowers and having the wake at home,\" said Mark Screeton, chief executive of SunLife. Some were also limited in the kind of commemorations they were able to organise owing to the Covid pandemic. There was a notable increase in digital streaming of funeral services to loved ones unable to attend. Funeral firms ordered to make prices clearer\n'More and more people don't want a traditional burial' The insurer's review into funeral costs has been running for nearly two decades and this was the first year-on-year fall in the average cost of a funeral that it has recorded. However, it has predicted a return to year-on-year increases in prices in the next five years. The cost of professional fees was another driver of falling prices last year. Since September, funeral directors and crematoria operators have been required to display a standardised price list on their premises and their websites. Under orders from UK competition authorities, the list must include the headline price of a funeral, the cost of individual items that go to make up the funeral, and prices of extra products and services. The average cost of a funeral varies significantly across the country, ranging from more than £5,000 in London - where prices rose by 2.3% last year - to just over £3,000 in Northern Ireland, which was 5.2% cheaper than the previous year. The report also recorded a steep increase in the number of direct cremations, when the body is cremated without a service and the ashes are returned to the family. Some of this was driven by Covid restrictions, but it is also the cheapest type of send-off, at an average cost of £1,647. This rose in cost by 6% last year compared with the previous year. Funeral directors also reported that celebration of life services were rising in popularity, although Abide With Me remained the most common song or hymn to be played. ",

Mr Musk announced the development on Twitter on Friday, a month after hinting of the plans. The news sent the value of Dogecoin soaring, though it fell back later. Comments by Mr Musk have frequently moved the prices of digital currencies, including Dogecoin and Bitcoin. The move, which sent Dogecoin prices more than 14% higher at one point, comes a month after Mr Musk said Tesla would test out the digital token as a payment option. The BBC is not responsible for the content of external sites.\nView original tweet on Twitter Dogecoin, which was started in 2013 as a parody of the cryptocurrency craze, was once obscure. But its value climbed about 4,000% last year, driven in part by promotion from Mr Musk. An investor in the token, he has dubbed it the \"people's crypto\" and said his space company SpaceX would accept it as payment. During an appearance on the humour show Saturday Night Live, after getting pressed to define it, he called it \"a hustle\". It's not the only digital coin to receive attention from the billionaire, who has a passionate online following. Last year, Bitcoin prices jumped after Tesla said it had invested in the currency and would allow customers to buy cars with it. But the company later scrapped that idea. Mr Musk, who also counts Bitcoin among his crypto investments, cited concerns about how much energy it takes to produce the currency. Dogecoin is currently the only digital currency Tesla accepts. Items eligible for purchase include Tesla-branded belt buckles (835 Doge or about $162; £118) and children's all-terrain vehicles (12020 Doge or about $2,280; £1,670), which are currently sold out. The purchases are non-refundable, according to the firm's website. ",

            "content": "Energy supplier E.On has said it is \"incredibly sorry\" for sending socks to customers in a bid to encourage them to turn the heating down. It is the second major supplier to admit to a marketing gaffe when customers are facing a cost of living squeeze driven by energy prices. Earlier in the week, Ovo's founder said he was \"really embarrassed\" about energy saving advice including \"doing a few star jumps\" and cuddling pets. Energy bills are set to soar in April. A new price cap looks set to add about £600 to the annual gas and electricity bill of a household with typical energy usage. Energy boss blames bad day for ‘ridiculous’ advice\nE.On compensates customers after Christmas blunder The socks were sent out by E.On Next - an arm of the energy giant which sells and promotes renewable electricity. The footwear came with a message encouraging people to leave \"lighter footprints\" by turning heating down and lowering carbon emissions. However, some customers reacted with anger and perplexity - especially when they were sent to elderly relatives. Now, the company has apologised. Writing on Twitter, it said: \"If you recently received a pair of socks from us, we would like to say we are incredibly sorry for how we have made some people feel. \"In light of the seriousness of current challenges that many people are facing, this mailing should have been stopped and we are sorry.\" As first reported in the Daily Mail, the company said it sent the socks to 30,000 customers who responded to an energy saving campaign last year. In a subsequent statement, a spokesman for the company said: \"This activity was in no way designed to detract from the seriousness of the current energy crisis \"This campaign originally went ahead last year and was intended as a fun way to encourage people to think about 'lightening your carbon footprint' and isn't meant to be anything to do with the current challenges many people are facing.\" He said E.On had invested billions of pounds into better insulation, efficient heating, and advice to customers. E.On is the UK's second biggest energy supplier, after British Gas. Stephen Fitzpatrick, the founder of the third-largest, Ovo, said earlier in the week that \"someone had a bad day\" when a link was sent to customers directing them to a blog encouraging them to save energy by hugging pets. The latest gaffe comes on the day an alliance of charities called on the government for urgent action to tackle the energy bill crisis. The 25 charities, including Save the Children, Age UK, End Fuel Poverty Coalition, WWF, Green Alliance and Greenpeace, said emergency funding was needed to support the most vulnerable. ",

            "content": "The UK economy surpassed pre-Covid levels for the first time in November after recording stronger-than-expected growth. The Office for National Statistics said gross domestic product (GDP) expanded by 0.9% between October and November. That was higher than economists' expectations and meant the economy was 0.7% larger than in February 2020. But there is concern growth slowed again after the spread of Omicron and the introduction of Plan B measures. \"The economy grew strongly in the month before Omicron struck, with architects, retailers, couriers and accountants having a bumper month,\" said ONS chief economist Grant Fitzner. \"Construction also recovered from several weak months as many raw materials became easier to get hold of.\" Analysts at Capital Economics said the economy was boosted by 3.5% growth in the construction sector, adding \"the unusually dry weather probably helped\". It also said manufacturing output also improved and the professional sector also picked up, \"apparently due to architectural and engineering activities being brought forward from December\". GDP or Gross Domestic Product is one of the most important ways of showing how well, or badly, an economy is doing. It's a measure - or an attempt to measure - all the activity of companies, governments and individuals in an economy. GDP allows businesses to judge when to expand and hire more people, and for government to work out how much to tax and spend. Rising GDP means more jobs are likely to be created, and workers are more likely to get better pay rises. If GDP is falling, then the economy is shrinking - bad news for businesses and workers. The Covid pandemic caused the most severe recession seen in over 300 years, hurting business and employment, and forcing government to borrow hundreds of billions of pounds to support the economy. Read more about GDP here Economists had been expecting GDP to expand by 0.4% in November. Chancellor Rishi Sunak said the stronger growth was \"a testament to the grit and determination of the British people\". But Samuel Tombs, chief UK economist at Pantheon Macroeconomics, said: \"GDP almost certainly dropped in December, as households hunkered down in response to the Omicron variant.\" The Omicron variant emerged at the end of November and Plan B measures were introduced on 8 December. Mr Tombs said data such as restaurant diner numbers, transport usage and cinema revenues \"point to a pullback in consumer services expenditure\" last month, while \"Omicron also depressed labour supply\". However, he added: \"Omicron looks set to fade almost as quickly as it arrived, thanks partly to the rapid rollout of booster jabs. As a result, we expect the government to allow Plan B rules to automatically expire on 26 January and for GDP to bounce back in February.\" These figures show that the reopening and recovery of the UK economy was motoring just before Omicron struck. The economy had for the first time regained, on a monthly basis, all the very heavy losses during the pandemic lockdowns. Business had been returning to something approaching normality after the government's decision to axe restrictions since the summer. Monthly figures are quite volatile though and usually not provided by other countries. It is possible that the Omicron-linked hit to the economy in December could undo the impressive growth in November on the key fourth quarter figure. Using this more usual and internationally comparable quarterly basis, it is still not certain if the UK economy has recovered these losses. The bigger question is about the impact of Omicron. With hopes that the rapidly-spreading variant has peaked, economists are now confident it will have far less of a hit than previous Covid waves. Retailers' results over the festive period have been very encouraging. But the response of the public and its attitude to going out and spending is the big economic unknown. And while Omicron concern fades, the hits to disposable income from rising prices are very real. So while the chancellor called today's GDP milestone \"amazing\" it's probably not the moment for celebration. The ONS said that, on a quarterly basis, in the final three months of 2021 the UK economy will reach or surpass pre-Covid levels seen in the last quarter of 2019 if GDP grows by at least 0.2% in December and there are no downward revisions to figures for October and November. However, several economists pointed to a bumpy road for growth in the first months of this year. \"We expect growth to slow in 2022 as it will no longer be able to simply rely on the [Covid] rebound effect to propel it,\" said Yael Selfin, chief economist at KPMG UK. \"In addition, rising taxes and borrowing costs, as well as elevated inflation, will squeeze households' purchasing power, while the lingering effects of supply chain bottlenecks together with a persistent shortage of labour could constrain production this year.\" Inflation is expected to hit 6% by spring, according to the Bank of England which raised its key interest rate in December and is forecast to lift borrowing costs again this year. The government will raise the National Living Wage by 6.6% for over 23 year-olds in April but that is the same month when energy regulator Ofgem will implement the new price cap on household gas and electricity bills. Ofgem is widely expected to lift the price cap following a sharp rise in wholesale gas prices last year which forced around 20 smaller energy companies out of business. Also from April, employers, workers and the self-employed will all pay 1.25p more in the pound for National Insurance. ",

            "content": "Currys said 2021 was \"the year that virtual reality broke into the mainstream\" as the electronics retailer reported a \"challenging\" Christmas. Chief executive Alex Baldock said Oculus Quest 2 and PS5 were \"stars\" as \"consoles flew off the shelves\" in what he described as a \"gamers' Christmas\". However, the retailer said in the 10 weeks to 8 January sales in the UK and Ireland were down 6% year on year. It said the overall UK tech market was down 10% compared with Christmas 2020. Mr Baldock said the market was \"challenging\" over the festive period due to \"uneven customer demand\" and disruption to supply chains. Currys, which trades from more than 800 stores in seven countries and online, warned prior to Christmas that trading had been weakened as the Omicron Covid variant hit the UK and some restrictions were put in place. However, Mr Baldock said despite the challenges, \"Currys' colleagues showed their resilience and the stronger business we've built\". \"We gained market share, improved customer satisfaction, traded profitably, and can look ahead with confidence,\" he added. The retailer said online sales rose in UK and Ireland by 29% during the peak sales period compared with before the pandemic, while international online sales rose 79% on 2019. \"This was a gamers' Christmas, the year that virtual reality broke into the mainstream, and when consoles flew off the shelves,\" Mr Baldock added. \"Oculus Quest 2 and PS5 were stars. Appliances large and small also enjoyed strong sales, as consumers continued to kit out their homes.\" The bumper console sales came despite warnings of potential shortages, due to microchips used in the products, as well as new cars and phones, being in short supply globally. Currys said it expected to deliver a full-year adjusted pre-tax profit of about £155m, compared with £156m in 2020-21. Shares in the group, previously known as Dixons Carphone, fell by nearly 5% on Friday morning. Mr Baldock also warned that price rises were \"almost inevitable\" next year, but said Currys would maintain its pledge of being the cheapest in the market. Separately, Mr Baldock told BBC 5 Live he would not cut sick pay for staff who were not vaccinated against Covid-19, after moves by other retailers such as Next and Ikea. He said Currys' approach was \"that we encourage and we help colleagues to get vaccinated with some time off during the working day to do so\". \"I've mentioned our colleagues are more engaged, they're telling us they're happier than ever and that's because we've worked really hard through this pandemic on their health, their wellbeing, their safety, and we're going to treat them with respect,\" he added.

            "content": "Trade talks between the UK and India are now under way, with Scotch whisky on the table as one product with huge potential gains.\nExperience of failed talks with the EU point to many obstacles to cracking the world's biggest whisky market, going beyond the 150% tariff.\nScotch is only one product among many that Britain wants to export more, including finance and cars, but the compromises required with India's demands could be difficult for the UK Government. A bottle of Scotch whisky arriving in the port of Mumbai faces a colossal 150% import tariff, yet it hasn't stopped Indians from being enthusiastic drinkers of a dram. India is the world's biggest market for whisky, most of it termed \"Indian-made foreign liquor\". The big brands sound more Speyside than sub-continental: McDowell's, Royal Stag, Bagpiper, Peter Scot. Domestic distillers have lobbied fiercely and successfully to limit Scotch imports. If the bottle is sold in Mumbai or elsewhere in the state of Maharashtra, it used to carry a further 300% tariff, though that was recently halved. Among other parts of the Indian union, some don't allow alcohol sales at all, except to those who know how to get round the rules. Scotch makes up only 2% of India's market. Yet the value of Scotch whisky sales to India has risen from below £60m in 2011 to more than £150m in 2019. That has been on the soaring growth of the economy and the country's burgeoning middle class, with its drouth for prestige international products and brands. By volume, last year saw India become the third biggest market for Scotch. But as 60% of that is in bulk, for bottling in India or for blending with local spirits, that is lower value Scotch than exported to other markets. So imagine what could be sold with lower tariffs. There's a big prize from getting them removed, or at least slashed. And that puts whisky firmly on the table of the talks, which began this week, aimed at a free trade agreement between the UK and India. Oxford Economics doesn't imagine what could be sold: it models it. Commissioned by the Scotch Whisky Association, it assumes that the import tariffs come down to around 25%. With that, it estimates £1.2bn more exports within five years, and that could generate 1,300 jobs in the UK. And part of the pitch to the Indian government is that such trade liberalisation would only take Scotch from 2% to to around 6% of the nation's consumption, while boosting Delhi's government revenues by more than £3bn. That way, everyone wins. But trade liberalisation isn't that simple, particularly in India. One of the first problems is getting to an agreement on the valuation of an import consignment before it even leaves the port. That can take a very long time, and a free trade deal would have to simplify that process. The application of rules can be, let's say, unpredictable. One key part of any free trade deal would be a court of arbitration. But as Edinburgh-based Cairn Energy found (it recently rebranded as Capricorn), such existing international rules on investment can get stuck in Indian bureaucracy and legal obstacles. Having developed the country's biggest oil field and sold its stake, Cairn's attempts to reclaim at least $1bn owed by the Delhi tax authorities only began to make progress after it started action to seize the government's overseas assets. After leaving the port, imports of whisky into India then hit 30 different markets, across India's states, requiring different labelling, with different duty and retail rules. Some states have a government monopoly in retailing alcohol, which is open to abuse by those in power. Those in the distilling industry who have been trying to break down the barriers to trade have low expectations of those internal trade barriers being removed under a deal between the UK government and the federal trade ministry in Delhi. A deal between national governments would be a big breakthrough, but just the start of a new chapter in trying to crack this market. After 10 years of the European Union trying, but failing, to get a free trade deal, in which Scotch whisky also played a prominent part, there is some optimism that the mood in India has shifted. A crucial part of that is that the domestic distilling industry now has more international ownership. The flamboyant businessman Vijay Mallya, who bought Scotch distiller Whyte & Mackay to add to India's biggest distiller, United Spirits - along with his empire of brewing, a large airline, premier league cricket, a Formula 1 team and a seat in India's parliament - is out of the picture now. Living in London, the sun has set on his empire, and he is fighting extradition to his homeland to face charges of money laundering on a vast scale. Much of United Distillers is now owned by Diageo, the London-headquartered global drinks giant which happens also to own around 40% of Scotch production. So it is now a big player in Indian distilling and in Scotch, plus gin, tequila, rum and Guinness, which it would dearly love to get into the Indian market. By no coincidence, Indian distillers seem to be putting up less lobbying resistance to imports of Scotch. So could this now be the breakthrough for Scotch into the world's biggest whisky market? The UK government, with a new-ish trade secretary Anne-Marie Trevelyan, is eager to show progress post-Brexit on reaching beyond European trade to \"Global Britain\". There isn't much prospect of a breakthrough deal anywhere else. Whitehall brings inexperience to the table, while India's trade negotiators have lots of experience, much of it in refusing to compromise due to domestic politics and an under-current of belief that India can be self-sufficient. The trade talks are likely also to feature the desire of Britain's financial sector to get into the Indian market, to which it currently exports only a 10th of its sales to Japan. That would require dismantling of massively complex regulatory barriers. Its lead trade body, CityUK, wants to see fewer restrictions on data flows, and visas for British nationals to work at least temporarily in India. Having seen Cairn Energy and others snared, it is also seeking protection for investments. The car industry, including Indian-owned Jaguar Land Rover, wants to get access to wealthy customers on the sub-continent. And India has its own negotiating priorities, starting with much lower barriers for its professionals to work in the UK. Its view of world trade is the projection of the power of the Indian diaspora - a huge English-speaking pool of technical skills and entrepreneurial flair. But welcoming many more Indians into Britain could be seen as running counter to the spirit of Brexit, which was to keep foreign workers out. That would be a tricky political compromise for the UK government to sell to its supporters. It's one that the Home Secretary, Priti Patel - herself a daughter of that Indian diaspora - is reported to be firmly against. ",

            "content": "Up to 44 million UK Facebook users could share £2.3bn in damages, according to a competition expert intending to sue parent company Meta. Dr Liza Lovdahl Gormsen alleges Meta \"abused its market dominance\" to set an \"unfair price\" for free use of Facebook - UK users' personal data. She intends to bring the case to the Competition Appeal Tribunal. A Meta representative said users had \"meaningful control\" of what information they shared. Facebook \"abused its market dominance to impose unfair terms and conditions on ordinary Britons, giving it the power to exploit their personal data\", Dr Lovdahl Gormsen says. And this data, harvested between 2015 and 2019, provided a highly detailed picture of their internet use, helping the company make \"excessive profits\". Anyone living in the UK who used Facebook at least once during the period will be part of the claim unless they choose to opt out, she says. However, in November, the UK's Supreme Court rejected an optout claim seeking billions of pounds in damages from Google over alleged illegal tracking of millions of iPhones - Google said the issue had been addressed a decade ago. The judge in that case said the claimant had failed to prove damage had been caused to each individual by the data collection. But he did not rule out the possibility of future mass-action cases if damages could be calculated. And Dr Lovdahl Gormsen told BBC News: \"Optout cases are specifically permitted at the Competition Appeal Tribunal. \"As a result, my case is able to claim damages on behalf of the 44 million British Facebook users affected.\" Meta has rejected the allegations. People use its free services because they find them useful and have control over how their data us used, it says. A representative told BBC News: \"People access our service for free. \"They choose our services because we deliver value for them and they have meaningful control of what information they share on Meta's platforms and who with. \"We have invested heavily to create tools that allow them to do so.\" However, this latest case adds to the company's legal battles The US Federal Trade Commission was recently given the go-ahead to take Meta to court over anti-trust rules.

North Korea has routinely denied being involved in hack attacks attributed to them. \"From 2020 to 2021, the number of North Korean-linked hacks jumped from four to seven, and the value extracted from these hacks grew by 40%,\" Chainalysis said in a report. The hackers used a number of techniques, including phishing lures, code exploits and malware to siphon funds from the organisations' \"hot\" wallets and then moved them into North Korea-controlled addresses, the company said. Cryptocurrency hot wallets are connected to the internet and cryptocurrency network and so are vulnerable to hacking. They are used to send and receive cryptocurrency, and allow users to view how many tokens they have. Many experts recommend moving large amounts of cryptocurrency not needed day-to-day to \"cold\" wallets, which are disconnected from the wider internet. Chainalysis said it is likely that many of last year's attacks were conducted by the so-called Lazarus Group, a hacking group which the US has applied sanctions against. The group is believed to be controlled by North Korea's primary intelligence bureau, the Reconnaissance General Bureau. The Lazarus Group has previously been accused of involvement in the \"WannaCry\" ransomware attacks, the hacking of international banks and customer accounts and cyber-attacks on Sony Pictures in 2014. Massive cyber-attack hits 99 countries\nSony Pictures computer system hacked\nThe Lazarus heist: How hackers tried to steal $1bn \"Once North Korea gained custody of the funds, they began a careful laundering process to cover up and cash out,\" the report on last year's cyber attacks added. A United Nations panel that monitors sanctions on North Korea has accused Pyongyang of using stolen funds to support its nuclear and ballistic missile programmes as a way to avoid international sanctions. Separately, in February last year, the US charged three North Korean computer programmers with a massive hacking spree aimed at stealing more than $1.3bn in money and cryptocurrency. The cyber attacks affected companies from banks to Hollywood movie studios, the Department of Justice said. ",

            "content": "South Korea has increased its base rate of interest to where it was before the pandemic, as it tries to contain rising inflation and soaring household debt. The Bank of Korea's (BOK) widely expected decision to raise the rate to 1.25% was its third hike in six months. Central banks around the world are trying to balance the impact of Covid-19 measures against inflationary risks. In August, the country became the first major Asian economy to raise rates since the start of the coronavirus era. Surging inflation has ramped up pressure on South Korea's policy makers to take action, as consumer inflation for 2021 as a whole jumped to 2.5%. That was the fastest pace of price rises since 2011 and a sharper increase than projected by the BOK. Over the last two years, central banks, governments and international financial bodies have pumped trillions of dollars into the global economy to help cushion the impact of restrictions put in place to slow the spread of the coronavirus. Now, policy makers in countries around the world are starting to dismantle those emergency stimulus measures. South Korea has been at the forefront of the shift by the world's central banks to wind down the huge amount of stimulus as they aim to curb rising consumer prices. The US Federal Reserve has signalled that it plans to increase its interest rate three times this year. That comes as prices in America are rising at their fastest rate in almost 40 years, with inflation up 7% year-on-year in December. In the UK, the Bank of England raised interest rates last month for the first time in more than three years, in response to calls to tackle surging price rises. That came after official figures showed the cost of living had surged by 5.1% in the 12 months to November, the highest level for a decade. ",

            "content": "Using a company to help you claim a tax rebate could end up costing you hundreds of pounds extra according to consumer group Which? Dozens of firms online offer to help customers claim back tax they're owed by HM Revenue & Customs, for example, for the Marriage Allowance. But these third-party firms charge fees and take a percentage of the tax claim. Which? says most people are much better off going straight to HMRC themselves to avoid \"unnecessary bills\". Tax rebates are free to claim via HMRC, and the process is \"relatively simple\", but some firms are charging between a quarter and half of the final tax payment received in return for their services, Which? said. The consumer rights group has identified 208 firms with \"tax reclaim\", \"tax refund\", \"tax claim\" and \"tax rebate\" in their names. It found the term \"tax rebate\" gets more than 40,000 Google searches a month. Some of these third-party firms use similar branding and language to the HMRC, Which? said. Jenny Ross, Which? money editor, said their research showed huge numbers of people were coming into contact with firms hoping to persuade them to use their services to claim rebates, costing people \"potentially hundreds of pounds\". \"For most people with a rebate to claim, HMRC is the best port of call. Go to its website directly to ensure you aren't left footing any unnecessary bills,\" she said. HMRC waives fines again for late self-assessment\nWarning benefits will not keep up with rising prices One of the most common tax claims is for Marriage Allowance, Which? said, which allows one spouse to transfer 10% of their tax-free personal allowance to their partner if their partner earns less than the current personal allowance, and it can be backdated up to a total of £1,220. While firms are permitted to charge a \"reasonable amount\" for such services, Which? said it found one firm, Tax Credits Ltd, was charging a service fee of 48%. Tax Credits said: 'We spend a significant amount on marketing and providing access to this potential tax relief. In many cases it's our advertising, not HMRC's, that makes a person aware of it. \"We then present the claimant with a simple mechanism to access the potential overpayment of tax. Our remuneration is contingent on a repayment being secured, and the amount we retain is reflective of this,\" it added. Which? said customers who have been misled by websites into thinking they were dealing with the tax authority directly should make a complaint to the Citizens Advice Consumer Service. ",

            "content": "Ocado and Next have cut sick pay for unvaccinated staff who must self-isolate because of Covid exposure, the BBC has learned. Both retailers will continue to pay full sick pay to unvaccinated workers if they test positive for the virus. Furniture giant Ikea is also among employers making similar moves, as staff absences rise. Next said it was an \"emotive topic\" but that it had to balance staff and shareholder needs. It is unclear when Next made the change but it is believed to have been recent. Online grocer Ocado confirmed on Thursday that it had adopted the same policy as Next this week. Next currently pays store sales consultants and stock assistants between £6.55 and £9.21 an hour and warehouse operatives between £9.30 and £11.26 an hour. But unvaccinated workers who are required to isolate could now receive as little as £96.35 a week - the Statutory Sick Pay minimum - unless there are mitigating circumstances. Who needs to self-isolate now and for how long?\nIkea cuts sick pay for some unvaccinated staff\nCovid staff shortages will continue into New Year\nHow can I get my booster jab? Last month, official self-isolation guidance was relaxed for people who have been jabbed, meaning they do not need to isolate if they have been exposed to a positive case. But there was no change to the guidance for unvaccinated close contacts, who must still self-isolate for 10 full days after their date of exposure. Statutory Sick Pay (SSP) is the minimum amount employers must pay, but some employers offer more than SSP - this is normally known as company or contractual sick pay. Beth Hale, partner at employment law firm C M Murray, said claims of direct discrimination due to this kind of sick pay policy were unlikely to succeed as being opposed to vaccination was \"unlikely to be a protected belief for the purposes of the Equality Act.\" \"While the policy may have a disproportionate impact on those from certain ethnic or religious groups (which could give rise to a claim for indirect discrimination), an employer may well be able to justify the policy on the basis of their legitimate business needs,\" she added. She said where employers are struggling with significant staff absences because of the large case numbers, it \"seemed reasonable\" that they may want to take steps to encourage vaccination amongst their workforce in this way. But she added that employers need to be \"careful that policies are communicated carefully and sensitively\" to avoid employee relations issues. Many companies, including Next, faced labour shortages in 2021 and some are now are seeing mass absences due to the more infectious Omicron Covid strain. This week it emerged that Ikea, which employs about 10,000 people in the UK, had changed its policy on unvaccinated staff who have been exposed to coronavirus. Sick pay cuts will also be implemented at Wessex Water and in the US several major companies have started penalising un-jabbed workers. However, the major UK supermarkets and Amazon told the BBC their policies had not changed. Next's move comes days after it said it was putting up its prices to offset higher wage and manufacturing costs. The retailer said prices for its spring and summer clothing and homeware ranges would climb by 3.7% from a year earlier, while it expects a 6% rise for autumn and winter goods. The company forecasts full-year sales to rise by 7% overall, but it warned it could face a tougher trading environment in 2022 given the financial pressures facing households, such as higher energy bills. In October last year, Next boss Lord Wolfson said the retailer had struggled with labour shortages because workers were not available in the places needed and seasonal workers had proved difficult to recruit. The executive, who supported Brexit, said the problem could be solved by companies hiring overseas workers and paying a \"visa tax\".

            "content": "French holiday bookings have jumped after Paris said it would ease restrictions on UK travellers, travel firms have said. Airline Jet2 said it had seen a \"sharp\" rise in bookings and searches for flights to French skiing destinations. And Tour operator Tui said ski bookings doubled on Wednesday following reports the rules would change. Many UK holidaymakers had to cancel holidays when France banned all but essential travel last month. But from Friday, vaccinated Britons will no longer need a compelling reason to enter France or self-isolate when they arrive. They will only need to present a negative Covid-19 test taken 24 hours before leaving the UK. ABTA, which represents British travel agents, said the rule change was a relief for both holidaymakers and travel firms. France to relax travel rules from the UK \"Thousands of people head [to France] for ski breaks at this time of year, so this will be a huge relief for customers with holidays booked there for the next few weeks, who have been waiting anxiously for news,\" it said. It added that the French government still had to give more details on entry requirements including the rules for children. Jet2 boss Steve Heapy said the rule change was good news for the thousands of Britons who go on skiing trips to France during winter. \"This is the positive news that skiers and snowboarders have been looking forward to, and the spike in bookings for ski flights has been both sharp and immediate,\" he said. Tui, which owns tour operator Crystal Ski Holidays, said bookings had been increasing in anticipation that the rules would be relaxed. \"Bookings to France doubled yesterday even before the announcement and we would expect to see another very positive uptick now it's official,\" said Chris Logan, managing director of Crystal Ski Holidays. Diane Palumbo, sales director at independent tour operator Skiworld, said the announcement had come too late for bookings for this weekend, which had been cancelled - although many customers were keen to rebook. She said interest in the rest of the season was \"enormous\", with many people ready for a break after two years of Covid restrictions. Brittany Ferries chief executive Christophe Mathieu said the rules relaxation \"comes as a great relief\", adding that \"businesses in the travel sector have struggled to survive\". \"Thousands of Brittany Ferries passengers have been disrupted and millions of pounds in income has been lost as a consequence of draconian measures like border closures,\" he said. Rail operator Eurostar said it would \"continue to increase the frequency of our services in the coming weeks\" and that it was \"ready to welcome more passengers on board\". ",

            "content": "Kim Kardashian is among three celebrities being sued by investors in the EthereumMax crypto-currency. Other defendants include boxer Floyd Mayweather Jr, basketball player Paul Pierce, and the currency's creators. The legal action alleges the celebrities collaborated with EthereumMax to \"misleadingly promote and sell\" the crypto-currency. EthereumMax said it disputed the allegations and looked forward to the truth coming out. In spite of its name, EthereumMax has no legal or business connection with the Ethereum crypto-currency. The class action claims EthereumMax operated a \"pump and dump\" scheme - where misleading marketing is used to inflate the price of an asset then sold to unwitting investors at a profit. The complaint filed with the Central District Court of California alleges the \"company's executives, collaborating with several celebrity promotors\" made \"false or misleading statements to investors about EthereumMax, through social-media advertisements and other promotional activities\". The defendants \"touted\" the ability of \"investors to make significant returns\", it alleges, resulting in an artificial increase in the price of the crypto-currency, \"causing investors to purchase these losing investments at inflated prices\" and, in turn, enabling the executive staff of EthereumMax named in the legal action to \"sell their EMax tokens to investors for a profit\". \"In plain terms, EthereumMax's entire business model relies on using constant marketing and promotional activities, often from 'trusted' celebrities, to dupe potential investors into trusting the financial opportunities,\" the court filing alleges. It alleges former National Basketball Association (NBA) player Mr Pierce promoted EthereumMax in a \"widely discussed\" post on Twitter, in May 2021, \"praising EthereumMax's ability to make money for him\". At the same time, EthereumMax started to use former world champion Mr Mayweather's boxing match with YouTuber Logan Paul to promote the crypto-currency. Mr Mayweather is said to have also promoted EthereumMax at a crypto-currency conference. Finally, reality-TV personality Kim Kardashian, the complaint alleges, published an Instagram post, saying: \"This is not financial advice but sharing what my friends tell me about the EthereumMax token.\" The head of the UK's Financial Conduct Authority, Charles Randell, later said Ms Kardashian had \"asked her 250 million followers to speculate on crypto tokens\", suggesting the post - marked as a an advert - may have been the \"financial promotion with the single biggest audience reach in history\". At the time, EthereumMax told BBC News its marketing and public-relations efforts \"are always from an awareness perspective and not encouraging to purchase - as the Kim K post was simply intended to raise awareness of the project and its utility\". \"It is our intention that our marketing and PR efforts encourage people to research our project... before making a decision,\" it said. \"This approach takes a lot of time, energy, and resources and is in stark contrast to the quick pump-and-dump schemes out there.\" However, such promotion caused the currency to increase in value to over 1,300% more than its initial price before plummeting to \"an all-time low\" just over a month after Ms Kardashian's post, the court filing alleges, enabling defendants to \"offload\" EthereumMax tokens \"for substantial profits\" while many of those who purchased currency during this period lost out. The claim names as plaintiffs in the case those who invested between 14 May and 27 June 2021 and were \"damaged thereby\". EthereumMax denied the claims. Steve Gentile, identified in the filing as the \"co-founder/creator of EthereumMax\", told BBC News: \"The deceptive narrative associated with the recent allegations is riddled with misinformation about the EthereumMax project. \"We dispute the allegations and look forward to the truth coming out.\" BBC News has sought comment from Ms Kardashian, Mr Mayweather and Mr Pierce.

            "content": "Benefits should rise to match the soaring cost of living as millions face crippling price rises driven by energy bills, a think tank has said. Many benefits and the state pension are inflation-linked, but - by convention - rates for this year were set before prices started rising rapidly. It means most will only go up by 3.1% in April, half of the expected increase in the cost of living. The government said it had already taken \"decisive action to help\". The Institute for Fiscal Studies (IFS) said 10 million people were affected by price hikes that were not matched by benefit rises. Raising benefits and the state pension to the same level as inflation in April would mean preventing a £290 real fall in benefit income year on year for this huge group, the economic research body said. \"Doing so would compensate benefit recipients on average for higher costs, including energy costs. This need not be a permanent increase. Future up-rating can be adjusted once inflation has fallen back,\" said Robert Joyce, IFS deputy director. Such a rise, albeit temporary, to benefits, Pension Credit and the state pension would cost the Treasury £4.5bn, which makes such a move highly unlikely, not least for political reasons. Experts say £10,900 a year needed to retire Households with typical energy usage face a £600-700 rise in annual bills without government intervention. That would put a typical annual energy bill close to £2,000. The rise in the state pension set for April amounts to an annual increase of less than £300. Chris O'Shea, chief executive of British Gas owner Centrica, told the BBC there was \"no reason\" to expect gas prices would come down \"any time soon\". The IFS points out that lower-income households spend almost three times as much of their budgets on gas and electricity as the highest-income tenth on average (11% versus 4%). It said that, to help these people, the government should consider a long-term change that meant rises in benefits and the state pension should not be linked to inflation seven months prior to the change, as is the case now. Instead, the decision should be taken much closer to April, when the increases take effect. In the meantime, financial experts have said that everyone needs to brace for a year of rising prices. \"Our budgets are coming under extreme pressure from the big squeeze, and for the next few months it is only going to get worse,\" said Sarah Coles, senior personal finance analyst at Hargreaves Lansdown. However, the government said it had already taken \"£4.2bn of decisive action\". \"This includes increasing benefits in line with the inflation measure from September, the Energy Price Cap which is saving 15 million households £100 a year on average, and winter fuel payments, which are supporting over 11 million pensioners with their energy bills,\" a government spokesperson said. \"Our £500m Household Support Fund is also providing low income households with essentials over winter,\" they added.

The sandwich chain said it wanted to invest in its staff as it recovered from the coronavirus pandemic which has battered its business. It is the second time it has raised pay since September and comes as employers face a widespread worker shortage. Some Pret staff have complained about pay and their workload during Covid. The sandwich chain, which has 550 shops around the world, said its basic pay rates would increase from between £9.40 and £9.56 to between £9.80 and £10.15 per hour, with baristas being paid more. That means at least 6,900 of its more than 8,500 staff will be paid over £10 per hour. Pret said its mystery shopper bonus scheme will also be boosted from an additional £1 an hour, to £1.25. Under the scheme Pret outlets are visited, rated and staff are rewarded according to the standard of service, products and cleanliness they're providing. Sainsbury's raises pay to £10 an hour\nPret flooded with complaints over drinks deal Several other retailers have boosted staff pay already as they struggle to hire and retain workers. Supermarkets Sainsbury's, Aldi and Morrison's all recently increased their minimum hourly pay to £10. In September, Pret's rival Costa gave workers a 5% pay bump to £9.36 an hour, while Asian fast food chain Itsu boosted its minimum hourly rate by 11% to at least £10.40. Pret's chief executive Pano Christou said: \"We've said all along that as our business recovered, we wanted to invest back into our people. \"After a difficult couple of years, it gives me so much joy to be able to give our hard-working shop teams this news.\" Pret's cafes are usually based in city centres, catering to office staff grabbing takeaway snacks and lunches. It was hit hard by the pandemic as many people started working from home and many of its outlets were closed for long periods. However, the chain has faced criticism during the crisis, after it ruled last summer that workers would no longer be paid during their breaks - a policy that remains in place. Former Pret staff also told the BBC in December that a drinks subscription service it introduced had left some workers feeling overwhelmed by their workload. The service, which offers unlimited hot and cold drinks for £20 a month, faced customer complaints when some popular drinks were unavailable. ",

            "content": "A professional recruitment firm says it is placing graduate lawyers at top firms on starting salaries as high as £150,000 amid a shortage of workers. Alan Bannatyne, chief financial officer at Robert Walters, told the BBC people in many UK industries were quitting for better paid jobs amid soaring demand. \"15% is the minimum pay rise we're seeing, but some are increasing their salaries by up to 50%,\" he said. \"Unless something significant happens, 2022 should be even better for staff.\" UK job vacancies have hit record levels since the economy reopened as employers scramble to meet demand. Robert Walters, which focuses on placing professionals in roles, said this had put firms in a \"fierce competition for talent\" and it was \"incredibly hard to find the right people\". Employers have put up salaries to attract workers, although Mr Bannatyne said there had been \"winners and losers\" from Covid and not everyone was in a position to pay well. \"Bricks-and-mortar retailers and airlines have really struggled so will probably not be paying bonuses or giving pay rises,\" he told the BBC. \"So they become a hunting ground for other high growth businesses, such as online retailers, anything to do with technology and digital, and manufacturers of household goods.\" Sainsbury's raises pay to £10 an hour\nStarter salaries rise at fastest rate in 24 years\nJob vacancies surge past one million in new record Robert Walters, which has offices in Asia, Europe and the US, said it had seen its best December ever, with net fee income up 39% globally. Recruitment agency Manpower said it was seeing a similar trend, as employers struggled to fill vacancies for highly-skilled positions. UK director Chris Gray told the BBC: \"It is absolutely a candidate-led market right now. \"Those with the in-demand skills hold the power, and have the freedom and flexibility to accept a job that suits their particular needs and expectations.\" Skills shortages have been particularly pronounced in sectors such as law, where vacancies for London-based associates rose some 131% year-on-year between January and November last year, according to research from recruiter BCL Legal and data firm Vacancysoft. According to Robert Waters, there is a shortage of recently qualified lawyers, while reports point to an increase in experienced practitioners quitting the industry. In addition, UK legal firms face intense competition for talent from US law firms expanding in Britain. It's led to newly qualified lawyers at top London firms being offered salaries of over £100,000 before bonuses. According to the Law Society, in 2018 the average salary for solicitors working full-time in private practice was £62,000 a year (rising to £88,000 in London). City banks have also boosted starter salaries to retain talent and Robert Walters predicts the bonus pool this year will be \"huge\". Wages have also been increasing in lower paid jobs. Last week, Sainsbury's became the latest supermarket to pay shop workers at least £10 an hour, following similar moves from Morrisons, Lidl and Aldi. Many workers have revaluated their careers during lockdown and changed jobs or left the workforce, in what some have labelled the \"great resignation\". It has helped to drive up salaries across the UK, with growth in average pay including bonuses standing at 4.9% year-on-year between August and October. James Reed, chairman of recruitment agency Reed Recruitment, said the UK was in the midst of a \"jobs boom\" that showed no signs of abating. \"It's the best time in 50 years to look for a new job, in a situation where the pendulum has swung in jobseekers' favour.\" ",

            "content": "The boss of Ovo Energy has blamed a \"bad day\" for ridiculous advice to customers on how to stay warm amid soaring bills. Stephen Fitzpatrick told the BBC he felt \"really embarrassed\" about the 10-point plan, which included \"doing a few star jumps\" and cuddling pets. Ovo apologised on Tuesday, and Mr Fitzpatrick went on BBC TV and radio on Wednesday to repeat how sorry he was. \"We're a large company and somebody had a bad day,\" he said. He said he was \"really embarrassed\" by the \"ridiculous\" advice emailed to customers of its SSE Energy division on \"simple and cost-effective ways to keep warm this winter\". It comes after concerns over the cost of living amid rising energy bills. \"I'd like to apologise again, I think this is what we're going to be apologising for, for a little while,\" Mr Fitzpatrick told the BBC's Radio 4 Today programme. British Gas owner warns high bills for two years\nHow much would a VAT cut on my energy bill save?\nHow to save energy at home and help the planet He said the email \"should never have been written\", although he added he thought it was \"probably meant with good intentions\". \"The truth is we should have caught it,\" Mr Fitzpatrick continued. On a now-deleted SSE webpage, which offered tips on \"keeping warm in winter without turning up the heating\", SSE suggested wearing extra layers and to keep moving by \"cleaning the house, challenging the kids to a hula-hoop contest, or doing a few star jumps\". Alongside stopping draughts, SSE said people could find \"extra heat\" by leaving your oven open after you've finished cooking and by having \"a cuddle with your pets and loved ones to help stay cosy\". Household and businesses have seen their energy bills rise in recent months as energy suppliers pass on a sharp rise in wholesale gas prices. The Ovo boss won plaudits on social media for the honesty of his apology, with one Twitter user saying it appeared sincere. The BBC is not responsible for the content of external sites.\nView original tweet on Twitter Another user wrote that it was the correct response to \"accept responsibility, take the flak, apologise and commit to doing better\". Nik Govier, founder and chief executive of PR consultancy Blurred, which helps companies with crisis management, said the firm was \"right to be embarrassed\". She said Mr Fitzpatrick's \"genuine\" and \"very human apology\" was the \"right way\" to tackle the mistake, considering the enormous toll on customers. \"Often people hide behind overtly manufactured and carefully crafted quotes rather than speaking themselves to honestly handle the situation\". \"I think this genuine, open acknowledgement of the terrible lapse in judgement will go a long way with customers\". Now more than ever, Ms Govier said, corporate leaders need to speak in a human voice rather than from a \"position of disconnect\" to the millions of people suffering the impact of these difficult times. On Monday, the Energy Efficiency Infrastructure Group called on the government to prioritise energy saving through home improvements, saying better insulation could save UK households more than £500 a year on energy bills. \"Unless the government comprehends how significant this is in the coming weeks, we're going to face a tragic situation where UK households cannot afford to heat their homes,\" Mr Fitzpatrick added. Increased oil and gas demand in Asia, a rapid recovery of some economies after lockdown, and a summer with little wind to generate alternative power, have all contributed to rising energy costs. However, Mr Fitzpatrick said he expected wholesale energy prices to begin drifting lower in 2022. ",

The Grade II* listed Gladstone Pottery Museum in Stoke-on-Trent could be closed for filming as part of council budget plans to save £10m. Money saving measures could also see 19 full time posts cut and open days reduced at the city's Potteries Museum. Campaigners called for the \"appalling\" proposals to be \"thrown out\". There were about 150 factories at any one time during the 19th Century. Council leader Abi Brown said the museums \"do not get the footfall to keep them open seven days a week\". The council's budget plans want to see savings from its museums service of £560,000. Under the proposals, Gladstone would only be open to the public and schools from April to October each year, with the site marketed for \"filming and events\" for the rest of the year.

We really find the plans appalling.\" A public consultation on the proposals is running until 14 February, however since the announcement almost 20,000 people have signed a petition calling for a rethink. Stoke-on-Trent has historically been known for its pottery industry with about 150 factories at any one time during the 19th Century.

            "header": "World Bank warns global economy faces grim outlook",
            "content": "The global economy faces a \"grim outlook\", World Bank president David Malpass has warned, as the aftershocks of the pandemic continue to weigh on growth - especially in poor countries. His organisation's latest forecast predicts global growth will slow to 4.1% this year from 5.5% in 2021. It attributed the slowdown to virus threats, government aid unwinding and an initial rebound in demand fading. But Mr Malpass said his greatest worry was widening global inequality. \"The big drag is the inequality that's built into the system,\" he told the BBC, noting that poorer countries were especially vulnerable to economic damage from efforts to fight inflation. \"The outlook for the weaker countries is still to fall further and further behind. That causes insecurity.\" By 2023, economic activity in all advanced economies, such as the US, Euro area and Japan, is likely to have recovered from the hit it took during the pandemic, the bank said. But output in developing and emerging countries is expected to remain 4% lower than it was before Covid struck. Mr Malpass blamed stimulus programmes in the richest countries for worsening the divide by driving global inflation. While officials in many countries, including the US, are now expected to raise interest rates to try to rein in price increases, Mr Malpass warned higher borrowing costs could hurt economic activity - especially in weaker economies. \"The problem with rate hikes is it hurts people that need floating rate money... and that's usually new businesses, women-owned businesses, developing country businesses,\" Mr Malpass said. Separately, the World Economic Forum (WEF) warned that divergent economic recoveries were making it harder to collaborate on global challenges such as climate change. \"Widening disparities within and between countries will not only make it more difficult to control Covid-19 and its variants, but will also risk stalling, if not reversing, joint action against shared threats that the world cannot afford to overlook,\" the WEF said in its annual global risks report on Tuesday. Business Review of 2021: Climate change and Covid\nHundreds of unions issue vaccine supply chain plea The World Bank's Global Economic Prospects report said that in 2021 the world's economy bounced back from the pandemic with the strongest post-recession expansion in 80 years. But the gains are expected to slow this year, as virus variants and rapidly rising prices for items such as food and energy weigh on households. Globally, inflation is at its highest rate since 2008, the report says. The bank, which lends to countries around the world, also warned that supply chain bottlenecks and the unwinding of stimulus programmes posed risks. The slowdown in the second half of 2021 was already larger than the bank had expected in its June forecast due to the spread of the Omicron and Delta Covid variants. It expects a \"pronounced slowdown\" this year, and predicts global growth will decelerate further in 2023, to 3.2%. \"The reality is that Covid and the shutdowns are still taking a huge toll and that's especially true on people in poorer countries,\" Mr Malpass said. \"Just a grim outlook.\" Driving the global slowdown are China, where the rate of growth is expected to drop to 5.1% from 8% last year, and the US, which is forecast to expand by 3.7% this year compared with 5.6% in 2021. In the eurozone, expansion will slow to 4.2% this year from 5.2%, the bank predicts. India presents a bright spot, with the growth rate expected to rise from 8.3% to 8.7% this year. But many emerging markets continue to struggle with additional challenges, such as lower vaccination rates. In Latin America and the Caribbean, for instance, growth is expected to slow to 2.6% in 2022, from 6.7% last year. ",

            "content": "At least 600,000 passengers scrapped plans to fly from Heathrow Airport last month as the Omicron coronavirus strain sparked tougher travel restrictions. Heathrow boss John Holland-Kaye said it underlined the crisis in the industry and the uncertainty facing travellers. A return to normal \"could be years away\", the chief executive of the UK's busiest airport warned. Just 19.4 million passengers passed through Heathrow in 2021 - 12.3% below 2020, the year the pandemic began. Last year's number, the lowest for Heathrow for 50 years, was less than a quarter of the pre-pandemic levels seen in 2019. Mr Holland-Kaye said it was time for all coronavirus testing measures to be dropped for fully-vaccinated people. Fears over the Omicron Covid variant meant that, from late November, all travellers arriving in the UK were required to take a pre-departure lateral flow test and self-isolate until they received a negative result from a post-arrival PCR test. This led to many people scrapping their travel plans over the festive period. The new rules were relaxed for fully-vaccinated arrivals last week after travel firms said they were ineffective due to Omicron spreading widely within the UK. That move sparked a rush of bookings, airlines reported. What tests do I need to go on holiday? Mr Holland-Kaye said: \"There are currently travel restrictions, such as testing, on all Heathrow routes - the aviation industry will only fully recover when these are all lifted and there is no risk that they will be re-imposed at short notice, a situation which is likely to be years away.\" He warned this creates \"enormous uncertainty\" for the Civil Aviation Authority (CAA), the aviation regulator, as it prepares to set a five-year cap on Heathrow's passenger charges. \"The regulator must focus on an outcome that improves service, incentivises growth and maintains affordable private financing.\" The CAA increased the cap on Heathrow's price per passenger from £19.60 to £30.19 from 1 January, sparking complaints from airlines that the rise was far too high. The CAA is expected to announce a long-term cap running from the summer to 2027 in the coming weeks. Heathrow said travel to and from the Asia-Pacific region in 2021 was particularly badly hit, down 40.3% from a year earlier. The other markets with double-digit reductions were non-EU Europe (down 13.8%) and North America (down 13.6%). Domestic travel bucked the trend, with a 21.1% boost in passengers compared with 2020.

He blogged it was a \"good time to replace myself as CEO\" after working on Signal for over a decade. Signal recently enabled crypto-currency payments within the app, which has concerned some users. Mr Marlinspike remains a board member of the Signal Foundation, while the board's executive chair, Brian Acton, becomes interim chief executive. Mr Marlinspike - whose real name is Matthew Rosenfeld - blogged he had always hoped to reach a point where Signal could \"grow and sustain\" beyond his involvement. \"I was writing all the Android code, was writing all of the server code, was the only person on call for the service, was facilitating all product development, and was managing everyone,\" he wrote. \"I couldn't ever leave cell service, had to take my laptop with me everywhere in case of emergencies, and occasionally found myself sitting alone on the sidewalk in the rain late at night trying to diagnose a service degradation.\" More than 40 million people now use Signal. The app's popularity increased after planned changes to WhatsApp's privacy policy caused some users to switch. It is free, and like WhatsApp, messages are automatically encrypted by default. Both Signal and WhatsApp have benefited from Mr Marlinspike's skills as a programmer and cryptographer. The Signal Protocol, which he developed, was also integrated into WhatsApp, as it has been into several other prominent instant-messaging apps. While Mr Marlinspike's tenure as chief executive has seen Signal grow in popularity, a recent experiment with crypto-currency has troubled some users. In November, the app rolled out to all users a trial of an integrated payment system using a crypto-currency called MobileCoin - which claims to be both highly secure and environmentally friendly. Mr Marlinspike has reportedly provided technical advice to the crypto-currency start-up. Integrating a crypto-currency is, some say, a risky strategy, creating avenues for criminal misuse of the app and putting it within scope of financial legislation - such as anti-money-laundering laws - and regulation. Alex Stamos, formerly Facebook's chief security officer, told The Verge: \"The addition of pseudo-anonymous money-transfer functions greatly increases their legal attack surface, while creating the possibility of real-life harms.\" Mr Marlinspike's replacement, Mr Acton, is also a veteran of the secure-messaging sector. Mr Acton left WhatsApp, which he co-founded, in 2017 - the messaging app had been sold to Facebook, in 2014, in a deal worth $19bn (£11.4bn) in cash and shares. He cites \" differences surrounding the use of customer data and targeted advertising\" as reasons for his departure from WhatsApp. And, in 2018, with Mr Marlinspike, he launched the Signal Foundation, providing funding of $50m.

A total of 736 sub-postmasters were prosecuted over the course of 14 years for crimes such as theft and false accounting. Those still to receive information about access to justice represent about one in six of those convicted. Nick Read, Post Office chief executive, said all victims should be compensated. The case is the most widespread miscarriage of justice in the UK, with some serving prison terms and facing humiliation in their communities for crimes they never committed. Why were hundreds of sub-postmasters prosecuted?\nPost Office scandal: 'It's been a strange 15 years' Various avenues have been available to former sub-postmasters to claim payouts. Those who lost money filling supposed gaps in their accounts - but which were in fact the result of bugs and defects in the computer system - have been able to claim through a historic shortfall compensation scheme. Mr Read told MPs on the business select committee on Tuesday that the Post Office had offered compensation to 777 of the 2,500 postmasters who applied via that route. He said he hoped that lawyers and staff working on the case can make offers to the all but a handful of the claimants by the end of the year. Much of that money will need to be provided by the Post Office's sole shareholder, the government, and ministers have promised to fund the payouts. \"The Post Office itself doesn't have the financial resources to compensate a miscarriage of justice of this scale,\" he told the business, energy and industrial strategy committee. So far, 72 convictions have been overturned. Mr Read said that 66 of those people who have seen their convictions overturned have applied for an interim £100,000 payment designed to \"bridge the gap\" until a full settlement can be reached. Of these, 57 have received these payments, with negotiations and possible test cases earmarked to draw up the final settlements. \"It is my intention that we do give full and final compensation of all the victims of the past and their families,\" Mr Read said. \"There is an enormous amount of complexity associated with making sure we get absolutely right how we compensate those postmasters. And most importantly that it's full, it's fair and it's final.\" Negotiations are also ongoing with 555 people who received a civil payout, and were excluded from the historic shortfall scheme. Much of their compensation was swallowed up by legal fees. Business minister Paul Scully told MPs they were having to overcome huge mistrust in the system from those wronged over the course of 20 years in order for everyone to receive access to justice and compensation.

            "content": "One of Britain's largest energy suppliers has apologised after it advised customers they could cuddle pets and eat porridge to stay warm. Ovo Energy said it was \"embarrassed\" after a link to a blog \"containing energy-saving tips\" was sent to its SSE Energy Services customers. The company said it had removed the blog so it could \"update it\" with \"more meaningful information for customers\". It comes after concerns over the cost of living amid rising energy bills. Ovo Energy acquired SSE Energy Services in 2020 but the brands are still separate. In a statement to the BBC, Ovo Energy said it recognised the content of the blog was \"poorly judged and unhelpful\". \"We are embarrassed and sincerely apologise,\" the supplier added. \"We understand how difficult the situation will be for many of our customers this year.\" On a now-deleted SSE webpage, which offered tips on \"keeping warm in winter without turning up the heating\", SSE suggested \"10 simple and cost-effective ways\" to stay warm and keep bills down. The advice included wearing extra layers and to keep moving by \"cleaning the house, challenging the kids to a hula-hoop contest, or doing a few star jumps\". Alongside stopping draughts, SSE said people could find \"extra heat\" by leaving your oven open after you've finished cooking and by having \"a cuddle with your pets and loved ones to help stay cosy\". Speaking to the Financial Times which first reported the story, Darren Jones, chair of the Commons business select committee, called the advice \"insensitive\". \"Being told to put on a jumper instead of turning on your heating if you can't afford it, at a time of such difficulty for so many families, is plainly offensive,\" the Labour MP told the newspaper. In a tweet following Ovo Energy's apology, Mr Jones said: \"Good, I'm glad they apologised. I'm not sure who signed off a marketing campaign telling people to wear a jumper and eat porridge instead of turning on the heating if you can't afford it.\" Household and businesses have seen their energy bills rise in recent months as energy suppliers pass on a sharp rise in wholesale gas prices. How much would a VAT cut on my energy bill save?\nHow to save energy at home and help the planet Increased oil and gas demand in Asia, a rapid recovery of some economies after lockdown, and a summer with little wind to generate alternative power, have all contributed to rising energy costs. Another problem is that much of the UK's housing stock is ageing and very poor at retaining heat, leaving residents particularly exposed to jumps in gas prices. On Monday, the Energy Efficiency Infrastructure Group called on the government to prioritise energy saving through home improvements, saying better insulation could save UK households more than £500 a year on energy bills. Trade body Energy UK has predicted bills will surge by up to 50% in April, when the change to the price cap, due to be determined in February, kicks in. It said the average household could end up paying about £700 more per year. That along with UK inflation at a 10-year high and expected to increase further has prompted warnings of a cost-of-living \"crisis\". ",

            "content": "Ikea has cut sick pay for unvaccinated staff who need to self-isolate because of Covid exposure and in some cases for workers who test positive. The retail giant acknowledged it was an \"emotive topic\" but said its policy had to evolve with changing circumstances. From this week, sick pay cuts will be implemented at Wessex Water and in the US several major companies have started penalising unjabbed workers. It comes as firms struggle with mass staff absences and rising costs. At Ikea unvaccinated workers, who do not have mitigating circumstances, who test positive will be paid in line with company sick pay. Unvaccinated workers, without mitigating circumstances and required to isolate owing to being identified as a close contact, could now receive as little as £96.35 a week - the Statutory Sick Pay (SSP) minimum. Self-isolation guidance for people who have been jabbed was relaxed last month. However, there was no change to the guidance for unvaccinated people who come into contact with positive cases, and who must still self-isolate for 10 full days after their date of exposure to the virus. Covid staff shortages will continue into New Year\nIkea to raise prices as supply problems bite Average wages at Ikea are between about £400 and £450, depending on location and, as is the case at many companies, staff get enhanced sick pay. The move was first reported by the Mail on Sunday. Ikea, which employs about 10,000 people in the UK, said in a statement: \"Fully vaccinated co-workers or those that are unvaccinated owing to mitigating circumstances which, for example, could include pregnancy or other medical grounds, will receive full pay. \"Unvaccinated co-workers without mitigating circumstances that test positive with Covid will be paid full company sick pay in line with our company absence policy. \"Unvaccinated co-workers without mitigating circumstances who have been identified as close contacts of a positive case will be paid Statutory Sick Pay.\" In England, people who are vaccinated with at least two doses need not self-isolate if they have been in close contact with someone infected with Covid. Unvaccinated people contacted through the government's test-and-trace system must still isolate by law. Many companies complained of labour shortages throughout 2021, and now are seeing mass absences due to the more infectious Omicron Covid strain. Prime Minister Boris Johnson repeated on Monday that the data continued to show those people most seriously affected by Omicron remained the unvaccinated. Wessex Water's sick pay rule change comes into force this week. Any employee without at least one Covid-19 vaccination - who does not have a valid medical reason - or does not have a confirmed vaccination appointment, will get only statutory sick pay if required to self-isolate due to close contact with someone testing positive. A Wessex Water spokesperson said absences have soared this year: \"The vast majority of our workforce has been vaccinated and it's important as a company providing essential services with key worker employees, the remainder get vaccinated to protect themselves, customers and their colleagues. \"Absences due to Covid have doubled in the last week, so we need everyone to be available so we can continue to provide uninterrupted essential water and sewerage services.\" The company said that throughout the pandemic it had not furloughed staff and those self-isolating had received full pay. Last year, supermarket Morrisons cut sick pay terms, while several companies, including banking giant Citigroup, introduced a \"no jab, no job\" policy. Delta Airlines imposed a surcharge on unvaccinated staff members of its healthcare plan. Ben Willmott, head of public policy at the Chartered Institute of Personnel and Development (CIPD), told the BBC there were pros and cons with changing sick pay terms for certain workers. It could encourage staff to get vaccinated, but others might be less likely to test themselves or self-isolate because they could not afford time off work at the statutory rate of about £96. His organisation's official guidance was not to differentiate between employees, as the consequences could be complex and there were potential legal problems. \"You would have to manage it on a case-by-case basis because of legal risks,\" Mr Willmott said. Earlier this month, David Josephs, boss of food importer and retailer All Greens, told the BBC that staff at some firms were ignoring Covid rules for financial reasons. \"We know that in our sector a lot of staff do not get paid sick pay. Ours do - but staff who are on limited contracts or on minimum wage cannot afford to be off work,\" he said. Employment lawyer Sarah Ozanne, of CMS, also warned of complex legal issues and said striking the right balance was difficult. \"This action [by Ikea] seems more of a reaction to staff shortages and how to manage them than any intended 'discrimination' of the unvaccinated,\" she said. \"But employers should consider whether their actions are proportionate as a means of achieving the aim of getting employees back into work.\" ",

            "content": "Shoppers swapped party outfits for comfy clothes in the Christmas sales as the Omicron Covid variant saw festive parties cancelled and the return of working from home guidance. Helen Dickinson, boss of the British Retail Consortium (BRC), said loungewear was \"back in fashion\". But despite rising cases and concerns over a possible lockdown, UK retailers posted strong sales in December. Clothes and jewellery dominated Christmas gift buying at the tills. Total sales rose 2.1% in December compared with the same period a year earlier, according to statistics from the BRC-KPMG retail sales monitor. They were up by nearly 5% over a two-year period before the pandemic. Over the three months to December, total food sales increased 0.4%, while non-food retail sales rose 4.8%. Pandemic fashion: 'From sequins to sweatpants'\nBoden boss declares the end of formal office wear Ms Dickinson, chief executive of the BRC, said despite the concerns over Omicron, \"retail sales held up through December\". \"Loungewear was back in fashion, as many pre-empted the possibility of future restrictions,\" she added. \"Meanwhile, the return of work-from-home advice and reduction in Christmas social events, caused formalwear sales to slow.\" Compared to December 2020, when the UK was subject to Covid restrictions during parts of the month, online sales fell 13.9% last month, as shoppers returned to High Street stores. Paul Martin, UK head of retail at KPMG, said footwear was the only online category to see mild growth. But for the year as a whole, online sales grew by 14.3% overall on 2020. Despite the positive sales figures in December, Ms Dickinson said businesses faced \"significant head winds in 2022, as consumer spending is held back by rising inflation, increasing energy bills, and April's National Insurance hike\". \"It will take continued agility and resilience if they are to battle the storm ahead, while also tackling issues from labour shortages to rising transport and logistics costs,\" she added. With UK inflation at a 10-year high in November, and the rate expected to increase further in the next few months, many analysts are warning of a cost-of-living \"crisis\". Businesses are also bracing for higher energy costs due to surging wholesale gas prices. Figures from Barclaycard showed a jump in essential spending for December but flagged that the spread of Omicron weighed heavily on hospitality and leisure spending. The credit card spending data revealed total spending rose 12.2% in December, lifted by a 13.7% rise in essential spending, which was driven by supermarket shopping and fuel. Restaurants saw spending slide by 14.1% against pre-pandemic levels from 2019. Jose Carvalho, head of consumer products at Barclaycard, said more Brits \"were either isolating or choosing to stay at home due to the new variant, which hampered face-to-face retailers as well as hospitality and leisure outlets\". Retailers are starting to issue their Christmas trading updates, with discount chains among the strong gainers. On Tuesday, the UK arm of Germany's Lidl said that in the four weeks to 26 December its sales rose 2.6% from a year earlier as it benefited from shoppers switching from other supermarkets. Lidl said its Christmas jumpers were the fastest selling non-food and drink product, with one sold every two seconds on first day of sale. Christian Härtnagel, Lidl GB chief executive, said the pandemic had been challenging, but added: \"As inflation continues to rise, I want to reassure each and every one of our customers that we remain resolute in our promise of being the destination for the lowest grocery prices in the market.\" That came a day after Aldi said its Christmas performance was boosted by record sales of its premium range food and strong demand for beer, wine and spirits. Last week, discount chain B&M raised its profits expectations after reporting a strong festive trading period. Major supermarkets report trading updates this week, with Marks & Spencer and Tesco tipped by analysts to have done particularly well. ",

            "content": "Cash-strapped Chinese real estate giant Evergrande has moved out of its Shenzhen headquarters to cut costs. Evergrande said it had moved to a property that it owns, but that it was still in the same city. It comes as its rival Shimao Group said on Tuesday it is in talks with potential buyers for some properties as it tries to reduce its debts. The firms have come under intense pressure in the last six months after Beijing moved to curb their borrowing. China's property crisis is estimated to have wiped more than a trillion dollars off the value of the sector last year. How China is trying to limit the Evergrande crisis\nHow China's crackdowns are impacting business Evergrande, the world's most indebted property developer, is struggling to make payments on its more than $300bn (£220bn) of liabilities and has missed payments on its offshore debt. \"In order to save costs, the company has gone through the lease cancellation procedures for Houhai Excellence Center in December 2021 and moved to its own property in Shenzhen,\" Evergrande said in a statement on its website. \"The company's registered place has not changed and is still in Shenzhen,\" it added. In September, the building was the scene of protests by Evergrande investors who crowded its lobby to demand repayment of loans and financial products. Evergrande's logo was seen being removed from the skyscraper's facade on Monday. However, it kept hopes alive that it could avoid defaulting for the first time on its onshore yuan bonds. That came as it extended until Thursday a deadline for bondholders to agree to a six-month deferral on a $706m payment. Evergrande's Hong Kong-listed shares have lost almost 90% of their value in the last year as investors became increasingly concerned that it could be close to collapse. Separately on Tuesday, real estate company Shimao denied a media report that it had entered into a preliminary agreement to sell one of its prime properties, the Shanghai Shimao International Plaza. But the company did say in the statement to the Hong Kong Stock Exchange that it was \"in discussions with certain potential purchasers and may consider disposing of certain properties if the terms and conditions are appropriate in order to reduce the indebtedness of the Group\". Shimao's shares were trading slightly lower on Tuesday, after surging by almost 20% the previous day. ",

            "content": "When you have to find an extra £60 a month to pay your energy bill, something has to give. For John Alderson, deciding on the occasional meal out or a trip to the cinema has become a more significant financial decision. The 64-year-old, who works in North Shields for a cleaning company, is one of millions of people for whom the cost of domestic energy is going to take a big chunk out of the family budget. Most people are going to see their bill rise sharply in April, when a new - much higher - energy price cap takes effect. Mr Alderson is already feeling the impact. He had shopped around for the cheapest supplier, but his fixed-price deal came to an end in November. When such a deal expires, customers automatically move onto a default tariff, which is protected by regulator Ofgem's price cap - but which will rise by hundreds of pounds in April when suppliers are allowed to recoup some of the higher wholesale costs they face. Energy bills set to rise by 50%, industry warns\nWe don't know how high bills will go - energy boss Experts suggest the vast majority of people are better off doing nothing and reverting to the default tariff. However, some people like Mr Alderson, have decided that certainty on bills for the next 18 months meant it was worthwhile signing up to a new fixed deal. The trouble is, it is expensive. He says the cost is \"all-consuming\". \"It makes me feel angry. It is a very difficult thing to experience. At the moment we're financially OK, but I worry about other people on the breadline or paying with a meter. We will pay our bills, we always do. But not everyone is so lucky,\" he says. \"Then I get annoyed because there's very little we can do about this, we can gripe and groan, but what can we do?\" Mr Alderson says options to keep the heating off are limited because his daughter is having to work from home owing to the pandemic. This, he says, is another scenario facing lots of people through no fault of their own. Also feeling aggrieved is Tony Hughes, from Kent, who is already paying more for his energy - but for a different reason. He was a customer of Avro, one of nearly 30 suppliers that have ceased trading as a result of the gas price crisis. Why are gas prices so high? When a supplier folds, its customers are automatically transferred to another supplier. Their energy supply is protected, but their tariff - so how much they pay - is not. Mr Hughes was moved, ended up paying considerably more on the new variable tariff, and is braced for that to rise again in April. It means that, by the spring, he expects his annual energy bill to have risen by £1,400. Listen to Mr Hughes on Radio 4's Broadcasting House \"Lots of people do not realise they will face this too,\" he says. \"We are having to subsidise this through our savings.\" He says that having saved throughout his working life for a nice retirement, he now is using that money for the heating. \"This is through no fault of my own. It is difficult to find that amount of money these days. I've accepted it's beyond my control, but I'm worried about the further increase which could happen soon,\" he says. \"I just hope it's short lived. I can live with it for a year and hopefully prices will drop. \"The government has got to do something. They've got to help the companies in the short term or help the customer. Some people might not have savings. It shouldn't be about eating or heating. We expect things to vary a bit, but that's a huge increase. I can't understand how people who are already struggling are going to afford it.\" Trade body Energy UK has predicted bills will surge by up to 50% in April, when the change to the price cap, due to be determined in February, kicks in. It said the average household could end up paying about £700 more per year. The prime minister has said he met Chancellor Rishi Sunak to discuss the cost of living issues being faced by households. Boris Johnson said he had been meeting the chancellor \"constantly\". \"I understand the pressures people are facing on their household finances\" he said, \"It's making life very tough. We've got to help people, particularly people on low incomes, we've got to help people with the cost of their fuel.\" Labour and the Liberal Democrats have called for a windfall tax on North Sea oil and gas producers to fund measures to ease the cost for consumers.

            "content": "Tesla's automated driver assist feature has added an assertive driving mode. The setting will follow other cars more closely, change lanes more frequently, not leave the overtaking lane, and perform rolling stops. Such driver behaviour by humans is often discouraged by safety groups. However, it could sometimes be safer for an automated system to be more assertive, like a human driver, rather than being overly cautious, one motor safety expert said. The three driving profiles - chill, average, and assertive - were first added in Tesla's October update. That update, however, was quickly pulled because of other issues, but the driving profiles feature has now been restored. A screenshot of the update was posted to Twitter by David Zipper, a technology writer and visiting fellow at Harvard Kennedy School, and was first reported by The Verge. The BBC is not responsible for the content of external sites.\nView original tweet on Twitter It shows the assertive mode described as: \"Your Model X will have a smaller follow distance, perform more frequent speed lane changes, will not exit passing lanes and may perform rolling stops.\" The list of behaviours has been criticised by some on social media as being less safe. But Matthew Avery, from the UK's Thatcham Research, said that well-designed driverless systems are theoretically safer than human drivers because they eliminate human error. As such, if a more assertive driving style encourages more drivers to take up self-driving systems than a very cautious style would, that could be a net gain for safety. \"If we want widespread adoption of automation, drivers are going to expect the vehicle to do and make the decisions that you would do as a human driver, not some very benign and very safe algorithm,\" he explained. Human drivers come to an impasse regularly, such as when one has to pull over in a single-lane country road or at a four-way intersection, and one driver must make the move first. Two extremely careful automated cars might both wait for the other to act. \"This is what the manufacturers are trying to learn at the moment,\" Mr Avery explained. \"So, a degree of being slightly less cautious, If that means more people use the systems more of the time because they feel that they're more human-like, that's a good thing.\" But he warned that it depends on how \"assertive\" the system is - and said it must avoid aggressive driving. \"It's a fine line between assertive and aggressive, but definitely there are situations when automation going through some very basic rules will eventually sort of stop because it just can't progress,\" he said. \"I don't think we're there yet. I don't think the technology is sophisticated enough.\" In many jurisdictions, failing to come to a complete halt at a stop line is illegal, and can result in someone failing their driving test. As a habit, many drivers simply come to a slow crawl - or a rolling stop - instead, but it is considered a dangerous technique. Tesla disables gaming while driving feature\nOutage locks Tesla drivers out of their cars These appear to be part of both Tesla's average and assertive modes. The description that the car \"will not exit passing lanes\" also seems to contradict some regional rules. Tesla's so-called \"Full Self-Driving\" feature is currently only available in the US as part of a limited test. But in the US, where they drive on the right, several states - but not all - have made it illegal to leave the right-hand lane unless overtaking. Similarly, in the UK, the Highway Code says motorists should always stay in the left lane unless overtaking, and return to the left when safe to do so. It is not clear if Tesla's system will account for national or state-based variations in the rules about staying in the overtaking lanes, or what the term rolling stops means in relation to stop signs. Tesla to recall 475,000 cars in the US\nParis taxi firm suspends Tesla model after crash The company has disbanded its media relations department and does not respond to queries from journalists. Tesla's so-called full self-driving has been subject to much scrutiny, with crashes and incidents involving the technology gaining widespread media coverage. It is not, despite its name, a self-driving technology, but is rather considered a driver assistance feature similar to other car-makers' lane assist technology. It is at level two on a five-point scale of automated systems. Tesla owners must remain in control of the vehicle and alert at all times, ready to take over in an instant for safety. ",

Household and businesses have seen their energy bills rise in recent months as energy suppliers pass on a sharp rise in wholesale gas prices. Increased oil and gas demand in Asia, a rapid recovery of some economies after lockdown, and a summer with little wind to generate alternative power, have all contributed to rising energy costs. The Office for National Statistics said 12% of businesses said either production or suppliers or both had been affected by increases in wholesale gas prices. Labour said its own analysis suggested nearly one in four UK businesses had been affected by higher gas prices. We don't know how high bills will go - energy boss\nWhy are gas prices so high? Mr Reynolds said \"viable firms\" were at risk of \"going to the wall because of government failures over the last decade\". \"The government has been asleep at the wheel, with British firms, especially those energy-intensive businesses, paying the price,\" he added. Labour said the £600m \"contingency fund\" to support struggling firms, including energy intensive industries, such as manufacturing companies, would be financed by the one-off windfall tax on record North Sea Oil and Gas profits. The party said it will force a vote in parliament on Tuesday, which will call for the government to scrap business rates and create its suggested £600m contingency fund. Labour has said such a windfall tax on North Sea gas and oil producers would also help households deal with the expected rise in gas and electricity bills. Shadow chancellor Rachel Reeves told the BBC on Sunday that the UK was \"uniquely exposed\" to global energy price rises. Trade body Energy UK has predicted bills will surge by up to 50% in April, when the change to the price cap, due to be determined in February, kicks in. It said the average household could end up paying about £700 more per year. And with UK inflation at a 10-year high in November, and the rate expected to increase to further in the next few months, warnings of a cost-of-living \"crisis\" have been voiced. The Liberal Democrats has also called for a windfall tax on energy firms. A statement from the government said: \"The Energy Price Cap is currently insulating millions of consumers from high global gas prices. We'll continue to listen to consumers and businesses on how to manage the costs of energy. \"Thanks to our diverse mix of nuclear, gas and renewable technologies, the UK has one of the most reliable energy systems in the world.\" ",

            "content": "Labour has called for a windfall tax on North Sea gas and oil producers to help limit the expected rise in household gas and electricity bills by £200 The party says its £6.6bn plan would also remove VAT on domestic energy costs for a year and increase the warm homes discount for poorer households. Shadow chancellor Rachel Reeves told the BBC the UK was \"uniquely exposed\" to global energy price rises. But the government said it was working to manage the impact on consumers. And Prime Minister Boris Johnson has not ruled out taking steps to tackle the rising cost of energy, amid pressure from some of his own backbench MPs. Government discusses support for higher fuel bills\nWe don't know how high bills will go - energy boss\nHow much would cutting VAT on energy bills save me?\nWhy are gas prices so high? The trade body Energy UK predicts bills will surge by up to 50% in April, when the change to the price cap, due to be determined in February, kicks in. This could leave an average household paying about £700 more per year, it says. UK inflation hit a 10-year high in November, with the rate expected to increase to further in the next few months, while National Insurance contributions are set to rise in April. This has led to warnings of a cost-of-living \"crisis\". Labour is attempting to seize the initiative with a call for a windfall tax on oil and gas producers. The idea is not new. Previous Labour and Conservative governments have done it and the Lib Dems called for a similar move last week. But timing is everything, and the government is under pressure to ease the impact of rising energy bills, living costs and its looming increase in National Insurance payments. Boris Johnson has not ruled out taking steps to soften the blow, but so far has only said what he doesn't want to do - cut VAT on energy bills. In opposition, Labour has the luxury of being able to put forward a menu of policy options to try to make the government look indecisive. But it's the prime minister and the chancellor who'll have to find a politically palatable way to ease the acute strain coming to households and businesses. Doing nothing, it seems, is not an option. Under Labour's plan, North Sea energy producers, their profits boosted by price rises, would be forced to pay £1.2bn to mitigate household bills through a year-long increase to their corporation tax of 10 percentage points. The party also wants an extra £3.5bn to be spent on the warm homes discount, increasing it from £140 to £400 per year, while doubling the number of households eligible to 9.3 million. VAT, currently set at 5% for household energy bills, should be removed for a year from April - six months longer than Labour has previously called for - the party adds. The prime minister has argued that a VAT cut would be too \"blunt\" a tool, as it would affect all households, including the richest, rather than targeting those most in need. But Labour says its proposals would save most households about £200, while targeted support to lower earners and pensioners would save them £600. Ms Reeves told BBC One's Sunday Morning there were some \"pretty staggering\" energy bill rises in store for households. \"The problem is that so much of this has been caused by more than a decade of dither and delay in energy policy by the government,\" she said. \"The UK is uniquely exposed because of a failure to invest in nuclear and hydrogen and renewables.\" Labour's plans are unlikely to become policy in time for April, as it is not in power, but the party is keen to put as much pressure on the government over what it sees as a central issue for millions of voters. The Liberal Democrats also called for a windfall tax on energy firms earlier this week, with leader Sir Ed Davey saying: \"It can't be right that a few energy fat cats are raking it in from record gas prices while millions of people can't even afford to heat their homes.\" Conservative former energy minister Chris Skidmore has backed the idea of a windfall tax, which has been imposed by previous Labour and Tory governments. Former Conservative Chancellor Lord Lamont told BBC Radio 4's The World This Weekend that, of Labour's proposals, increasing the warm homes discount would provide \"a much bigger bang for your buck\" than cutting VAT or a windfall tax. \"Windfall taxes tend to stick and then become permanent,\" he said. \"People don't have much sympathy when the prices go down and the windfall taxes remain.\" A government spokesman said: \"The energy price cap is currently insulating millions of consumers from high global gas prices. We'll continue to listen to consumers and businesses on how to manage the costs of energy. \"We recognise people are facing pressures with the cost of living, which is why we are taking action worth more than £4.2bn, and supporting vulnerable households through initiatives such as the £500m household support fund, warm home discount, winter fuel payments and cold weather payments.\" ",

            "header": "Aylesbury: 'There's undiscovered beauty in our town'",
            "content": "A website poll this week declared the Buckinghamshire town of Aylesbury was the worst place to live in the country. What do local businesses, attractions and people think of the claim? Although it only won garden town status in 2017, Aylesbury has a long and varied history stretching back to the iron age. This week is was deemed the worst town in England in a reader poll run by the Ilivehere website, It is not a description some in the town want to leave unchallenged. They say while the town often gets a \"bad press\", Aylesbury is a place which is \"extremely welcoming and friendly\" with \"lots of hidden gems to be found\". Tom Jenkinson is the director of the Aylesbury-based The Chiltern Brewery. He says people need to \"look below the surface\" and find \"the beautiful parts of Aylesbury\". The brewery was set up by his father during the 1970s in barns attached to the family home. \"We love the local area,\" Mr Jenkinson says. \"We have concentrated on the area and we are now growing and working with local people and businesses.\" The brewery opened an on-site shop in the 1990s, took on an independent pub in the town in the 2000s and during lockdown began delivering its products to people in the local area. \"When we set up the The Farmers' Bar at The King's Head in the heart of Aylesbury we didn't want any national brands,\" he says. \"It's all local.\" This year, the business hopes to build a brand new brewery on the existing site and will be working with Waddesdon Manor using barley grown there to produce a truly local beer. \"The town often gets hit with bad press,\" he claims. \"But there are beautiful parts to Aylesbury - St Mary's Church, the cobbled streets, good independent shops, the theatre. \"It also has beautiful countryside and links to London.\" The Waterside Theatre is one of the focal points in Aylesbury. Built 11 years ago, the venue hosts West End productions, plays, musicals, comedy shows and community events. Theatre director Sophie Denney says the town is \"extremely friendly and very family focused\". When the theatre had to cancel panto shows due to Covid in 2020, she says, the majority of people moved their tickets to 2021 which really helped the business. \"The hardest part for us was the not knowing and the uncertainty about whether we could open. \"We are very fortunate our audience members were so understanding,\" she says. Along with mandatory face-masks, the theatre has introduced Covid passports for guests. \"We have received a lot of positive feedback that they feel safer in the building due to these measures,\" Ms Denney says. \"Now people are slightly less keen to travel into London due to Covid, it's amazing to have so many brilliant productions on your doorstep.\" Ms Denney, who recently moved to the area herself, says Aylesbury has \"a lot going on\". \"It's surrounded by phenomenal nature and beauty. \"The canal, the museums, different festivals and just the culture of Aylesbury is extremely welcoming and friendly.\" Waddesdon Manor, a National Trust site managed by the Rothschild Foundation, sits on 6,000 acres of land on the outskirts of Aylesbury. In the past year it has welcomed almost 400,000 visitors. As well as offering tours around the manor, the estate also hosts events such as Christmas markets, light trails and exhibitions. This year a number of concerts will be held in the gardens, starting with Michael Bublé on 2 July. \"So Michael Bublé himself will be experiencing Aylesbury, which is very exciting,\" chief executive Simon Wales says. Mr Wales says there are \"lots of hidden gems to be found\" in the town. \"There is a wealth of things to do and get involved in,\" he says. \"It's such a great location, you can be urban but be in nature and countryside within minutes. \"People are always really surprised that there's a really beautiful canal in the centre of Aylesbury.\" Mr Wales says the Waddesdon Greenway, a cycling and walking route linking Aylesbury Vale Parkway Station with the manor, is \"a real enhancement to peoples lives\". He explained that businesses in the area have been \"working with each other more closely\" to ensure people can easily enjoy everything Aylesbury has to offer. \"We're all excited for this year,\" he says. Wendover Woods is managed by Forestry England and offers a range activities on-site. Recreation manager Owen Manson says the pandemic had made people consider health and wellbeing a lot more, with many opting to make use of the \"open, green space for socially distanced meetings\". \"The team haven't stopped through the entire pandemic,\" he says. \"We've worked really hard to keep facilities up and running for people who were looking for that safe space and trying to get in touch with the environment.\" Mr Manson says the people of Aylesbury had been \"appreciative of what we have here\". \"It's a real asset on your doorstep. \"There are fantastic things going on in the town. \"It has real community spirit and the people are welcoming and friendly,\" he says. \"Everyone is in it together.\" Find BBC News: East of England on Facebook, Instagram and Twitter.

            "header": "Hiring slows in US after record year of job gains",
            "content": "Hiring in the US slowed last month, as firms struggled to hire workers and continued to grapple with the effects of coronavirus. Employers hired just 199,000 people in December, a second month of weaker than expected gains. But the jobless rate dropped sharply to 3.9% and wages rose, the Labor Department said. The mixed data, which was collected before Omicron's full force was felt, follows a record year of jobs growth. \"For a second straight month, we have conflicting pictures emerging,\" said Mark Hamrick, senior economic analyst at Bankrate.com. \"This report appears to reflect the state of play before the worst impacts of the Omicron variant hit the economy.\" \"We will have to wait until the following report, covering the job market picture in January, to get a clearer picture,\" he added. The US added more than 6.4 million jobs in 2021, regaining many of the positions lost at the height of the pandemic in 2020. Though total employment remains about 3.6 million lower than its pre-pandemic level - and far lower than it would have been if Covid had not struck - many signs point to a strong economy. A record 4.5 million Americans quit jobs in November - a sign of confidence in the labour market - and more than 10 million positions stand open, the government reported this week. Jobless claims have dropped to a near 50-year low. How Covid deepened America's teacher shortages\nFederal Reserve takes tougher stance on inflation \"I could hire three full-timers and one part-timer on the spot,\" said Konstantinos Tsoulos, owner of Brothers Bagels in Brooklyn, New York. In September, he decided to close the shop on Mondays due to the staff shortage. He said he has not had a single person inquire about a job. \"I've been in business almost 35 years and I've never seen anything like it,\" he said. December's job gains were felt across most industries, led by leisure and hospitality. The unemployment rate fell to 3.9% from 4.2%, while average hourly earnings were up 4.7% year-on-year. US President Joe Biden called the figures \"historic\", saying they reflected an economy back on its feet thanks to a flood of government spending championed by his administration. Wells Fargo economist Sarah House said future growth would be determined by worker availability. \"December's report underscored that workers are only likely to trickle back into the jobs market as reasons for sitting out, like financial cushions, health concerns and childcare issues do not unwind all at once,\" she said. The labour shortages have helped to push inflation in the US to its highest rate in almost 40 years. In response, America's central bank has signalled it plans to start removing support for the economy, raising interest rates potentially as soon as March. But the emergence of the Omicron variant has complicated the outlook for the economy. The virus has been blamed for widespread worker absences in recent weeks, prompting the cancellation of thousands of flights, the closure of major school districts and strains on hospitals, transport systems and other businesses. Mr Tsoulos said his business has been holding on thanks to patronage from neighbourhood families. But he is worried by the shift to remote working, which has cut into his commuter business and the catering orders he used to receive from offices. \"Everybody was touting that the downtown office buildings would open after Labor Day and nothing happened. Then they said January and it's almost mid-January,\" he said. \"Now they're talking June.\" ",

            "content": "Holiday bookings have surged and demand has increased after the testing rules for international travel were relaxed. Jet2 said demand had returned to \"around pre-Covid levels\". The holiday company saw a \"huge spike\" in bookings, boss Steve Heapy told the BBC, after the government said pre-departure tests for fully vaccinated people would be scrapped. EasyJet said its bookings rose almost 200% compared to last week, while Tui said it experienced a \"strong uptick\". EasyJet said flights to Spanish destinations Tenerife, Alicante, Malaga and Lanzarote were the most in demand, with bookings for the latter up 427% week on week. The airline has put about 1.1 million more seats on sale from London Gatwick for summer 2022. Pre-departure Covid travel tests to be scrapped\nWhat tests do I need to go on holiday? Jet2's Mr Heapy told the BBC's Today programme that before the rule changes on Wednesday, bookings were \"well below\" usual levels, but added the relaxation of measures gave people \"the confidence that perhaps they won't be caught in resorts quarantining\", with bookings up 150% on Thursday. He said Jet2 has a larger summer holiday package for 2022 than 2019. \"People are desperate to get away, that's been demonstrated over the past couple of days,\" he added. Mr Heapy said the Omicron Covid variant had showed that governments should perhaps \"bide your time and look at the science a bit before jumping into lockdown\". \"We can't just jump into lockdowns and further restrictions every time there is a new variant. We have to learn to live with it and hopefully this is the beginning and the end and we can get back to some normality,\" he added. \"It's been very tough for the travel industry. The biggest thing this industry needs is not lots of bailouts from the government, we just need to fly. \"We just need to take people away and we will be profitable, we will be paying tax, contributing to the economy and to do that we need stability.\" EasyJet said Brits were planning more holidays than usual in 2022 and will spend more money on them, according to its own survey. The airline said a third 2,000 people surveyed plan to spend around £1,000 more than usual as a result of having had travel plans disrupted by travel restrictions. Sophie Dekkers, chief commercial officer at easyJet, said the summer should see the company \"return to 2019 levels of capacity and beyond\". The shake-up in the travel rules was announced by Boris Johnson on Wednesday, following calls from travel firms who said the measures were not effective now that Omicron was spreading widely. Under the new rules: From 04:00 GMT on Friday 7 January, people who are fully vaccinated and those aged under-18 will no longer need to take a test two days before travelling to England from countries outside the UK and the Common Travel Area. On arrival, they will have to take a PCR test but they will no longer have to self-isolate while awaiting the result\nFrom 04:00 GMT on Sunday 9 January they will only have to take a lateral flow test instead of a PCR test on day two. But this test must be bought from a private test provider - free NHS tests are not allowed\nUnvaccinated passengers will need to continue to take a pre-departure test, PCR tests on day two and day eight, and self-isolate for 10 days Alistair Rowland, chief executive of long-haul tour operator Blue Bay Travel, said the day of the rule change announcement was the company's busiest day for website traffic and booking enquiries in over a year. \"The volume of enquiries received yesterday matched that of January 2020 daily levels, which is something we couldn't have imagined a month ago, when these testing rules came in and consumer confidence plummeted,\" he said. \"Our most popular destination for bookings right now is the Maldives.\" Tour operator Tui said customers had been given the \"reassurance\" that travel \"will once again be easier and more affordable\", but added it had not seen demand return to levels seen before the pandemic. Tui said Mexico and the Dominican Republic were proving the most popular destinations currently, with the Canary Islands, Cape Verde and Egypt also seeing increased demand. British Airways searches for holidays on its website increased by nearly 40% compared to last week. ",

            "content": "Smart-speaker firm Sonos has won a major legal battle against Google over patents it said the firm had infringed. The decision means that Google's smart speakers and other smart home tech that uses the offending systems cannot be imported to the United States. Sonos contends that Google will have to \"degrade\" its speakers if it refuses to pay Sonos a licensing fee. But the tech giant says it has already devised workarounds to prevent any interruptions. Google says it disagrees with the ruling, by the US International Trade Commission, and will \"continue to defend ourselves against Sonos' frivolous claims about our partnership and intellectual property\". The commission found that Google had infringed all five patents Sonos complained about, upholding an initial decision made in August 2021. The patents relate to multi-room speakers, and how they synchronise to play music at the same volume across multiple rooms or \"zones\" in a home. Multi-room audio was Sonos' standout feature when it first launched, winning the fledgling company an innovation award at the CES tech shows in 2005. Sonos chief legal officer Eddie Lazarus said in a statement that the features affected by the US ruling included \"the set up for controlling home audio systems, the synchronisation of multiple speakers, the independent volume control of different speakers, and the stereo pairing of speakers\". Amazon launches UK 'child-friendly' smart speaker\nAlexa-hijacking ex spared jail over revenge nude\nSonos makes jump to Dolby Atmos with new soundbar \"There is a possibility that Google will be able to degrade or eliminate product features in a way that circumvents the importation ban,\" he said - something he argued would \"sacrifice consumer experience\" while still infringing patents and racking up damages. \"Alternatively, Google can - as other companies have already done - pay a fair royalty for the technologies it has misappropriated,\" he said. However, Google pointed to tweaked designs it had put forward during the legal battle which avoided using Sonos' patents, and said the trade commission had not taken issue with the new system. Nevertheless, the Google Nest smart home team has published a notice that users \"will need to adjust each speaker individually\" rather than all at once, and will \"no longer be able to change your speaker group volume using your phone's physical volume button\". A small number of users may also need to use a special app to complete set-up. \"While we disagree with today's decision, we appreciate that the International Trade Commission has approved our modified designs and we do not expect any impact to our ability to import or sell our products,\" a Google spokesperson said. Google said it would also \"seek further review\". The trade commission ruling has a 60-day grace period before the import ban, while the ruling is subject to presidential review. Google's statement that it does not expect any disruption may suggest that its workarounds will be ready by then. Sonos and Google have been embroiled in a series of long-running battles and have come to blows over the implementation of smart assistants - such as Google Assistant - in Sonos' tech. There are currently a number of other active lawsuits between the two. ",

            "content": "Asda has backed out of a commitment it made in October to stock exclusively British beef, angering farmers. National Beef Association (NBA) chief executive Neil Shand said he was \"deeply disappointed\" by Asda's choice. Asda said their policy had changed because of the rise in British beef prices. \"Whilst we continue to work hard to keep prices as low as possible for our customers, these increases are significant\", a spokesperson said. Farmers are struggling with feed, fertilizer and energy costs escalating at rates \"never seen before\", according to the NBA. \"Our supermarkets need to support domestic producers as much as possible - now more than ever,\" Mr Shand said. Morrisons and Co-op both told the BBC they would continue to only sell British beef, despite the rise in prices. \"We're proud to support British beef farmers and Co-op was the first national supermarket to commit to only selling 100% own brand British meat and poultry. We also only use British meat ingredients in our frozen products and sandwiches and ready meals,\" Co-op said in a statement. An Aldi spokesman said the grocer had \"no plans to change\". Asda said all fresh beef in its premium Extra Special tier would remain 100% British, while all of the rest of its fresh beef would be sourced from farms in the UK and Republic of Ireland. The country's largest supermarket, Tesco, also sources the fresh beef it sells in the UK from either the UK or the Republic of Ireland. Asda declined to comment on the decisions of other grocers. In a statement, the supermarket said: \"We know that it is important to our customers that the beef on our shelves has been produced to high welfare standards and is affordable.\" Food firms call on government to fix supply chain\nShoppers return to supermarkets for festive feasts Republic of Ireland beef is currently around 20% less expensive than British, according to the Irish Examiner. Ireland accounted for almost 80% of UK beef imports in 2020, according to Bord Bia, the Irish Food Board. Beef makes up nearly half of all meat imports to the UK according to the British Meat Processors Association (BMPA). In response to Asda's shift, Deborah Deymond, a beef farmer who has a herd of 80 cattle in Rattery, said: \"Farmers believe in long term commitments and so should supermarkets\". \"I was so pleased to hear they had made the pledge in October but think it's disgraceful they're not supporting British farmers more\". \"You cannot have a good product for next to nothing prices and supermarkets should value domestic farmers properly,\" she added. National Farmers Union (NFU) livestock board chairman Richard Findlay, was also disappointed and said that, given the \"significant\" changes to trade and agricultural policy, it was \"more important than ever\" for retailers to \"champion\" British farmers. Mr Findley said that any sourcing commitments made by supermarkets need to be honoured. \"Our beef is renowned for its quality and high production standards, and retail support plays a big part in enabling farmers to make further investments in climate and environmentally-friendly food production,\" he added. Asda made the initial announcement after it was bought by the Issa brothers, two entrepreneurs from Blackburn who made billion-pound fortunes running petrol stations. It is Britain's third-largest supermarket chain. ",

            "header": "Energy firms call for green levies on bills to be scrapped",
            "content": "The bosses of two energy firms are calling for green levies on bills to be scrapped to help customers facing higher prices. The founder of Ecotricity described the levies on energy bills as a \"stealth tax\" of hundreds of pounds a year. Centrica's boss is also urging government to fund green programmes through general taxation instead. Thousands of households have seen their energy bills rise in recent months. Spiralling wholesale gas prices, increased demand for energy in Asia and a summer with little wind have all contributed to soaring costs faced by suppliers and consumers. Ecotricity boss Dale Vince told the BBC's Wake up to Money programme: \"The government talk about high energy prices and bemoan them... but what they don't talk about is the fact they take £9bn a year from our energy bills in a combination of VAT and about five social and environmental policies.\" Currently, about 12% of an energy bill set at the level of the Energy Price Cap of £1,277 goes towards funding green energy programmes, such as support for low-carbon electricity generation. The price cap, which sets the maximum rate a supplier can charge annually on a dual fuel tariff in England, Scotland and Wales, will go up again in April after a review by the regulator Ofgem. Mr Vince suggested that prices could jump because of green levies applied to bills. \"That's about half of the rise that's coming through the price cap. [The government] could take that away in a flash,\" he said. Writing in the Sun on Friday, the chief executive of British Gas owner Centrica, Chris O'Shea, suggested stripping environmental and social levies out of energy bills and to \"fund 'green' programmes through general taxation instead\". Mr O'Shea argued the move would reduce annual bills by £170 and spread the cost more fairly. He also called on the government to consider suspending VAT on energy bills to help struggling households. We don't know how high bills will go - energy boss\nWhy are gas prices so high? Torsten Bell, chief executive of the Resolution Foundation think tank, said suspending VAT would make a \"small dent\" to higher costs, but that it might not be as effective as it would benefit higher-earners as well. \"The important thing is that we have a much larger intervention aimed at lower-income households,\" he said. Energy suppliers have already warned that the impact of rising wholesale gas prices on households will be \"an enormous crisis for 2022\", with fears that bills could soar by another 50% unless the government intervenes. The idea of targeted financial support for fuel bills - along the lines of the current Warm Home Discount scheme - is emerging as a frontrunner in the race to tackle rising costs, although a number of options are being considered by government officials. The current scheme offers those receiving certain state benefits the option to apply for a one-off £140 payment every winter. This could be increased and the number of people eligible could be expanded more broadly. A spokesperson for the Department for Business said that the current energy price cap was \"insulating millions of consumers from high global gas prices\". \"We'll continue to listen to consumers and businesses on how to manage the costs of energy.\" The department also pointed to schemes currently in place to help those facing high bills, such as the Warm Home Discount scheme, as well as the £500m Household Support Fund, which sees local councils distribute grants to struggling households in England. Ecotricity boss Mr Vince also suggested that North Sea gas suppliers should face a windfall tax as some have seen profits increase as wholesale prices have surged. According to experts at energy consultancy Wood MacKenzie, UK North Sea oil and gas companies are set to report near-record cashflows of nearly £14.9bn for the current financial year. Shell, for example, said on Friday that it expected \"significantly higher\" gas revenues in the three months to December, despite ongoing supply issues. \"The North Sea operators have been making a killing this winter,\" Mr Vince told the BBC. \"A windfall tax would be a fair thing to do, the North Sea operators don't need that money, weren't planning to have that money and it's a hole we've got in the economy somewhere else.\" Energy watchdog Ofgem has also put forward a proposal for a third-party finance scheme, where bank loans would allow energy suppliers to spread out the cost of taking on new customers from failed competitors. The Financial Times reported that NatWest and Barclays were in talks with the regulator, although both declined to comment when asked by BBC News. Ofgem has launched a consultation on the scheme as an option \"which would help reduce household bills from April 2022.\" An Ofgem spokesperson said if the scheme were approved, it would help the industry spread extra costs over several years.

            "content": "Bitcoin prices have fallen to their lowest level in months following remarks from the US Federal Reserve. The crypto-currency dropped in value from $47,000 (£34,700) earlier this week to less than $42,000 (£31,000) per digital coin. It follows minutes from a meeting of the Federal Reserve, which suggested it may raise interest rates. Political events in Kazakhstan have also raised concerns about the network's capacity. Because of its global and decentralised nature, attributing a rise or fall in the price of Bitcoin to a single cause is difficult. But many commentators have pointed to the release of the Federal Reserve's December meeting notes as one factor. The minutes suggest that America's central bank might raise interest rates sooner than some had anticipated, and sell off some of its assets. That could have led to a knock-on effect of traditional investors who hold Bitcoin, as they pursue less risky assets instead. At the same time, a huge amount of the world's Bitcoin mining - the process by which transactions are verified and new \"coins\" made - takes place in Kazakhstan. The massive Central Asian country has been hit with political unrest this week, as citizens took to the streets to protest against rising fuel prices. Fatal violence followed as demonstrators - which the country's leaders paint as \"rioters\" - seized buildings in the largest city, Almaty. Kazakhstan is thought to process nearly a fifth of all Bitcoin \"mining\", as the process is called, due to its usually cheap electricity. And an internet shut-down earlier this week appeared to hit the processing power of the entire Bitcoin network. This is what happened: Bitcoin started the week at a price above $47,000 per coin\nThat began to slip by mid-week to around $46,000\nOn Wednesday, the Federal Reserve minutes were released\nBy Thursday, the price fell sharply to around $42,000\nIt hit a low of nearly $41,000 at one point on Thursday before recovering slightly The dip means Bitcoin has hit its lowest price since September 2021, down from a November peak of more than $60,000. Other crypto-currencies have also seen price falls. Ethereum saw its value drop from approximately $3,800 on Wednesday to under $3,200 on Friday. Why have there been riots and deaths in Kazakhstan?\nCambridge data shows Bitcoin mining on the move\nBBC Bitcoin mining report used in crypto-scam Matthew Dibb from Singapore-based crypto-company Stack Funds told Reuters news agency: \"We are seeing broad risk-off sentiment across all markets currently, as inflationary concerns and rate hikes appear to be at the forefront of speculators' minds.\" He also warned that \"there is risk of a retreat back to the mid-30s on the short term\". Crypto-currencies, and particularly Bitcoin, continue to face criticism. The BBC is not responsible for the content of external sites.\nView original tweet on Twitter The Mozilla Foundation - the group which makes the Firefox web browser among other open-source software projects - announced it would no longer accept crypto-currency donations after pushback from users. The group has accepted crypto-currency donations for years, but a recent tweet reminding people of that fact led to an angry response, as the digital currency's energy use and unregulated nature continue to be controversial among many critics.

            "content": "UK house prices rose at a faster rate in 2021 than in any calendar year since 2004, according to the Halifax. The mortgage lender said buyers sought more space during lockdown and took advantage of low-cost borrowing and stamp duty holidays. Prices increased by 9.8% during 2021, it said - the fastest for any calendar year since a 12.5% rise in 2004. The average UK property price hit a new record high of £276,091 in December, it added. In cash terms, that was a £24,000 rise in the cost of the typical home over the course of the year. However, growth is expected to slow this year due to higher mortgage rates and a squeeze on household incomes. Cities start to attract property buyers again\nThe epicentre of Britain's house price boom The UK's housing market \"defied expectations\" last year, said Russell Galley, managing director at the Halifax. \"In 2021 we saw the average house price reach new record highs on eight occasions, despite the UK being subject to a 'lockdown' for much of the first six months of the year,\" he said. \"The lack of spending opportunities afforded to people while restrictions were in place helped boost household cash reserves. \"This factor, alongside the stamp duty holiday and the race for space as a result of homeworking, will have encouraged buyers to bring forward home purchases they'd maybe planned for this year.\" However, he added: \"Looking ahead, the prospect that interest rates may rise further this year to tackle rising inflation and increasing pressures on household budgets suggest house price growth will slow considerably.\" Lucian Cook, head of residential research at estate agency Savills, said UK housing remained a \"strong sellers' market\", particularly for family homes. \"There is an expectation the market will slow. We don't see the triggers for a price correction. From an economic perspective, unemployment was the big risk in that respect and that looks to have been contained,\" he told the BBC's Today programme. Other agents have reported continued demand from buyers, despite January traditionally being a quiet time of the year for the sector. That competition will continue to make things difficult for first-time buyers who may have a tighter budget owing to limits on how much they can offer as a deposit and therefore restrictions on what they can borrow from mortgage lenders. Surveys, and official figures, show the biggest house price rises in 2021 were generally outside of London, with notable demand in coastal and rural areas. ",

            "header": "Investors threaten drug maker bonuses over vaccine access",
            "content": "A large coalition of investment firms want the bosses of coronavirus vaccine makers to have their bonuses withheld if they fail to improve product distribution. This could guarantee a \"more equitable\" global circulation of the vaccine, said Rogier Krens chief investment officer of Achmea Investment Management. Drug makers said they are making sure lower income countries have access. Over nine billion doses have been administered worldwide. Why most of Africa has missed global vaccine target\nWHO: New Covid-19 variants will emerge unless more are vaccinated\nHundreds of unions issue vaccine supply chain plea Mr Krens said that the group of 65 companies, which collectively control almost $3.5tn (£2.59tn) in assets, believes that vaccines are \"not distributed fairly at the moment\". Overall, China and India have administered the highest number of doses, with nearly three billion and 1.5 billion respectively. The US is third, with more than 500 million. Many poorer countries are relying on deliveries from Covax, a scheme led by Gavi, the Vaccine Alliance, together with the WHO and the Coalition for Epidemic Preparedness Innovations (CEPI), which is trying to ensure everyone in the world has access to a Covid vaccine. So far the scheme has distributed more than 900 million vaccines. \"What we're asking the companies to do is to tie their remuneration policy and strategy to a more equitable distribution of the vaccine,\" Mr Krens explained. If they don't commit to a fairer distribution, he said the groups first step will be to vote against any remuneration proposals that don't take this into consideration. Asked if that means trying to withhold bonuses if the concerns aren't addressed, Mr Krens, replied \"effectively yes\". Figures collated by Our World in Data - a collaboration between Oxford University and an educational charity, show that many of the countries with the lowest vaccination rates are lower income African nations such as Burundi, DR Congo and Chad. Meanwhile, those at the top of the list are wealthier countries such as the UAE, Portugal and Brunei. Last week the head of the World Health Organisation reiterated the importance of vaccines in ending the pandemic. Dr Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesu warned against \"narrow nationalism and vaccine hoarding\", and added that if \"we end inequity, we end the pandemic\". A fairer distribution of vaccines makes sense from both a humanitarian and financial perspective, according to Mr Krens. \"We definitely feel it's our responsibility to invest in companies that act in a socially responsible way,\" he said. When it comes to the money that the group manages for pension funds and other clients Mr Krens explained that a continuation of the pandemic as it's going now, would be a \"threat\" to the economy and eventually, a threat to their investment returns. The massive gap in vaccination rates between advanced economies and poorer nations could cost the global economy $5.3tn over five years according to the International Monetary Fund. The group of investors have voiced their concerns in a letter to the boards of Pfizer, Moderna, AstraZeneca and Johnson & Johnson. In their statement, they highlight the World Health Organisation's roadmap which calls for 70% of the population of every country to be vaccinated by the middle of this year. The roadmap calls on vaccine manufacturers to be more transparent about production schedules and to prioritise contracts with Covax and Avat which aim to improve the distribution of vaccines in poorer countries. Vaccines makers said they are doing what they can to ensure that doses are spread out fairly. WHO chief optimistic about beating Covid in 2022\nOmicron and Delta driving case tsunami - WHO\nWorld's top Covid vaccine maker halves production AstraZeneca, which has worked with Oxford University on its vaccine, said it is \"producing its COVID-19 vaccine for no profit to low income countries and has distributed most of its supply to low and middle income countries.\" Johnson & Johnson said that approximately 60% its COVID-19 vaccines have been shipped to low and middle income countries and that fair access to them has been \"at the forefront\" of its response to the pandemic. It added that its executive pay strategy \"is designed to promote long-term, sustainable value creation\". Moderna and Pfizer haven't responded to requests for comment. However last year, in an open letter Pfizer's chief executive Albert Bourla wrote that the biggest restriction on expanding manufacturing was \"scarcity of highly specialised raw materials\". International political efforts to improve vaccine production and distribution through a wavier of intellectual property rights have stalled. Hopes for an agreement at the World Trade Organisation were dented when it's in person Ministerial Conference was abruptly cancelled in late November. Achmea's Rogier Krens believes that such a sharing of the vaccine manufacturing know-how has an important role to play in improving vaccine distribution. Although they have largely resisted so far he said: \"We're actually calling actively for the pharmaceutical companies to contribute in that area\". He argued that increasing vaccine supply is crucial to getting more people protected from coronavirus. Mr Krens said that the coalition of investors can bring about change from the drug makers, even if it doesn't happen overnight, because it's size equates to \"quite a strong voice\". ",

The vouchers - offering a 6p saving if they spent £30 - were sent out to customers by the supermarket giant. One shopper from Stevenage said she \"couldn't believe it was a serious offer\" and it was \"hardly worth it\". Sainsbury's apologised and said the vouchers should have stated it was a saving of 6p on every litre of fuel. Coupons offering savings of £4.50 on a spend of £30 or more when used with a Nectar card were sent to customers, alongside the baffling ones offering 6p off when a customer spent £30 in a store. The latter would have brought a £30 bill down to £29.94. The customer from Stevenage, who did not wish to be named, said: \"I couldn't believe it was a serious offer when I saw the 6p coupon. \"Let's face it, it would be hardly worth the effort to go to a store, park up, walk up and down the aisles, spend £30 plus - and all to save 6p.\" It was only by reading the small print in among the terms and conditions on the rear, that it became apparent the coupon was, in fact, for fuel. Sainsbury's admitted its offer had not gone quite as planned. \"There was a printing error on a recent coupon which should have read, 'Save 6p per litre of fuel',\" a spokesperson said. \"Customers can still redeem the coupon and we're sorry for any confusion.\" Find BBC News: East of England on Facebook, Instagram and Twitter.

            "content": "High Street giants Next and Greggs have both said they are raising prices as they seek to offset higher wage and manufacturing costs. Next, which reported strong sales over Christmas, said its prices would increase by up to 6% next year. Greggs, Britain's biggest bakery chain, said it had raised prices between 5p and 10p on items across its range of sausage rolls and cakes. A Greggs spokesman said the move was \"very much a last resort\". Next said that prices for its spring and summer clothing and homeware ranges would rise by 3.7% from a year earlier, while it expects a 6% increase for autumn and winter goods. Its forecast came as it said sales for the three months to 25 December were up 20% compared with pre-pandemic 2019, boosted by a strong revival in \"formal and occasionwear\". Next's online business saw sales soar by 45% from two years ago, whereas sales at its High Street stores were down 5.4%. Next also upped its profit forecast for the year. It now expects to make an extra £22m, taking annual profits to £822m, which would be nearly 10% higher than in 2019. The company is forecasting sales of full-price goods to rise by 7% overall in 2022, but it warned that this year could see a tougher trading environment, given the financial pressures facing households, such as higher energy bills. Next also said it was facing higher costs itself, hence the need to increase its prices by more than previously expected. The company said it had seen higher shipping and manufacturing costs. Wage costs were also climbing as a result of the increase in the National Living Wage and because of staff shortages in some areas, \"most notably in warehousing and technology\". Next is the first of the big retailers to tell us its Christmas story. And it's had a strong one. The business had been expecting weaker growth, but it was much better than expected, adding an extra £70m of sales helped by a revival in adult formal and \"occasionwear\". And this was despite lower levels of stock. Online sales were up 45%, which more than offset falling sales in its stores. Even before the pandemic, more than half of the group's sales were already online, making it well placed to benefit from the huge shift in shopping habits. This performance puts Next firmly in the winner's camp. It says forecasting the year ahead is unusually difficult. With soaring fuel bills and a rise in the cost of living, the big question is, how much discretionary spending consumers will be able to make? It's having to put up prices on products, too. But this is a retailer that's better placed than most to cope with the cocktail of cost increases and challenges facing retailers this year. Analysts praised Next for its performance, with the retailer also announcing a special dividend of 160p a share. \"For all the tales of woe on the High Street, there is one shining jewel to be found in the form of Next,\" said Sophie Lund-Yates, equity analyst at Hargreaves Lansdown. \"There aren't many bricks-and-mortar retailers dishing out special dividends or upgrading guidance multiple times over.\" She added that Next had managed its business \"very well - stock levels have reduced, and labour shortages didn't derail performance\". Shoppers return to supermarkets for festive feasts\nShoppers shun Christmas sales as footfall drops Greggs' chief executive, Roger Whiteside, said that the decision to raise prices, taken after an end of year review, was unavoidable. \"We try and absorb as many of the cost increases that get passed to us as possible and then put through price increases where we can't avoid it, and we've done that this year,\" he told the PA news agency. \"The question is, does the inflationary pressure recede or go up.\" Greggs said sales at its stores had eased in the run-up to Christmas and staff absences increased due to the rise of the Omicron variant. Like-for-like sales for 2021 were down 3.3% compared with the pre-pandemic levels of 2019, but in the fourth quarter, they were up 0.8%. Mr Whiteside, who leads employees across more than 2,000 outlets, also announced that he would step down from the role later this year and retire. He will be replaced by Roisin Currie, who is currently Greggs' retail and property director. \"This looks a solid internal appointment, particularly given her key role in developing the delivery business,\" said analysts at Jefferies. Next is the first major retailer to report on how it performed over the key Christmas trading period, although there were updates from other companies on Thursday. Discount retailer B&M said its full-year profits were set to come in ahead of forecasts, with sales in the three months to 25 December up 14% from pre-pandemic levels. The company also announced its 24,000 staff would get an extra week's wages as a bonus for their \"considerable efforts this year\".\nHomeware retailer Made.com reported a 38% rise in sales during 2021 to £434m. Boss Philippe Chainieux said he was \"delighted\" with how the business was performing, adding that measures it had implemented were now easing the impact of \"industry-wide supply chain issues\". ",

            "content": "Fines will be waived for anyone who submits their self-assessment tax return up to a month after the normal deadline of 31 January. HM Revenue and Customs (HMRC) said fines would not be enforced for anyone who files by 28 February. The move has been met with surprise. Typically, not meeting the deadline results in an automatic £100 penalty. HMRC said Covid had put added pressure on individuals and tax advisers to complete online submissions. The tax agency said 6.5 million customers had already filed their tax returns for the 2020-21 financial year, just over half of the 12.2 million required to do so. \"We know the pressures individuals and businesses are again facing this year, due to the impacts of Covid-19,\" said Angela MacDonald, HMRC's deputy chief executive. \"Our decision to waive penalties for one month for self-assessment taxpayers will give them extra time to meet their obligations without worrying about receiving a penalty.\" It is the second year in a row that such a decision has been taken on fines, owing to the pandemic. Rishi Sunak: The taxman takes the strain In addition, anyone unable to pay their self-assessment tax by 31 January will not receive a late payment penalty if they pay their tax in full, or set up a time to pay arrangement (which spreads the cost over time), by 1 April. However, interest will still accrue on any unpaid tax from 1 February. Groups representing tax advisers and accountants welcomed the move, but said it was also designed to ease pressure on HMRC. \"It is a very surprising and unexpected move, acknowledging possible difficulties taxpayers have faced because of the recent impact of coronavirus,\" said Nimesh Shah, chief executive at Blick Rothenberg. \"It is a repeat of what they did last year even though the disruption from the pandemic this year has not been as profound. \"However, HMRC may be more concerned by the number of returns which remain unfiled, and the pressure to extend the timeframe as the deadline became closer.\" Lucy Frazer, financial secretary to the Treasury, said: \"We recognise that Omicron is putting people under pressure, so we are giving millions of people more breathing space to manage their tax affairs.\" ",

            "header": "We don't know how high energy bills will go, says boss",
            "content": "It is impossible to know yet how high household energy bills might go after the next review of the price cap, one energy boss has told the BBC. Octopus Energy's chief executive Greg Jackson said the sector was working to \"minimise cost increases\". The price cap, which sets the maximum rate suppliers can charge for a default tariff, means the typical household should pay no more than £1,277. Some experts have said it could jump in April as gas prices continue to soar. The new level for the price cap, which applies to England, Scotland and Wales, is due to be announced on 7 February. Government officials have suggested that is the absolute deadline for offering fresh support for firms as costs mount. Have your energy bills gone up recently? Email haveyoursay@bbc.co.uk. Mr Jackson told the BBC's Today programme: \"The reality is that in the energy sector, the UK buys most of its energy on a global market and we've had to pay about £20bn more than usual this year. \"So in one way or another, the UK's going to have to pay that money.\" Government discusses support for higher fuel bills\nEnergy bills set to rise by 50%, industry warns\nWhy are gas prices so high? The government and representatives from the Department for Business have been meeting energy bosses in recent weeks to try to tackle the cost-of-living squeeze, as well as attempting to prevent more suppliers from going bust. One option would be to subsidise the energy companies themselves by creating a fund which would allow them to draw on government cash when wholesale gas prices were very high, then pay it back when prices dipped again. Mr Jackson pointed out that energy firms often spread costs by buying gas six, 12 or 24 months in advance in a process called hedging. But he said a fund would allow companies to \"spread [costs] over a longer period of time, so we smooth the bills for customers in the UK\". He also suggested it was the job of the sector as a whole to drive down costs for consumers. \"I should say that the days of energy companies making fat profits are long gone and the entire sector is loss-making, because we're now so focused on driving costs down for customers,\" he added. \"That's the area where we as companies can work hard.\" As the bell rings on a new year, consumers are already prepared to receive some hefty financial body shots. Exactly how much of a stinging blow is not entirely clear as yet. But we do know the big hit will come in April, when tax increases and huge energy price rises take effect. Even if the weather is warmer by then, most people pay their gas and electricity bills in smoothed-out monthly direct debits. The financial pain will be intense and immediate. That is why the details of any potential support packages currently being discussed are so significant. Those individuals and businesses already up against the ropes hope the assistance will be enough to allow them to absorb the punchy bills rather than throw in the towel. Last month, other suppliers warned that more urgency was needed in finding a solution. Ovo Energy's boss Stephen Fitzpatrick predicted that the rise in wholesale gas prices and its impact on people would be \"an enormous crisis for 2022\". And Energy UK, the industry's trade body, warned bills could soar by another 50% unless the government intervened. Labour has urged the government to use the money raised through higher than expected VAT receipts, driven by the higher cost of food and energy prices, to cut household energy bills. But a Treasury source told the BBC that rising energy bills would lead to a net reduction in VAT - not an increase. The source claimed that with extra money spent on energy bills, where VAT is relatively lower at 5%, people would be spending less money on other goods which carry higher rates of VAT and therefore there would be a net reduction in the amount raised. The idea of targeted financial support for fuel bills - along the lines of the current Warm Home Discount scheme - is emerging as a frontrunner, however. The current scheme offers those receiving certain state benefits the option to apply for a one-off £140 payment every winter. This could be increased and the number of people eligible could be expanded more broadly. Government sources confirmed on Wednesday this was \"under discussion with other options\" and the prime minister referred to the scheme twice in the previous 48 hours. Liberal Democrat leader Sir Ed Davey has called for the Warm Home Discount scheme to be expanded. Speaking to the BBC's Today programme, he said: \"The Warm Home Discount, which currently is £140 to two million people, I think we should more than double that to at least £300, but increase the eligibility to seven and a half million people. \"These are people on Universal Credit, people on disability benefits, people on pension credit. I want to make sure that working-age families with children get real help with their bills.\" Warm Home Discount: Worth £140 a year. It has been at this level for nearly a decade and is a one-off reduction on bills given by energy companies, although not all suppliers provide it. It is allocated on a first come, first serve basis to some low-income pensioners and younger low-income households who have to apply to receive it. Ministers plan to raise it to £150 in 2022, and extended availability to about three million households in England, Wales and Scotland, excluding Northern Ireland\nCold Weather Payment: Worth £25 for each seven days of sub-zero temperatures in your area between November and the end of March. It is available to broadly the same group of recipients as the Warm Home Discount but it is paid automatically and covers the whole of the UK\nWinter Fuel Payment: Worth between £100 and £300. This is non means-tested and paid to households with at least one person of pension age (66 and above), and some younger people on legacy benefits. It is paid automatically and covers the whole of the UK A spokesperson for the Department for Business said that the current energy price cap was \"insulating millions of consumers from high global gas prices\". \"We'll continue to listen to consumers and businesses on how to manage the costs of energy.\" The department also pointed to schemes currently in place to help those facing high bills, such as the Warm Home Discount scheme, as well as the £500m Household Support Fund, which sees local councils distribute grants to struggling households in England.

            "header": "NFT marketplace OpenSea valued at more than $13bn",
            "content": "An online marketplace OpenSea says it is now worth $13.3bn (£9.8bn) following a new investment of $300m. The platform enables trade in NFTs (non-fungible tokens), unique pieces of digital code that can be associated with a digital asset such as a work of digital art. Some NFTs have sold for millions of dollars. OpenSea says trades on the platform rose 600-fold last year, but some critics say the valuation is too high. \"In 2021, we saw the world awaken to the idea that NFTs represent the basic building blocks for brand new peer-to-peer economies,\" wrote Devin Finzer, who co-founded the company in 2017, But others argue the spiralling valuations of some crypto-businesses reflects a shortage of places for investors to put their money. \"There's far too much money sloshing around and far too few places to put it,\" said author David Gerard. \"Even the rich are buying lottery tickets.\" The valuation for OpenSea comes at a time when an increasing number of businesses, sports clubs and celebrities are producing or purchasing NFTs. Recently the rapper Eminem spent about $450,000 on an image of a \"Bored Ape\" resembling him. The Bored Ape Yacht Club (BAYC) is a collection of thousands of NFTs of digital illustrations of anthropomorphic apes. Bored Apes are among the most popular NFTs - the total value of trades just passed $1bn according to data from Cryptoslam - an NFT industry data aggregator. Not everyone shares the rapper's appreciation of the digital artworks. The Guardian's art critic Jonathan Jones called them a \"very ordinary and derivative bit of comic book design\". But BAYC says each ape image is \"unique and programmatically generated from over 170 possible traits, including expression, headwear, clothing, and more\". In-demand NFT sells for $3,000 instead of $300,000\nWhat are NFTs and why are some worth millions?\nFake Banksy NFT sold through artist's website\nOpenSea admits insider trading of NFTs The market in digital art and collectables is now approaching that of the global art trade, according to the Financial Times. The total value of trade for NFTs was estimated to be worth $40.9bn last year according to calculations by blockchain data firm Chainalysis, the paper reported. The figure is probably an underestimate, because only NFTs using the Ethereum blockchain were considered. Last year the global art market was worth $50.1bn, it said. Announcing new funding, OpenSea said it would \"look to bring NFTs to a broad consumer audience this year\" and reduce their \"barriers to entry\". But regulators and critics worry that consumers may not appreciate the risks involved in largely unregulated crypto-asset investments like NFTs. Research by Chainalysis suggested that while many people may collect them, data shows that expert investors make most of the money. Other analysts worry NFT marketplaces are prone to so-called wash-trading where investors sell and then buy back an NFT they own with the aim of boosting demand. The environmental impact of the technology behind NFTs also concerns critics. As with crypto-currency, the record of who owns what NFT is stored on a shared ledger known as the blockchain, a process maintained by thousands of computers worldwide. Keeping those computers running creates a considerable demand for electricity and consequently pollution. ",

            "header": "Electric car sales soar, but chip shortage hits market",
            "content": "Sales of electric vehicles soared last year, but the market as a whole failed to recover from the Covid pandemic. More electric cars were registered in 2021 than in the previous five years combined, according to the Society of Motor Manufacturers and Traders (SMMT). Yet the industry body said much more investment was needed in charging infrastructure. Meanwhile, an acute lack of computer chips left dealers struggling to get hold of many new conventional models. Overall, 2021 was another dismal year for the motor industry. Preliminary figures from the SMMT show that some 1.65m cars new cars were registered. That was a small increase over 2020, when the impact of the first Covid-related lockdowns and dealer closures sent sales plummeting. But it was still the second-worst figure recorded in nearly three decades, and 28% down on its pre-pandemic level. At the beginning of the year, there was a further lockdown, while any hopes of a lasting recovery later on were dashed by a severe shortage of semiconductors - or computer chips. These are critical components in modern cars, being used in areas such as engine management and emissions control, emergency braking, airbags, entertainment systems and navigation. A modern car can use between 1,500 and 3,000 semiconductors. Tesla criticised after opening Xinjiang showroom\nWhat will happen to all the dead car batteries?\nWhy electric cars will take over sooner than you think But outbreaks of Covid-19 in regions where the chips are made, particularly in southeast Asia, caused factory closures that restricted supplies. The motor industry also faced intense competition for the chips that were available from other sectors, particularly the consumer electronics industry. This forced manufacturers to allocate what supplies they had to the most profitable models, as well as to those which helped them meet emissions targets - notably electric and plug-in hybrid cars. Despite the problems affecting the market as a whole, registrations of electric cars rose more than 75%, from 108,000 in 2020 to 191,000 last year. In December, they accounted for one in every four cars sold, while the second-best selling car in the country during the year was Tesla's electric Model 3. But there were significant regional differences in the take-up of electric models. London and the south east accounted for about 20% of all electric and plug-in hybrid cars registered; Wales and northern England just 10% Nevertheless, the overall trend will be welcomed by the government, which plans to ban the sale of new petrol and diesel powered cars by 2030, to help meet commitments on climate change. But the SMMT has warned that reductions in the value of the plug-in car grant could send out mixed messages to consumers. In December, the maximum value of the grant, which is meant to bring down the cost of an electric car, was reduced from £2,500 to £1,500, and the number of eligible models was also narrowed down. \"It's a confusing message,\" said Mike Hawes, chief executive of the SMMT. \"It's a massive ambition to get the entire market to move to meet net zero by 2030/2035. We would argue you need to use every lever at your disposal.\" \"Anything that brings into doubt that commitment doesn't help a consumer who might be wavering.\" The industry body said it is also concerned that while electric vehicle sales are rising rapidly, the number of on-street public charging points is not increasing as quickly. \"There will be more people competing for a much more slowly increasing number of on street chargers,\" explained Mr Hawes. \"We want the user experience to be seamless, to be affordable and to be easy. And we just foresee this being one of the barriers to the consumer take-up of these vehicles that we need across the country.\" But Melanie Shufflebotham, co-founder of the Zap Map website, which lists charging points across the country, disagreed that the rollout of new infrastructure has been too slow. \"Electric vehicles are now the norm,\" she said. \"Sales accelerated throughout 2021 and so did the public charging infrastructure. There are nearly 30,000 public chargers in the UK, an increase of more than a third since the end of 2020.\" \"But we do need charging to keep growing at pace this year to make sure it is simple for the next generation of EV drivers.\" ",

            "header": "Covid: Pre-departure travel tests to be scrapped",
            "content": "The rules on testing are to be eased for people travelling to England, the government has announced, following calls from the travel industry. From 04:00 GMT on Friday, fully vaccinated travellers coming to England will no longer have to take a test before they travel. And from Sunday, rather than taking a PCR test on day two of arrival, they can take a cheaper lateral flow. The rules for self-isolating on arrival will also change. The shake-up was confirmed by Boris Johnson earlier, following calls from travel firms who said the measures were not effective now that Omicron was spreading widely. Under the current rules in force until Friday, all fully-vaccinated travellers over the age of 12 must show proof of a negative test lateral flow or PCR test taken in the two days before coming to the UK. Fully vaccinated people must also pay for a PCR test within two days of arrival and self-isolate while waiting for the result. People who aren't fully vaccinated must currently take PCR tests on both day two and day eight after arriving, and self-isolate for 10 days. But under the new rules: From 04:00 GMT on Friday 7 January, people who are fully vaccinated and those aged under-18 will no longer need to take a test two days before travelling to England from countries outside the UK and the Common Travel Area. On arrival, they will have to take a PCR test but they will no longer have to self-isolate while awaiting the result\nFrom 04:00 GMT on Sunday 9 January they will only have to take a lateral flow test instead of a PCR test on day two. But this test must be bought from a private test provider - free NHS tests are not allowed\nUnvaccinated passengers will need to continue to take a pre-departure test, PCR tests on day two and day eight, and self-isolate for 10 days Prime Minister Boris Johnson said the pre-departure test \"discourages many from travelling for fear of being trapped overseas and incurring significant extra expense\". The announcement comes after airlines said passenger testing was making no real impact, with data last week suggesting one in 25 people in England had the virus. They also said compulsory testing had held back the sector's recovery. Mr Johnson met his cabinet earlier and alongside changes to travel tests, the government has said it will ease Covid testing rules for people without symptoms, who will no longer need to confirm a positive lateral flow test with a PCR. On Tuesday, Mr Johnson said he hoped the country could \"ride out\" the current wave, although he acknowledged parts of the NHS would feel temporarily overwhelmed. That rule change will come into force on 11 January and apply to England only for now. Following the announcement for England, Health Minister for the Welsh government Eluned Morgan said: \"I have today reluctantly agreed to remove the requirements for fully vaccinated travellers and under 18s to take a pre departure test (PDT) and a day 2 PCR test when arriving in the UK.\" Currently, all travellers to the UK aged 12 and over have to show proof of a negative test, which can be a PCR or a lateral flow test, and must be taken up to two days before departure for the UK. They then have to take another test - which this time must be a PCR test - within the first two days after their arrival in the UK. But at the time that rule was brought in a month ago, the number of new cases reported in the UK each day was running between 40,000 and 50,000 - and was only rising relatively slowly because it was almost entirely made up of the Delta variant of Covid. But UK cases have now risen sharply and Omicron is the dominant variant - so airlines can argue that there is no longer any hope of relying on testing to \"keep out Omicron\". Read more. John Wyndham, who is currently planning a third trip to the US for February, said that scrapping pre-departure tests will make him feel unsafe on flights. \"I'm frustrated because pre-departure was the most important as an effective control and also the cheapest test,\" he told the BBC. Mr Wyndham runs a start-up company that is organising marching bands across the world to participate in London Band Week. He went to the US in December along with three colleagues, who paid £212 each for PCR testing. However, he said that the eliminating pre-departure testing will only save him around £30 per person and wasn't worth the added worry about new variants. \"It's bonkers that we could now sit on the plane with someone who has it,\" he said, adding that it would \"worsen what has already been the most stressful travelling of my life\". However, holidaymaker David Hughes welcomed the scrapping of PCR tests before returning to the UK. Currently on holiday in Dubai, the rule change will save his family of 4 around £400 and another removing the Day 2 PCR will also save the family another £400. \"Having returned from a country where there were strict entry requirements and we were tested on arrival I would be very confident that we'll be returning to the UK Covid free,\" he told the BBC. Cancellation fees and no longer having to test before returning would mean significantly less hassle and stress, Mr Hughes added. In response, Mark Tanzer, Chief Executive of ABTA - The Travel Association, said the two announcements were \"potentially very positive\" for the travel sector, but that damage had \"already been done\". \"We now hope to see confidence return as we enter what is usually the peak booking season for summer holidays,\" he added. Steve Heapy, boss of the airline Jet2 and tour operator Jet2 Holidays, also said the timing of the announcement will make a \"huge difference\". Numbers of customers on their website, he said, were already increasing \"exponentially\" after the rule change. Shai Weiss, chief executive of Virgin Atlantic, agreed that the announcement meant customer demand would be boosted in a \"critical booking window\" for the industry. EasyJet chief executive Johan Lundgren also welcomed the news, saying it would make travel \"much simpler and easier\", as customers could now book and travel with \"confidence\". The trade body Airlines UK has argued that continuing the current measures would be financially disastrous for the industry. UK air travel sees huge slump in 2021 due to Covid\nWhere will I need to use a Covid passport?\nWill Omicron stall airlines' recovery in 2022? Ahead of the test changes, Manchester Airports Group (MAG) sent the government research it commissioned, which it claimed shows that pre-departure testing has had little or no impact on the spread of Omicron. It said that passenger numbers at MAG's airports fell by more than 30% after Omicron measures were introduced. Tim Hawkins, chief of staff at MAG, told the BBC's Today programme the research showed there was a \"basis for taking out all tests\" related to international travel, due to the high number of Covid cases in the UK. \"We are beyond the point where international travel restrictions can play a role in managing that peak and if there is no benefit to it then we shouldn't be doing it and we should take those measures out,\" he added. Separately, European airline and tour operator stocks rose on Tuesday amid a rise in investor confidence in the sector. Hargreaves Lansdown analyst Susannah Streeter told Reuters: \"With so many people in the short-term being forced to isolate at home, it's likely many people will be spending the next few weeks browsing travel blogs for inspiration, given there is so much desperation for a holiday.\" A recent report by aviation analytics firm Cirium found that the Covid pandemic triggered a 71% drop in international flights in and out of the UK in 2021.

            "content": "Many vintage BlackBerry phones will stop working reliably after Tuesday as the company turns off support for its operating system and associated services. For journalist Bill Wilson, it means the retirement of a faithful workhorse. \"Is that a Blackberry, I didn't know they were still going?\" has been many a conversation opener over the past decade, and particularly over the past five or six years. From airport security to pubs and restaurants, even in hospital intensive care, strangers have looked on curiously and even asked to hold and look at my Q10 phone with its distinctive qwerty keyboard. But my stock answer of \"yes they are still going\" would now have to add \"but not their classic phones\". Launched in 2013, that particular model, and BlackBerry's phones since then, have faced an increasingly impossible battle as Apple and Samsung set about their battle for global smartphone domination. Hard to believe that in the late 2000s and early 2010s, BlackBerrys were a ubiquitous sight on commuter trains, trams and planes across the UK - as business professionals scrolled through their emails and tap-tapped away their replies. But now, after reports of the demise of BlackBerry's operating system on many previous occasions, it really is the final curtain. For on 4 January, the Canadian firm - which is now a specialist in cyber-security software - is to turn off its BlackBerry OS support. Announcing the termination, BlackBerry thanked \"our many loyal customers and partners over the years\". BlackBerry phones relied for many functions on key services provided by the company not just on the device itself, and with the withdrawal of support these are ending. The company said \"devices running these legacy services and software through either carrier or wi-fi connections will no longer reliably function, including for data, phone calls, SMS and 9-1-1 functionality.\" That includes all smartphones running on BlackBerry 7.1 OS and earlier, the BlackBerry 10 operating system and the tablet-based BlackBerry PlayBook OS. Phones such as my antique Q10 will be affected, though it may remain handy as a back-up for contact numbers. But post-2016 Blackberry-branded phones, which were made under licence by Chinese firm TCL, are unaffected as they use the Android operating system. Over the years it's not just Blackberry phone user numbers that have dwindled, but support and functions have dropped away one by one. Support for many apps, including BBC iPlayer and WhatsApp, was withdrawn from BlackBerry OS devices, and not long ago YouTube stopped working too. Somehow or other I was able to circuitously get the latter two to work again by downloading links from far corners of the planet. Apps have become a non-existent element for users of BlackBerry devices. For example, at the start of the coronavirus pandemic in 2020 I found myself unable to download the various NHS apps, and had to sign in to places manually. Mobile phone museum celebrates ugly and iconic phones\nBlackBerry breaks up with phone-maker TCL\nHow did the qwerty keyboard become so popular? So, why go to all this trouble? In short, it is still great for emails, with five or six different addresses all in one stream. I also love the qwerty keyboard with keys that depress and are not like pressing a hard plank of wood. As phones have become progressively bigger, the BlackBerry still fits beautifully, and fairly lightly, in the hand. It's a feeling with which Ben Wood, an industry analyst for CCS Insight and founder of the Mobile Phone Museum, agrees. \"The dedicated qwerty keyboard was an iconic design,\" he says. \"The devices became so comfortable in people's hands that they developed muscle memory delivering fast and accurate text input.\" Mr Wood says: \"It always makes me smile when I show kids some of the mobile phones of yesterday. \"They are enthralled by the design diversity. I even had a 14 year-old ask me the other day 'why don't they bring keyboards back?' which made me smile.\" It is almost exactly 23 years since BlackBerry launched its 850 phone, and the company soon became the leader in providing emails when out and about on the move. There was also the attraction of BBM - BlackBerry's Instant Messenger service - although this facility attracted unwanted publicity during the riots that swept through many UK cities in 2011. There were outraged cries of protest that the police could not monitor the encrypted nature of BBM messages to find out where looters would strike next. But the models that followed the iconic BlackBerry Bold would face increasing competition from Apple and Android phones. So what happens next? In 2020, TCL's licence ended and was picked up by a firm called Onward Mobility. It promised a 5G BlackBerry running Android for 2021, but nothing emerged. For now I shall try my luck with a second-hand Android Blackberry KeyOne - itself five years old now - (from Canadian eBay this time), and bought long ago in preparation for just this such day. And I shall also hold on to my Q10 - you never know when in the future someone may ask...\"is that an antique BlackBerry?\" ",

            "content": "Former Apprentice winner Tim Campbell says it is a \"great honour\" to be standing in for Lord Sugar's assistant Claude Littner on this year's show. Littner, 72, will be absent from the 16th series of the BBC One business programme following a cycling accident. Campbell, who became the first ever Apprentice in 2005, said returning to the show was like coming \"full circle\". \"It was a great regret when we heard about Claude, who is such a massive part of the franchise,\" he said. \"We're really pleased that he's doing well and he's on the road to recovery.\" Littner's accident occurred last April while riding an electric bike. The 72-year-old injured his right leg so badly that doctors considered amputating it. As a result, he was unable to film The Apprentice, so Campbell was assigned to follow the two teams, along with Lord Sugar's other aide, Karren Brady. Campbell joined Sugar's company Amstrad on a £100,000 salary after winning the first series in 2005. He went on to set up his own digital marketing agency and was made an MBE in 2012. \"It's a great honour to have come full circle,\" Campbell said. \"Having been on the other side of the table I definitely understand what [the candidates] are all going through. And it's a great honour to be working alongside Baroness Brady in assessing these candidates and seeing how they all get on.\" But any candidates who might have been expecting some help from Campbell, as a former contestant, were left disappointed. \"It was very easy not to give hints and tips, because I didn't get any when it was my turn!\" he laughed. The new series of the BBC show, which begins on Thursday, will see 16 entrepreneurs battle it out to win £250,000 worth of investment into their business. Speaking at a virtual press conference ahead of the new series, Lord Sugar paid tribute to the BBC One show's production team for managing to film the show during the Covid pandemic. \"One thing I can tell you is that you will not see one mask throughout the whole of the 12 episodes,\" Lord Sugar said. Regular testing and social distancing were among the measures taken to ensure the series could be filmed safely, in the spring of last year, while many members of the production team wore masks behind the scenes. \"I take my hat off to [executive producer] Paul Broadbent and his team to managing to get this thing done, in very difficult times,\" Lord Sugar said. \"It was a very difficult thing to do. \"Having said that, this shows you how great and resourceful people can be under problems, which is what us British are good at. And the challenge of doing this thing through Covid, we just took it in our stride.\" Covid references loom large in this series, however, with Lord Sugar telling the candidates during the opening episode: \"In this board room, you don't get furloughed, you get fired.\" Baroness Brady told journalists: \"It was a mammoth task in itself keeping everybody safe. That was the priority of the production team and everyone involved. \"There was constant testing, we maintained social distancing where we could, we wore masks when we weren't filming. But Tim and I keep our distance [from the candidates] anyway.\" Viewers will not be disappointed by this year's crop of candidates who, as usual, are not shy about making truly ridiculous statements. Candidate Harry Mahmood, a regional operations manager from the West Midlands, says he hopes to work with Lord Sugar to develop his business and become \"the bad boys of the bath bomb world together\". Alex Short, the owner of a commercial cleaning company in Hertford, says: \"I would compare myself to a Ferrari, shiny on the outside but under the bonnet, there is a lot of fire and I'm coming for you\". Boutique cocktail bar owner Sophie Wilding declares: \"Failure is not an option, winning is part of my DNA.\" Ashkay Thakrar, the owner of a digital marketing company, says his friends \"call me AK47 because I'm a killer salesperson\" and claims that his first word as a new-born was \"profit\". The other candidates on the show include Aaron Willis, a flight operations instructor and ex-RAF member, Akeem Bundu-Kamara, a strategy manger for a financial firm, beauty brand owner Amy Anzel, hotel front of house manager Brittany Carter, sales executive Conor Gilsenan, and mother-of-five Shama Amin. The line-up is completed by Francesca Kennedy Wallbank, a sustainability company owner, Harpreet Kaur, a dessert parlour owner, online pyjama store owner Kathryn Louise Burn, pharmacist Navid Sole, finance manager Nick Showering, and Stephanie Affleck, the owner of an online children's store. For the first time, the BBC has this year scheduled Dragons' Den and The Apprentice to be broadcast on the same evening, one after the other. The fire-breathing investors will be seen in the Den at 20:00 GMT on BBC One, with The Apprentice following an hour later on the same channel. \"I only noticed myself this week on the scheduling that the BBC have decided to play Dragons' Den beforehand. I'm not quite sure what their thinking is, perhaps they're making Thursday business night or something,\" Lord Sugar said. \"I don't know, they don't share these scheduling ideas with me... But I imagine it will be a nice warm-up to The Apprentice. \"There is an argument that says people might get so bored [by Dragons' Den], they might not bother to tune into us afterwards,\" he laughed, before adding hastily: \"That's a joke, Peter Jones, don't take exception to it.\" The BBC said it had no comment to make on the scheduling decision. The Apprentice begins at 21:00 GMT on BBC One on Thursday 6 January. ",

            "header": "Brexit 'still a bit of minefield' for businesses one year on",
            "content": "It's been hard work and \"niggly\" at times, but many businesses in the East of England say they have been able to cope with the first year of Brexit. The BBC has spoken to a few of them. Britain formally left the European Union (EU) and its single market on 1 January 2021 and, since then, all goods entering or leaving the country are subject to border checks and paperwork. After what the government called \"teething problems\" in the first few months, the predicted long delays at ports and mass shortages never really happened. Some companies say they have prospered, but most who trade with the EU agree that things have become more complicated and time-consuming. It has not been plain sailing and the debate about whether Brexit has been a good or bad thing continues. The owner of King's Lynn-based Captain Fawcett, which supplies gentlemen's grooming products around the world, said after some initial hold-ups, exports are up by 34%. Some 78% of Richard Finney's orders go overseas and back in April he had shipments stuck in Spain, Poland and Germany. He said they were held up - sometimes for up to two months - by foreign customs due to the new paperwork requirements. He says that having customs' borders installed where they had not been before meant staff took time to understand the new rules. He says things are now very different, hold-ups are rare and even though he has lost some European business due to customers being put off by the extra paperwork and charges, he has started to find new markets in India, China and further afield and is doing better now than a year ago. As well as a rise in exports, the company has been named a Department of International Trade export champion. \"Those initial worries regarding delays to shipments getting in and out - in the main that is now sorted out,\" he says. \"We are no longer dealing with a single state (the EU) but 26 individual countries with their own nuances and requirements, so it is still a bit of minefield, but I think we've solved it. \"There are still some teething problems but things are a lot better. It is niggly but with the right attitude and the right information it can be overcome.\" Chris Bonnett, who runs the Gardening Express a nursery and mail order plant sales business near Chelmsford in Essex, says he has lost between £250,0000 and £500,000 due to the collapse of the Northern Ireland market. He says that market has all but dried up because couriers are \"very nervous\" about carrying goods over the Irish Sea due to the extra checks associated with the Northern Ireland Protocol. \"They don't want to have a truck held up for paperwork if something's not quite right or if an overzealous customs officer is doing their job, as that would potentially cause hours and hours of delays to thousands of parcels on that lorry,\" he says. At the same time, the company has not lost out financially because people spending more time at home due to lockdowns means the UK market has grown. \"We haven't felt the loss, but it's trade we're not taking [in Northern Ireland] which would allow us to employ more people here in England,\" he says. \"We really would like to have that trade and I'm sure the people of Northern Ireland would really like to buy the goods.\" He adds he feels \"a bit incredulous\" about the whole situation. \"It's ludicrous that we can't send goods within our own country and it really needs someone to grasp the nettle and deal with the situation,\" he says. \"Someone's got to make the hard decisions and stop pussy-footing around because it's gone on for too long already and business is suffering [for] both larger corporations and small businesses like ourselves.\" Lynn Shellfish's first delivery of last year - 9.5kg of shrimp - was held at Rotterdam for five and a half days. It exports more than 90% of the whelks, cockles and shrimp that it processes to Europe and the firm says all of its first few 2021 shipments to Europe were held up at foreign ports due to paperwork issues. But now, the managing director of the King's Lynn company, Stephen Williamson, says lorries are going to Europe every few days without any problems. \"It was rough to start with but we've got used to it now,\" he says. \"We know what we have to do, it's not a terrifying thing anymore. \"Once you know what you're doing and you're doing it three or four times a week then you get used to it.\" An ardent pro-Brexiteer, Mr Williamson says that while the one piece of paper needed before Brexit has turned into about 40 or 50, \"you have to make it work\". \"You have to bend over backwards and jump through all the hoops, but we're still here, we've not lost any business so it's been worth it,\" he says. He still thinks Brexit has been a good thing for Britain and that despite Covid, the economy has performed well against the Eurozone and the US dollar which is \"a fantastic pointer that this country is going to grow\". \"I chose Brexit, I've got to live with it but even after the problems [we've had as a company I know] I haven't made a mistake,\" he says. \"Brexit will be worth it in the long run.\" Chief operating officer for Norfolk Chambers of Commerce, Nova Fairbank, says most businesses have coped with all the new red tape in the first year, but it has been hard. She warns that new paperwork requirements, delayed from last year and introduced on 1 January, could cause problems for firms trading with the EU. \"In the first few weeks there were some significant challenges where businesses were not anticipating having to have certain documents,\" she says. \"They didn't know where to find the information and their EU suppliers were, shall we say, not as helpful as they could have been in supplying the right paperwork.\" She says that while they have \"got to grips with\" the \"significant volume of paperwork\", the 12-month transition period is ending and the paperwork is about to change again. \"Up until now you've been able to get away with not having the correct paperwork on time,\" she says. \"Now you will not be able to move your goods from the EU to the UK without having the correct paperwork. \"It's going to cause a headache for a lot of businesses.\" Find BBC News: East of England on Facebook, Instagram and Twitter.

            "content": "Customers of Nationwide are facing another round of delays on payments after a queuing system was installed by the building society. It said the move was needed to manage the system during a surge in payments on the first working day of the year. Customers experienced payment problems during the festive period, although Nationwide said the latest issue was unconnected. Customers have been expressing their anger on social media. One said the recent run of problems meant the service was \"nothing short of abysmal\". Nationwide customers hit by payment glitch A Nationwide spokeswoman said: \"As a result of extremely high volumes of transactions on the first working day of the year we took the decision to temporarily queue inbound faster payments. \"This has been done to ensure we can manage and process those payments, which were taking much longer than normal due to the numbers received.\" The delays affect a number of payments made digitally to individuals, but Nationwide said bulk payments such as wages, direct debits and standing orders should not be affected. \"We hope to get our systems back to normal and apologise for any inconvenience caused as a result of these delays. All other services are working normally,\" the spokeswoman added. \"Members can continue to use their cards to pay for goods and services, access the internet bank and banking app and withdraw cash from ATMs.\" She urged customers not to try to resend payments, but gave no estimate as to when faster payments would return to their normal speed of about two hours or less to complete. The delays come after various problems affected Nationwide's systems in recent weeks, leaving some people unable to send or receive money, with some waiting for wages at a time of year when they are already financially stretched. The building society said anyone facing charges as a result of late payments should get in touch to discuss their situation. ",

            "header": "UK steel future uncertain without US tariffs deal",
            "content": "UK steel companies have been operating at a significant disadvantage compared to their European rivals since the beginning of 2022. The EU has done a deal with the US, which took effect on 1 January, to allow companies to export steel to the US again without any tariffs. The UK is yet to reach a similar agreement though it is hoping for more talks with America this month. It means British companies still face a 25% tariff on exports to the US. And the effect of the change is already being felt. At a foundry in Chesterfield, raw materials are being melted in a furnace to make cast iron bars. Steel and cast iron are no longer a huge chunk of the British economy but they are about to get a little bit smaller. Because of the US tariffs on products from the UK, United Cast Bar Limited (UCB), the company that runs this foundry, is moving some of its production to a factory in Spain. \"60% of the products we can make here we can also make in Spain,\" says James Brand, managing director of foundries at UCB. \"And our customers don't want that extra 25% cost.\" But if the UK manages to do a deal of its own with the US, will that production come back? \"Probably not,' he says. \"It really depends on how early the deal is done.\" Once US importers get used to consignments arriving from Spain, a new trade pattern will have been established and the way the tariffs have been set up means they can't be avoided if any part of a product originates in the UK. \"It is highly likely we will just leave it over there (in Spain),\" Mr Brand says. \"Lost to the UK completely, then.\" It was President Donald Trump who signed an order in 2018 to introduce the steel tariffs on national security grounds, which he claimed was to help protect US jobs. If the UK government had hoped that Joe Biden's administration would change course quickly, it has been disappointed. Neither public diplomacy nor private negotiation has yet led to any breakthrough. Following Mr Trump's move, both the UK and the EU retaliated with tariffs of their own against US products. But it is the EU that has got a deal done first, to resolve the dispute. That's partly because in trade, size matters. \"They (the EU) are just bigger so they account for more steel exports to the US, and that means there is more interest from US importers in getting it resolved,\" says Soumaya Keynes, Britain economics editor at The Economist. \"And because there is more trade involved with the EU, the retaliation hurts more.\" The EU was also more explicit about how it intended to accelerate retaliation against the American tariffs. The UK was, says Ms Keynes, \"a bit friendlier, a bit chummier, and that could mean the EU had more leverage.\" For the UK government, there is an added complication. There is political concern in Washington about British threats to suspend parts of the post-Brexit deal with the EU on Northern Ireland. The two issues are quite separate, but it is possible that one could delay the other. The government argues that the steel dispute could in fact lead to further complications in Northern Ireland, because of its special status as part of the EU single market for goods. But it is an awkward mix. There is also the question of stepping up UK retaliation against the US tariffs. The government's formal response to a public consultation on further counter-measures has already been delayed, and it cannot be put off forever, Trade secretary Anne-Marie Trevelyan issued a careful warning when she spoke to the BBC last month, after returning from a visit to Washington, \"We had a very frank conversation, and I was very clear that the pressures that we are under to use countervailing measures if we can't solve the problem are becoming more and more acute.\" The government certainly hopes the dispute can be resolved soon, before it gets worse. A solution later this month would be a great relief, and the message from industry is pretty clear. \"Crack on, please,\" says UCB's James Brand. \"Let's get a deal brokered as soon as possible and put us on a level playing field with the rest of Europe.\" It wasn't supposed to be like this. After Brexit, the UK was relying on a closer relationship with the US than it had when it was part of the EU. But in matters of trade, many things are easier said than done. ",

The electric vehicle firm announced it was recalling 356,309 vehicles because of potential rear-view camera issues affecting 2017-2020 Model 3 Teslas. A further 119,009 Model S vehicles will also be recalled because of potential problems with the front trunk, or boot. The total recall figure is almost equivalent to the 500,000 cars Tesla delivered last year, Reuters reports. The BBC has approached Tesla for comment. A safety report, submitted this month, estimates that around 1% of recalled Model 3s may have a defective rear-view camera. Over time \"repeated opening and closing of the trunk lid\" may cause excessive wear to a cable that provides the rear-view camera feed, says a Safety Recall report submitted by Tesla to the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA) in the US on the 21 December. If the wear causes the core of the cable to separate \"the rear-view camera feed is not visible on the centre display\", the report notes. The loss of the rear-view camera display may \"increase the risk of collision\", it adds. The Model S recall involves vehicles manufactured between 2014-2021, some of which may have a problem with a \"secondary latch\" on the front trunk, or boot. In another Safety Recall report, also filed on 21 December, Tesla notes the fault could mean, if the primary latch is inadvertently released, the front trunk \"may open without warning and obstruct the driver's visibility, increasing the risk of a crash\". Around 14% of recalled Model S's may have the defect, the report notes. In both cases, the reports state that \"Tesla is not aware of any crashes, injuries, or deaths\" relating to the potential faults. The latest recall is not the first safety issue to have prompted action from the electric vehicle firm. Last week Tesla agreed to make changes to its Passenger Play feature, which allows games to be played on its touchscreen while the car is in motion. It took action after an investigation was launched by the NHTSA. The feature will now be locked and unusable while the car is moving. ",

            "header": "New home and car insurance rules mean change in prices",
            "content": "Prices paid for home and motor insurance are changing due to new rules coming into effect on 1 January to protect loyal and vulnerable consumers. Anyone renewing their policy will pay no more than they would as a new customer, under regulations set by the Financial Conduct Authority (FCA). That means prices for those who switch regularly will go up, while long-standing customers will pay less. The FCA said the move would save loyal customers £4.2bn over 10 years. Brian Brown, consumer finance expert at market analysts Defaqto, said there was no sign of insurers leaving the market as a result, meaning customers still had plenty of choice of products. The policy is designed to end cases of \"price walking\", which is when a customer is charged more year after year, by staying with the same insurance company - even though their risk is no greater. When announcing its plans, the FCA pointed to an example in which a new customer for home insurance typically paid £130 for a year's cover. But for the same policy, having stayed with the same insurer for five years, that annual premium rose to £238. For motor insurance, new customers paid £285 while people who have been with their provider for more than five years paid £370, according to the FCA's example. The new rules are being brought in by the FCA in the New Year following a super-complaint from Citizens Advice about the loyalty penalty. Those who switched have received the best deals as new customers. Those who stayed loyal were charged more. Around 10 million policies across home and motor insurance are held by people who have been with their provider for five years or more. Insurer 'made money from my loyalty'\nBanks told to stop short-changing loyal savers\nInsurers covering cost of therapy for lonely dogs Matthew Upton, director of policy at Citizens Advice, said: \"Rip-off renewal prices have seen consumers paying over the odds for far too long. No longer can you be exploited just for staying loyal.\" He added that people tended to be at a disadvantage if they were older, on lower incomes, or unable to access the internet. \"We welcome the FCA's bold new rules on home and motor insurance. We now need to see urgent action to protect consumers in the other markets,\" he said. People can still shop around for the best deals, and will need to consider whether the policy matches their requirements. However, premiums charged to all renewing home and private motor insurance customers by their insurance provider cannot be greater than the price they would charge to an equivalent new customer for the equivalent policy. Individual premiums can still be set at different levels depending on factors such as a customer's age, type of vehicle, driving record and history of claims. James Dalton, from the Association of British Insurers, said: \"While the FCA recognises that these changes could lead to price rises for some who shop around regularly, all customers should get fairer outcomes in the UK's competitive home and motor insurance markets.\" In October, the FCA introduced new rules requiring insurers to look more closely at how they offer fair value for consumers. It should also be made easier for consumers to cancel automatic policy renewals, and home and motor insurance firms must report more data to the regulator. ",

            "content": "Frustrated Sofology customers say they have been left without furniture over Christmas after repeated delivery no-shows and \"consistently bad\" customer service. The furniture chain, which is owned by DFS, has been without a chief executive since September, while its managing director resigned in December. Sofology blames supply chain disruption and a new warehouse system. It said there were \"a small number of failed in-day deliveries\". However, dozens of social media posts complain about the company's lack of communication when deliveries fail. Janet Mellor of Oldham was told on three separate occasions this month her new sofa and armchair - which she ordered in July at a cost of £2,500 - would be delivered but nothing materialised. \"I've never known a company as bad,\" she said. When Ms Mellor received emails with the subject line \"Great news your delivery is booked\" including a delivery date, she got rid of her old furniture to make space. \"We've been sat on dining room chairs and so we ordered two deck chairs from Amazon for Christmas. I've totally lost patience with them now. I just want my money back,\" she said. Hearing nothing from the company after each of the failed deliveries, she called their customer care line. \"It's a minimum one hour - sometimes 1.5 hours - until you get to actually speak to somebody,\" she said. Sofology said in a statement that the roll-out of a new warehouse system is now complete and it expects \"a much improved service across every depot enabling us to more consistently meet planned delivery dates\". It said it had been experiencing \"a surge\" in customer calls but added that it had doubled the resources in its customer service teams and is significantly reducing wait times. \"The vast majority of our customers have received their deliveries on time,\" said Sofology. \"But we wholeheartedly apologise to any customers who have been affected by delays or difficulties in reaching our team.\" But when Ms Mellor searched Sofology on Facebook, she found her troubles were far from unique. A group called \"Sofology Angry Customers\" has 3,600 members, 100 of whom joined in the past week. The group has had 630 posts in the past month, according to Facebook data. Other social media users have been expressing their frustrations on Twitter. Jon Hawkes tweeted that it had been a month since Sofology was supposed to deliver his armchair but despite multiple attempts to contact the firm, he'd received no response. He described the company's customer service as \"consistently bad\". The BBC is not responsible for the content of external sites.\nView original tweet on Twitter Many UK retailers have faced supply chain issues caused by a surge in demand after the early coronavirus lockdowns, which led to an imbalance in shipping containers and long backlogs at ports around the world. But an ex-Sofology employee told the BBC that the company failed to deal with the pent-up demand for sofas after Covid lockdowns and when problems at their warehouses emerged they \"buried their heads in the sand\". The former worker, who was a sales representative at Sofology for more than two years, also blamed the company's culture. \"They want everyone to see everything as a positive and you can't question anything otherwise it is seen as negative and you get pushed away despite selling well. Staff aren't listened to with concerns, big bosses feel they alone have all the answers,\" he said. According to statements filed with Companies House, Sofology's managing director Harvey Ainley resigned from the company on 21 December. Its former chief executive Sally Hopson retired at the end of August. Customers say it is Sofology's poor communication that has compounded problems. Tony Sinden of Fife in Scotland ordered a corner suite and a footstool from Sofology at the beginning of October, for £2,898. On November 27, a delivery team arrived at his house but only part of the new suite could fit through his door. Sofology delivery staff told him they were unable to take the unit apart and reassemble it inside. The company said they'd send another team in 24 hours but none came. When Mr Sinden went to a Sofology store to complain, sales staff told him they couldn't help and he'd need to call the company's customer care line. \"I've never come across a situation where you walk into a store and they take no ownership,\" he said. \"I sat on the phone for 2.5 hours to be cut off at caller number four, from 200,\" he says. A Sofology customer service representative emailed Mr Sindon, promising to resolve the matter. And although a delivery team called saying they had his footstool, they knew nothing about the missing part of the corner suite. The footstool then failed to arrive. \"They didn't bother turning up and didn't even bother explaining,\" he said. Sofology, which was bought by the DFS Furniture Group in 2017, has 49 stores across the UK, making it the country's third largest furniture retailer. Its most recent advertising campaign was fronted by the British actress Helena Bonham-Carter and in the past, Hollywood actor Owen Wilson also featured in its adverts. Its parent company, DFS reported record sales of £1bn for the year to 27 June, up from £724.5m. Sofology contributed £214.6m to total revenue, compared to £181.7m in the previous year. The financial report said Sofology \"is continuing to perform well… despite headwinds of shipping delays and foam disruption\", adding it plans to add up to 20 more Sofology showrooms in the medium term. The statement provided by the firm said: \"Sofology is in good financial health\". ",

            "content": "A brewery boss said the sector had lost about 50% of its Christmas custom amid concerns over the Omicron variant. Andy Wood, chief executive of Adnams, said the hospitality industry was facing the \"economic equivalent of long Covid\". The brewery, which is based in Southwold, Suffolk, owns 50 pubs and hotels and supplies many others. Mr Wood urged the government to provide the industry with \"clarity and consistency\". \"We need that so we can rebuild consumer confidence but also have the confidence ourselves so we can invest in our businesses again,\" he said. Speaking on BBC Radio 4's Today programme, Mr Wood described the festive season as a \"lifeline\" that helped the hospitality sector through \"the dark months of January, February and March\". \"There is going to need to be government support,\" he said. \"We have lost most of Christmas where the industry usually makes cash that sees it through January, February and March. \"The coffers are empty. This is an industry that has been in and out of lockdown and restrictions for 22 months now - it really hasn't had a chance to rebuild profits and loss accounts and balance sheets. \"It is suffering the economic equivalent of long Covid.\" Mr Wood said to help the sector in the short-term the government could continue with the VAT reduction, while in the long-term it could look at \"structural realignment of business rates\". He said there had been a 50% drop in visitors to pubs and hotels after the chief medical officer for England, Prof Chris Whitty, urged people to be cautious about socialising. A HM Treasury spokesperson said: \"We've supported people's jobs and incomes throughout the pandemic through our £400bn package of support, and will continue to do so through our additional £1bn support package for the hospitality and leisure sector. \"Hospitality businesses are also still benefitting from a 75% cut in business rates over the year, reduced VAT, eviction protection, government-backed loans, Time to Pay and our reintroduced Statutory Sick Pay Rebate Scheme.\" Find BBC News: East of England on Facebook, Instagram and Twitter.

            "content": "A more \"efficient and responsive\" civil service would help the Isle of Man's economy proposer in the wake of Covid-19, the Chamber of Commerce has said. Chamber president Kristan McDonald said the public sector needed to follow the private sector in changing its practices to reduce bureaucracy . Mr McDonald described the government's plans to overhaul departments and how they operate as a \"very good vision\". However, he said a \"change in culture\" was needed for it to succeed. More than 500 businesses are registered with the chamber, which has lobbied politicians on issues like regulation, staffing issues and financial support. Mr McDonald, who was appointed president in September, said the private sector had transformed in response to \"technology changes, demographic change and the pandemic\". \"We need the civil service to do the same thing as well\", he said, while praising the government's overall response during the pandemic. While he accepted increased oversight was needed \"when you are dealing with public money\", he argued a \"risk averse\" attitude needed to change. \"The only way that the island is going to be able to prosper is to have a responsive political system, and a responsive civil service that can react to those changes,\" he added. More than £100m was paid out by Treasury during the 2020-2021 financial year to support businesses and workers through the pandemic. An additional £9m was recently made available for sectors like catering, lifestyle, hospitality and non-essential retail over the winter period. Reflecting on the impact of Covid-19, Mr McDonald said the island's economy was in a \"better position\" than other countries, but warned it was a \"very mixed picture\", with the visitor economy \"incredibly badly hit\". The latest government employment figures show catering, tourism and retail are three of the sectors with the largest number of vacancies. Mr McDonald said interest in those \"traditional entry level\" jobs had been eroded as Manx students chose not to return to the island, while those who do no longer want to work \"in those sorts of roles\". Despite Covid's impact on customer-facing sectors, global moves towards remote working for traditionally office-based workers could \"play in our favour\", he said. However, attracting and retaining those staff would come down to helping them on arrival, something he said the chamber continued to discuss with the government. A shortage of suitable housing and the island's \"crazy\" rental market were barriers that could stop \"people coming over to the island, increasing our population, and filling in some of those skills shortages\", he said. Making accommodation easily available as a \"landing pad\" in the short term was one step that could be taken to help persuade more people to relocate, he added.

            "content": "Riot Games, the studio best known for League of Legends, has agreed to pay $100m (£74.3m) to settle a 2018 class-action gender discrimination case. The settlement will \"remedy violations against approximately 1,065 women employees and 1,300 women contract workers\", California's Department of Fair Employment & Housing (DFEH) wrote. DFEH said the firm engaged in \"systemic sex discrimination and harassment\". Riot Games said it must \"take responsibility for the past\". The company will pay $80m (£59m) to members of the class action suit and about $20m (£15m) will cover legal costs. The 2018 case followed investigations by the Los Angeles Times and the news website Kotaku. According to the original complaint against the company, Riot was accused of fostering a \"bro culture\" and faced a range of allegations. These included that women had been sexually objectified, with an email chain that rated the company's \"hottest women employees\", and that unsolicited images of male genitalia had been shown to workers by their bosses and colleagues. As part of the settlement, Riot agreed to workplace reforms, independent expert analysis of its pay, hiring, and promotion practices, and to be monitored for instances of sexual harassment and \"retaliation\" at its California offices for three years. The company must also set aside $18m (13.2m) to fund diversity, equity and inclusion programmes and create 40 full-time positions in engineering, quality assurance or art-design roles for its former contract workers. DFEH Director Kevin Kish wrote that, if accepted by the court, the settlement would lead to lasting change at Riot Games and \"send the message that all industries in California, including the gaming industry, must provide equal pay and workplaces free from discrimination and harassment\". Riot had initially agreed to settle the case for $10m in 2019, but the DFEH and another agency had blocked the deal arguing that the amount to which victims were entitled was much higher. The company said it had to face the fact that it hadn't always lived up to its values, telling the Washington Post: \"While we're proud of how far we've come since 2018, we must also take responsibility for the past\". \"We hope that this settlement properly acknowledges those who had negative experiences at Riot.\" In a letter to staff, published online, Riot's executive team said the settlement was, \"the right thing to do, for both the company and those whose experiences at Riot fell short of our standards and values\". The company told the BBC that since 2018 it had made improvements across the workplace, including hiring its first chief people officer and its first chief diversity officer, rewriting its values, mandating new training programmes and enlarging its diversity and inclusion team. Riot Games is not the only prominent games firm to face questions about workplace culture. The DFEH is also taking action against Activision Blizzard, the company behind the games World of Warcraft, Overwatch and Call of Duty. Activision Blizzard recently reached an $18m (£13.2m) settlement with the US Equal Employment Opportunity Commission (EEOC) over claims of sexual discrimination and harassment. ",

She just wanted another one.\" That's when the Echo speaker suggested partaking in the challenge that it had \"found on the web\". The dangerous activity, known as \"the penny challenge\", began circulating on TikTok and other social media websites about a year ago.

Ms Livdahl tweeted that she intervened, yelling: \"No, Alexa, no!\" However, she said her daughter was \"too smart to do something like that\". Amazon told the BBC in a statement that it had updated Alexa to prevent the assistant recommending such activity in the future. \"Customer trust is at the centre of everything we do and Alexa is designed to provide accurate, relevant, and helpful information to customers,\" said Amazon in a statement. \"As soon as we became aware of this error, we took swift action to fix it.\" ",

            "content": "\"No amount of money will cover what we've been through,\" said Lorraine Williams. She - along with Noel Thomas - was one of 72 former postmasters and postmistresses who had convictions thrown out by the courts this year. The two both ran post offices on Anglesey, and both found themselves wrongly accused of stealing cash. They had been caught up in what has become known as the Post Office Horizon scandal. Lorraine was handed a year-long suspended sentence and ordered to carry out 200 hours of unpaid work back in 2012. Noel fared worse - he was given a nine-month jail term. But looking back at the year they were finally exonerated of any wrong, their victory remains bittersweet. \"Our names were cleared in April, but it's still ongoing - we're still fighting,\" said Lorraine. \"I'm still a bit angry, personally, for what they have put us through,\" added Lorraine. 'Strange 15 years' for postmaster\nPost office scandal: 'I forgot how to laugh' She had been a lynchpin in the small community of Llandaniel Fab when she first took up a role as a sub-postmistress, alongside her work as a warden on an estate for the elderly. Eleven years ago, her world began to fall apart after reporting electrical problems with the Horizon computer over Christmas. Within weeks the computer showed money and stock was missing. In June 2011, Post Office lawyers arrived to tell her £14,600 was missing. \"They were saying 'it is only happening to you - you were alone - nothing like this has every happened before,\" she explained. \"So you believed them. You were one little person and they were a big company, and you just believed them.\" What is the Horizon saga all about? In 2012, on legal advice Lorraine pleaded guilty to false accounting in a desperate bid to stay out of jail. She lost her jobs, her home tied to the elderly warden role and had to take out a second mortgage to repay the Post Office - money she had never taken. But she was not the only one on the island who lived through the experience, despite what she was told. Six years earlier in Gaerwen, Noel Thomas faced accusations over £48,000 alleged to be missing. Again, he had been advised to plead guilty and throw himself on the mercy of the court - but he could not escape a prison term. \"David fighting Goliath, wasn't it?\" remarked Noel, now 75. \"On your own, you had no chance. \"Having worked for the Post Office for 42 years, you wouldn't believe the institution you gave your life to would treat you this way.\" But Lorraine and Noel were not on their own, it turns out. Up and down the UK, those facing claims of theft and false bookkeeping were beginning to talk to each other. A pattern emerged - and at the centre of it all, the Horizon computer systems. It led to a group of 550 staff taking a group legal case against the Post Office, including one of the main claimants being Llandudno postmaster Alan Bates. In December 2019, the Post Office was told to pay £58m to settle the dispute - and paving the way for Lorraine and Noel's convictions to be overturned. Then in December this year, the UK government confirmed it would pick up the bill to compensate those dragged through criminal prosecutions. The Post Office's chief executive, Nick Read, said that decision could not \"change the past\", but it was \"right that meaningful compensation is provided to victims of the Horizon scandal as fast as possible\". He said \"many former postmasters have waited a long time for justice\" and the compensation for those wrongly convicted \"recognises the impact on the lives of those affected\". Cleared: 'The first thing I did was cry'\nWidow: 'I'll never forgive them'\nPost Office scandal victim missed seeing dying father Noel has had a £100,000 interim payment, but said he remained bitter about his experiences over the past 16 years. He said he wanted those responsible to be held to account. \"Take their money off them, that's what you want to do,\" he said. \"Make them feel like the 500 or so that have been involved. Make them feel the same. Make them penniless, if you like, and see what they feel like, going through what we went through.\" A judge-led inquiry into what happened is already under way, and is expected to step up a gear in the new year. \"It's still ongoing isn't it. Me, personally, I just want it over with,\" said Lorraine. \"It's been a horrendous nearly 11 years now.

            "content": "An ice cream company is celebrating 100 years of producing the sweet treat in the city where it was founded. Christmas Aldous began making ice cream in Norwich in 1921, selling his products under the name Aldous' Ices. His recipe is still being used by Lakenham Creamery, which acquired the company in the 1990s. Mr Aldous's granddaughter said it was \"delightful\" to see his much-loved flavours still being enjoyed and sold from a stall at the city's market. Joan Thorndyke's grandfather Christmas Aldous was named after the day he was born - 25 December 1901. Now 76, she recalls being doted on as she was his first grandchild. \"I always had ice cream - I had a lot of tonsillitis and ice cream is in my blood - even now I will rush out when I hear the chimes of an ice cream van - it doesn't matter what the weather is like,\" Mrs Thorndyke said. Her grandfather swapped selling coal for ice cream in 1921. She could not recall where the recipe came from, but said: \"I think he saw some money in it.\" His motorcycle \"trike\" had a sidecar and he rang a hand bell, which she still has to this day. In the early days they made just vanilla and strawberry, with chocolate being added later. But there were always milk lollies in lots of flavours, like lime, she recalled. The popular creamy pops were brought back to celebrate the 100th anniversary of the company this year. Recalling her grandparents, Mrs Thorndyke said: \"I know they struggled in the early years, and my nan, Mary, worked her socks off to get the vans ready for the rounds. \"But my grandfather built the company up very well.\" Aldous' Ices were well-known in the city and became a regular fixture at Norwich Market - there is still a stall there to this day. Mary and Christmas had three children, but Joan said Mr Aldous left the family in the 1950s and the company was passed on to his two sons, Ronnie and Chris. Mr Aldous died in 1984.

            "content": "Shopping footfall in Scotland was 48% below Boxing Day 2019, before the pandemic. That was a steeper fall than any region of England, where footfall was down 40%. However, it was more than a three-fold increase on Boxing Day last year in Scotland, with lockdown restrictions being reintroduced. Across the UK, suburban and smaller towns did better for shopping activity, while shopping malls did least well. Apart from the risk of Covid infection, other reasons for the low figures include some shops choosing to close to give staff a further day off, and lower numbers for a Sunday. On Monday morning, shopper footfall on Scottish high streets and at retail centres was down by 38% on the levels seen two days after Christmas in 2019. That is a slightly larger drop than the data, from Springboard retail consultancy, for the whole UK shows. Early indications are that people have returned in larger numbers to retail parks to restock groceries following Christmas, while high streets and shopping malls have taken a bigger hit from consumer caution about Covid infection. At Braehead shopping centre in Renfrewshire, some keen shoppers queued up before dawn to hit the sales. The centre said about 200 shoppers waited from 05:30 for Next and JD Sports to open their doors. ",

            "content": "The number of people taking advantage of post-Christmas sales on Monday fell by 32% compared with 2019, new data shows, amid persistent Covid concerns. Retail analyst Springboard said footfall figures were better than Boxing Day. But popular shopping destinations such as central London saw a drop caused in part by disruption to rail services. Shoppers chose to visit retail parks on Monday, but footfall there was still down 7.2% from pre-pandemic levels. That contrasted with a sharp drop in footfall on High Streets, down 40.1% on 2019, and in shopping centres, which recorded a 38.8% decline. \"The greater attraction of retail parks is in part likely to be a result of shoppers restocking groceries following the weekend's festivities,\" said Diane Wehrle, insights director at Springboard. It is a reversal of the trend seen on Boxing Day when more people shopped on High Streets than in retail parks. However, overall Boxing Day footfall figures were far lower than pre-Covid levels. No new England Covid rules to be announced on Monday\nHow Covid disrupted our Christmas toy deliveries\nShoppers avoid city centres on Christmas Eve Across the UK, Springboard said High Streets saw footfall drop on Boxing Day by 37.7% compared with 2019. Retail parks recorded a 40.2% decline in footfall while there was a sharper 48.4% drop in shopping centres. Springboard said footfall declined on Boxing Day due to fears over Covid, as well as the fact the traditional start of post-Christmas sales fell on a Sunday this year and some big name stores opted to stay closed. Companies including Next, John Lewis and M&S decided to shut on Boxing Day to give staff a longer Christmas break, though they launched their sales online. On Monday, footfall across all UK regions declined with the sharpest drop in Wales, where it fell by 40.3%. Wales introduced tighter Covid restrictions on 26 December, including limiting the number of people who can meet in pubs, cinemas and restaurants to groups of no more than six people. Scotland and Northern Ireland also brought in similar rules from Monday. In Scotland, footfall in shops dropped by 33.3% while in Northern Ireland it fell by 36.6%. Overall, shopping numbers in England fell by 31.1%, according to Springboard. In London, footfall plunged by 50% compared with the same day in 2019, a much sharper drop than in other areas of the UK. Ms Wehrle said: \"Footfall is weaker in central London than in large city centres elsewhere in the UK, which in part is likely to be a result of cancellations of trains restricting shoppers' ability to get into the capital.\" But Jace Tyrrell, chief executive of the West End Company, which represents shops, hotels and restaurants in central London, told the BBC: \"We are still dealing with Covid and we haven't got international tourists here so it is going to be muted for some time [for] customers coming into the West End.\" A VERY BRITISH SCANDAL: One of the most notorious and brutal legal cases of the 20th century\nA STUNNING WINTER WALK: Shepherdess Amanda Owen takes us through the Yorkshire Dales ",

            "content": "Fishing and coastal communities are to benefit from a £75m funding boost, the UK government has announced. It said the money would be used to modernise UK ports and processing facilities and create jobs. Industry bodies welcomed the investment and said the sector had faced challenges since Brexit. The Scottish government criticised the move, and said as fishing is devolved it should be for Scottish ministers to decide where investment goes. Announcing the funding, the UK government said it would strengthen the sector's ability to land more fish in the UK and take them to market faster. Specifically, it would go towards better infrastructure, strengthened supply chains, new jobs and an investment in skills. Why is there a Brexit fishing row?\nBrexit- UK 'to keep more of its fish'\nWho really owns UK fishing rights? Since Brexit, the industry has faced many challenges. Because the UK is out of the EU's single market, British fish exports to the EU are now subject to new customs and veterinary checks which has caused disruption and delay. Without free access to European recruitment, some businesses have struggled to find labour. And tensions have been growing between the UK and France, as both sides try to sort out the politically-charged matter of how to agree fishing rights after Brexit. Almost a year since the end of the post-Brexit transition period, the UK government's environment secretary George Eustice insisted \"a positive picture\" was emerging for the fishing industry, despite the difficulties the sector has reported. He said £65m would go to modernising ports and harbours, and to increase capacity and efficiency at processing facilities. Projects across the UK will be asked to compete for a share of the funding, with priority going to those that reduce carbon emissions. A £10m fund will encourage new entrants into the sector, and train and upskill those already working in it. Mr Eustice added: \"We are committed to levelling up coastal communities across the UK, and this marks a period of rejuvenation for our fishing industry.\" UK government minister for Scotland Malcolm Offord said the money represented a \"massive boost for the industry\". Mr Offord said the government was engaging with Scotland's fish and seafood sector: \"We are listening to concerns and we are acting upon them for the benefit of business owners, workers and Scotland's wider coastal communities.\" He said last year the UK government had maintained the fisheries funding of £42.2m to the Scottish government, which it would previously have received from the EU. While the Scottish government said the investment was welcomed, it criticised the UK government for spending in an area devolved to Scottish ministers. Rural Affairs Secretary Mairi Gougeon said: \"It is for Scottish ministers, accountable to Scottish Parliament, to make decisions about how marine and fisheries funding is spent in line with our priorities. She said the UK government was presenting the money \"as a solution to all the industry's challenges\" whereas \"in truth, the botched Brexit deal means a reduction in quota available for Scottish vessels\". Ms Gougeon said instead there would be \"confusion, duplication and inefficient use of public money,\" and that the money should have been directed to the Scottish government to allocate. Seafood Scotland, the national trade and marketing body for the industry, said the funding could help with \"the ongoing fallout from Brexit\". Chief executive Donna Fordyce said: \"We welcome this latest release of funding, promised by the government a year ago, and await with interest the detail around how Scottish businesses can access it. \"Grants will help deal with the ongoing fallout from Brexit, including crippling labour issues which investment in automation may begin to ease, but only if funds are distributed equitably.\" The Communities Inshore Fisheries Alliance said investment was needed to \"significantly upgrade many port facilities around the country\". The alliance's Elaine Whyte said the most significant share must go to the fishing communities with the poorest facilities where there is the most scope for impact. \"Currently some ports don't even have basic facilities such as ice provisions, and this greatly impedes their very real potential,\" she said. Ms Whyte continued: \"Our plea is that the bureaucracy is manageable and takes account not only of current capacity issues and limitations, but also encompasses a fair future vision for our coastal communities.\" ",

Tighter Covid restrictions and fears about the Omicron variant have meant a sharp drop in trade for many firms. Ian Fountain, of Cab Smart in Ipswich, said: \"Independent cab companies need to remain and flourish but at the moment [they are] not and won't if we don't get the support that's needed.\" The Treasury said a range of support measures were already in place. Cab Smart said the number of its vehicles working each day had fallen from 88 before the pandemic to just 10. Mr Fountain said many News Year's Eve events and parties had been cancelled, meaning he was only running a quarter of the normal number of cars over the festive period. He said: \"It is important that cab companies remain out on the road.\" Driver David Jennings said drivers were losing money if they had to isolate, since they had \"still got their outgoings of their cars, their leases, the council fees, all of those expenditures, and they're are getting zero income\". Last week, the government said people infected with Covid in England could stop self-isolating after seven, rather than 10 days, if they twice tested negative in the later stages. Health Secretary Sajid Javid said the measure would minimise disruption caused by the rapid spread of Omicron.

She said there was £100m in additional grant funding for councils to distribute to businesses most in need in their areas. The Statutory Sick Pay Rebate Scheme is also being reintroduced, meaning business with fewer than 250 employees can claim money to cover sick pay for employees affected by Covid. The spokeswoman said the Treasury was providing other support for businesses, such as protection from eviction until March and the Recovery Loan Scheme would be available until June.

            "header": "Cities start to attract property buyers again",
            "content": "Prospective property buyers have returned to cities, with flats the most highly in demand during the autumn, according to property portal Rightmove. The UK housing market was relatively immune to the economic effects of Covid, with demand and price rises remaining high throughout the crisis. This was driven by the race for space, with buyers attracted by larger, coastal or rural properties. But as workers returned to offices, interest in apartments revived. However, this is not a return to the pre-pandemic property market. Rightmove says there has been a long-term shift with buyers willing to pay more for space and privacy. That means the gap in asking prices between detached and semi-detached homes has been stretched. In October, the typical asking price for a detached house was 76% higher than a semi-detached, compared with 70% in March 2020. Prospective buyers have also widened their searches by an average of 50 sq km, perhaps willing to move slightly further away from transport links and High Streets as they spend more time working and entertaining themselves at home. \"The pandemic redefined the role of the home and placed new emphasis on its importance, and people looked for more room in order to work, exercise, and often teach under one roof,\" said Tim Bannister, who works in property data at Rightmove. \"While we know from our data that people really care about people and their local community, the pandemic also made us more conscious of our personal space.\" There was a surge in buyers in 2020, as people reassessed where and how they wanted to live. Government support through stamp duty holidays, as well as historically low mortgage rates, also encouraged many people to move, or bring forward future plans to relocate. The biggest demand, and subsequent rise in prices, were for houses in outer city or countryside locations. There were concerns in some areas that locals were being priced out of the market as a result. The epicentre of Britain's house price boom\nYoung and low paid 'priced out' of tourist areas At the same time, many flat owners were struggling to sell as a result of the cladding crisis, following the tragic fire at Grenfell Tower. City centres had become less attractive places to live for those who were not going into an office, or - during the height of the pandemic - were unable to socialise or enjoy the entertainment attractions of urban centres. As workplaces and venues reopened - before the onset of the Omicron variant - there was a shift in buyer preferences, according to Rightmove. The slowest rise in prices over the last year was for flats, and demand was much lower than for houses, especially those with gardens. By the autumn, flats had moved to the top of the list among prospective buyers to become the most in-demand type of property. Mr Bannister said demand to live in London and other major cities had been restored faster than anticipated, as employers encouraged people to return to their desks, at least through a hybrid working model. The market may still be affected by the pandemic and its impact on jobs and the wider economy. The analysis is also based on averages, but local housing markets, demand and property prices can be affected by a host of factors ranging from the success of local schools to roads and new development.

Pubs, he said, rely on takings from December to help them through the quieter months of January and February but, without that cushion or any financial support, many may have to \"look at closing for an amount of time or limiting their hours\". \"The pubs aren't getting enough notice with all these changes, they could change again next week,\" he said, \"We just want clarification really of what is going on almost long term, I know the politicians and scientists don't know long term but it would just be nice to have a little bit more notice of what is going on because it could change again in a couple of days.\" Mark Jones, at the Stanton House Inn, Chirk, in Wrexham, has just recovered from Covid-19 and said after having the virus he can understand restrictions coming in. But the move will \"hinder\" the business which is half a mile from the border with England, he said, and added having differing restrictions in businesses just minutes away has an impact on trade. \"It has been very quiet in the build up to Christmas, the government is telling people not to mix and they are listening but trade-wise it is just like ordinary days, I can't believe it is Christmas on Saturday,\" he said. \"It is as bad as last year when we were shut down but now we're not getting the grants.\" Having to police the new restrictions also creates problems for the business at a time when they are understaffed due to workers having to isolate themselves, he said. \"They might as well shut us down now down and open us up when it is right to do so and we don't have to follow the rules.\" John Matthews, 63, has run The Dukes Arms in Presteigne, a town classed as Powys but which is near the border with Herefordshire, for 32 years. \"With the way things are doing there won't be a 33rd,\" he said. He said trade has already dropped in the pub with people \"frightened to death\" over the latest news surrounding coronavirus. \"Christmas going to be a disaster,\" he said. \"In the pub I've got three fires going and only three customers. \"Usually Christmas Eve and New Years Eve we are absolutely packed, but I think we might just have a handful because a lot of people aren't coming out, the majority of customers are going to stay home, and that's the reality.\" Mr Matthews said abiding to the new rules will be \"another expense\". \"We have to get all the Perspex again, all the signage, do this track and trace, but we don't get any assistance at all off the government..it is totally ridiculous,\" he added. \"For young licensees, the young people working behind bars, they are going to suffer far more, job wise and that.\" Follow BBC West Midlands on Facebook, Twitter and Instagram.

            "header": "November car production hits lowest level since 1984",
            "content": "UK car production in November hit its lowest level since 1984 as Covid continued to affect supply chains, a motoring industry group has said. Output fell by 28.7% to 75,756 units, marking the fifth consecutive month of decline, the Society of Motor Manufacturers and Traders (SMMT) said. It called the figures \"incredibly worrying\", blaming a continuing shortage of semiconductors. The start of full Brexit customs controls could also hit firms, it said. The UK has been short of semiconductors - which are commonly used components in cars - for the past year. Under Covid restrictions, Asian factories have struggled to keep up with demand as economies have reopened. SMMT boss Mike Hawes said the problem was \"likely to affect the sector throughout next year\", and called for more government support. He added the industry was as prepared as it could be for the start of full EU customs checks from 1 January, but warned any delays arising \"from ill-prepared freight or systems will place further stress on businesses\". \"Should any problems arise, contingency measures must be implemented immediately to keep cross border trade flowing smoothly,\" he said. Chip shortage could last into 2023, says car boss In September the UK delayed implementing post-Brexit checks on food and farming imports to England, Scotland and Wales until 1 January 2022. Checks on goods going the other way were also postponed until the same date. One highlight of the November figures was that electric cars continued to grow their share of overall production. Electric, plug-in hybrid and hybrid cars accounted for 32.7% of all cars made last month, the SMMT said. Battery electric vehicle output, in particular, grew by 52.9% to 10,359 units, hitting a new high of 13.7% of all production - more than double the level a year ago. ",

            "header": "‘It feels like gyms are being completely ignored’",
            "content": "Struggling gyms, sports centres and fitness firms have said they feel left out of the government's latest Covid support package. Under plans announced on Tuesday, hospitality and leisure firms can apply for grants of up to £6,000 per premises to deal with a collapse in confidence caused by the Omicron variant. But fitness firms were given no targeted support. They will have to continue to apply for discretionary grants from councils. \"It feels we are being completely ignored and it's heart-breaking,\" said Sandy Macaskill, co-founder of Barry's UK, a gym chain which has eight UK sites. Since \"Plan B\" measures were introduced in England, with people advised to work from home where they can, Mr Macaskill has had to close three of his London sites temporarily because of low footfall. Covid grants a start but more help needed, say firms\nSunak sets out £1bn fund for Covid-hit businesses\nNo new Covid curbs yet but we rule nothing out - PM Takings are down almost 60% across the business compared with pre-pandemic levels. And at one Barry's UK studio in east London, fewer than 100 people visit per day, compared to 500 pre-pandemic. \"People aren't going into work in areas like Canary Wharf, so it doesn't make financial sense to run classes there,\" he told the BBC. \"The government genuinely doesn't understand the devastating impact on our sector.\" Leisure trade group UKactive estimates the sector has already lost more than £200m in revenues because of Omicron. It has called for additional support, such as a lower VAT rate in line with other sectors and the reintroduction of the furlough scheme. It also believes gyms, leisure centres and fitness firms should have been offered the targeted grants being provided to struggling hospitality firms. \"It is vital that the government does not take our sector for granted and provides the required support for our members,\" boss Huw Edwards said. \"Gyms, pools, studios and leisure centres are dealing with a major loss in footfall and are facing the prospect of a decline in new members this January.\" Even if fitness businesses had been included in the chancellor's £6,000 grant funding, Mr Macaskill said this would have been \"measly\", totalling less than a day's worth of revenue at one of the Barry's UK studios. Mr Macaskill is also worried about the prospect of a January lockdown to try to stem the spread of Omicron. A quarter of all new joiners to gyms and leisure centres sign up in January and February, according to UKactive. A decline in footfall this month has also worried Ashton Turner, who runs Evolve 353, an independent gym in Parsons Green, London. Since the advice to work from home, the gym has been running at 30% capacity and Mr Turner was shocked that he had not had any inquiries for New Year joiners. He also has concerns about what further restrictions in January might mean, particularly after last year's lockdown. \"We would seriously struggle to run and I'd have to let staff go,\" he said. Pre-pandemic the gym had 147 members, which fell to 80 after the third lockdown, but despite a steady recovery since then, it only has 105 now. Many of its members are NHS staff and \"really depend\" on the gym for their training and mental health, Mr Ashton said. It's a similar story for Simply Gym, which runs four sites in Wales and two in England. It has also seen a significant drop in attendance at a time when membership levels are still not back at pre-pandemic levels. \"The challenge is if we are open, but people are too worried to visit in key January and February trading months,\" said Simply Gym's chief executive, Richard Proctor. Gyms are able to apply for grants from their local authorities, but Mr Proctor said this had been \"inconsistent\" in the past, with funding requests turned down by some local authorities. Mr Proctor said that losing sales in January would put the business's recovery back by up to 12 months. He's already had to put new site acquisitions on hold while the company focuses on survival. \"The long term damage to public confidence is an ongoing killer,\" he added. Fitness sector group the Chartered Institute for the Management of Sport and Physical Activity (Cimspa) urged the Chancellor to \"rapidly rethink\" the current funding and provide a \"bespoke package of support\". \"In the middle of a national health crisis, and in the midst of winter, it is frankly staggering that the government does not recognise the value of a sector that helps to keep the nation physically and mentally fit and employs hundreds of thousands of people,\" chief executive Tara Dillon said. A Treasury spokesperson said the government understood that gyms and sports centres might be hit by Omicron, \"which is why we announced £100m in additional grants funding for councils to distribute to businesses most in need in their areas\". \"This takes the total amount of available unspent grants funding to £350m and comes on top of 75% business rates relief over the year, the recovery loan scheme, Time to Pay and the reintroduced Statutory Sick Pay Rebate Scheme.\" ",

            "content": "Businesses in the hospitality industry hit by customers' renewed concerns over Covid have said a new weekly grant of up to £6,000 is not enough. Earlier this week, Chancellor Rishi Sunak announced a £1bn fund allowing firms to apply for a cash injection. But a pub owner in North Lincolnshire said his firm was losing \"a lot more\" than £6,000 each week. Meanwhile, other food businesses have called for \"clarity\" and for the furlough scheme to be reinstated. Many hospitality and leisure firms have been hit by a collapse in bookings and reduced footfall due to people's fears over the spread of the Omicron variant. Owners of restaurants, bars, cinemas and theatres can apply for a cash grant of up to £6,000 every week for each of their premises, Mr Sunak said on Tuesday. Slawek Mikolajczyk, owner of The Hope and Anchor Pub in South Ferriby, said \"any help\" was welcome, however he asked: \"It's £6,000. How far is that going to go?\" \"We'll see, but we are losing a lot more than that in one week. So it's appreciated, but I think they should do a lot more...Definitely it doesn't go far enough,\" he said. Mr Mikolajczyk added that his pub had suffered \"up to 60%\" of booking cancellations in the past year and the grant would \"probably cover some of the cancellations for this week and that's it.\" \"We thought we were going to be open as normal, so we employed a few more staff just to be ready. Unfortunately, customers are scared so they're just cancelling and there's not much we can do apart from asking customers to buy a voucher to see us next year,\" he said. Crystal Marinas, who runs The Black Horse pub near Spalding, Lincolnshire, said she was concerned the family firm would not get the full £6,000 of aid because the rateable value of the small business was under £15,000. \"It feels a bit like a plaster, when actually right now we could do with a bandage and a great big hug,\" she said. \"The trade isn't there. We've spent a lot of money getting it ready, then the cancellations come in and we haven't had the turnover.\" Echoing Mr Mikolajczyk, Ms Marinas said she also had monthly running costs far exceeding the £6,000 funding. \"We've already got huge bills now that need paying but we don't know how we're going to pay them. When we don't get the bums on seats it's truly heart-breaking. \"Of course, anything is better than nothing - but we don't know how long we've got to make that [grant] last.\" Meanwhile, food businesses in Leeds said there was mixed government messaging, with one calling for \"clarity and a clear plan\". Valerie Kolat, who runs the Dapur Malaysia restaurant in Chapel Allerton, said: \"Good they have stepped up to help, but really disappointed with the way it's being handled. The lack of clarity and the never-ending leaks is quite torturous.\" She added her restaurant had seen \"just six months of 'normal' trading\" since it opened in August 2019. Street food vendor Jamie Ooi, who owns Little Bao Boy in Leeds, called for the furlough scheme to be \"reinstated to fully support us\". \"The up-to-£6,000 doesn't cover half my wages and 12.5% VAT of zero sales is still zero,\" said Mr Ooi. He said the government needed to convey \"a clear plan so we business owners are also able to plan\". The Treasury has been approached for a comment. ",

            "header": "UK economic growth slower than first thought before Omicron hit",
            "content": "The UK economy grew at a slower pace than first estimated between July and September, revised figures show. The Office for National Statistics (ONS) said during the quarter before Omicron took hold, the economy grew by 1.1%, rather than 1.3%, as Britain emerged from lockdown. It blamed weaker consumer spending, and the impact of energy companies going out of business. The economy is now 1.5% smaller than it was before the coronavirus pandemic. The data pre-dates the emergence of the Omicron variant of Covid, which is expected to be a further drag on growth. Darren Morgan, director of economic statistics at the ONS, said: \"Our revised figures show UK GDP (gross domestic product) recovered a little slower in the third quarter, with much weaker performances from health and hairdressers across the quarter, and the energy sector contracting more in September than we previously estimated. \"With the economy reopening in the third quarter, households saved less in the latest period. However, household saving was still up on pre-pandemic levels.\" What is GDP and how does it affect me? More than 20, mostly small energy suppliers have gone bust in recent months due to increased wholesale gas prices making price promises to customers undeliverable. Nearly four million other households have seen their supplier fail since the start of the pandemic, and a significant rise in bills is on the cards for about 15 million people in April. Weakness in the health sector, where test and trace work and vaccinations tailed off, and among hairdressers were also behind the revised growth estimate. However, Mr Morgan said stronger data for 2020 meant the economy was closer to pre-pandemic levels than first estimated. The slump in Britain's economy last year has now been estimated to be 9.4%, rather than 9.7%. Business investment also fell by 2.5% in the three months to September and was nearly 12% below its pre-pandemic level. But investors are braced for a further slowdown of GDP in the fourth quarter of 2021, and a weak start to 2022, due to the rise in Covid cases which has hurt Britain's hospitality sector and hit retailers. Bethany Beckett, economist at Capital Economics, said although the economy had got better at coping with coronavirus restrictions, the \"possibility of tighter restrictions in January is further darkening the outlook for GDP\". The ONS said Britain's recovery to its pre-pandemic economy remained behind most other big rich economies such as France, Germany and the US, in inflation-adjusted terms. ",

This issue has now been resolved and all payments that had been queued are now being processed,\" said a Nationwide spokesman. People expressed their concern on social media at the timing of the problems, just a few days before Christmas when finances are already stretched. One customer wrote on Twitter: \"What is going on? Not one person can give a straight answer! It's Christmas in three days and you can't tell people when they will have their money.

            "content": "Chancellor Rishi Sunak has set out a £1bn fund to help businesses hit by the rise in Covid cases, including the leisure and hospitality sector. Hospitality businesses like pubs and restaurants will be able to apply for cash grants of up to £6,000 per premises. The government would also help some firms with the cost of sick pay for Covid-related absences, Mr Sunak said. And he announced an extra £30m to help theatres and museums. Many hospitality and leisure firms have been hit by a collapse in bookings and reduced footfall due to people's fears over the spread of the Omicron variant. Mr Sunak said the new support was \"generous\" and recognised the situation facing businesses in the run-up to Christmas. Some industry figures have welcomed what they described as \"unprecedented\" support, but others said the measures do not go far enough. Businesses other than hospitality and leisure can apply for some of the funding. However, the chancellor would not be drawn on whether more help would come should further restrictions be announced, as ministers come under pressure to tackle the rapid rise of Omicron. No new Covid rules for England before Christmas\nScotland: Hogmanay events cancelled as Covid rules tightened\nMixed reaction to latest Covid package for firms Tough new rules have been brought in in Scotland, with a limit on the number of people allowed to attend large events and Edinburgh's Hogmanay street party being cancelled. Another 90,629 new Covid cases were reported across the UK on Tuesday - slightly down on the all-time highs announced last week. The announcement on Tuesday means: Restaurants, bars, cinemas and theatres can apply for a grant of up to £6,000 for each of their premises. The Treasury is setting aside £683m for these grants and it will be provided under existing council-run schemes\nOther struggling businesses outside leisure and hospitality can apply to local councils for a different grant under the Additional Restrictions Grant, which has been topped up with £102m\nThe Statutory Sick Pay Rebate Scheme is being reintroduced, meaning business with fewer than 250 employees can claim money to cover sick pay for employees who are affected by Covid\nAn extra £30m for arts organisations through the existing Culture Recovery Fund. Asked if more support would be offered, the chancellor said he would \"always respond proportionately and appropriately to the situation we face\". But he added that he thought the new measures announced were comparable to the grants that were on offer when businesses were fully closed earlier this year. The UK's devolved administrations are also receiving £154m of funding to cover all three schemes, with around £80m for Scotland, £50m for Wales and £25m for Northern Ireland. This money is part of a fund announced earlier this week. Challenged on whether he could rule out any more restrictions before the new year, Mr Sunak said he understood people's frustrations but the UK faced a very uncertain situation over Omicron. He echoed the prime minister's comments on Monday, saying ministers were keeping the situation under review and monitoring the data \"day-by-day, hour by hour\" but ruling nothing out. However, Labour's shadow Treasury minister Pat McFadden described Mr Sunak's announcement as \"a holding package from a government caught in a holding position\". Mr McFadden said the support was \"welcome\" but that it should have been announced last week when MPs voted to pass the government's Plan B measures. In the past, government support has been extended when government policy has restricted businesses ability to trade - so this is an important recognition that consumer caution can be almost as damaging as mandatory closure. The question then is - is this it? The chancellor said that the government has always responded when necessary but he was also at pains to point out that this level of grant funding was similar in generosity to those given during lockdown. A hint perhaps that this is as good as it gets - for grant funding at least. Business groups have welcomed today's move, but are clear that plenty of hardship lies ahead in the next year when business rates bills (albeit discounted) come due and the VAT discount wears off on 1 April. The British Chambers of Commerce and others would like to see a sector specific furlough scheme if firms are forced to close their doors. Perhaps most crushing of all for business confidence is the ongoing uncertainty, and with Covid-19 that is something over which the chancellor has little control. The reaction from businesses has been mixed. Shevaun Haviland, director general of the British Chambers of Commerce, said the new support would provide \"welcome respite\" to many firms affected by Covid measures, but warned that more could be needed if restrictions persist or are tightened. And Kate Nicholls, chief executive of UK Hospitality, welcomed the \"unprecedented support\" announced by Mr Sunak. But Michael Kill, chief executive of the Night Time Industries Association, said \"mixed\" government messaging and further restrictions had had a \"catastrophic impact\" on nightclubs and other late-night venues over the past two weeks. He described the chancellor's support package as \"far too little\" and said it bordered \"on the insulting\" in the face of failing businesses, lost livelihoods, and a \"crippled\" industry. A pub owner from Stoke-on-Trent has said he expects to receive just under £2,700 in support, rather than the headline £6,000 - as the system is based on business rates, so larger chains will be the ones to benefit from the top end of support. Rob Ledgar told BBC Radio 4's PM programme he was around 40 to 60% down on his normal festive turnover and the funding only represents \"about seven to 10 days worth of trade over Christmas\". Meanwhile, other business owners have urged the government to provide certainty about the Covid situation, rather than handouts. Nathan Godley, from restaurant supply firm Premier Seafoods in Grimsby, Lincolnshire, said that while he did not qualify for or want government support, he wanted certainty so he could plan orders in advance and avoid losing money or stock. He told BBC Radio 4's World at One there had been a drop in orders from restaurants in the last week as people cancelled bookings and that he would have to make \"contingency plans\" to preserve and freeze the fish until it could be sold in the new year. Meanwhile, the UK's devolved nations have already announced extra measures to combat the surge of the Omicron variant: In Scotland, from Boxing Day all outdoor events will be limited to just 500 people and the numbers at indoor events will also be cut to 200 if seated and 100 if standing. The rules will be in place for at least three weeks\nIn Wales, spectators will be banned from all sports events from 26 December, nightclubs will close from 27 December and social distancing will return in shops and workplaces after Christmas\nIn Northern Ireland, there is a limit of 30 on people mixing from different households in homes, face coverings are compulsory in shops and other venues and a Covid passport is needed to enter nightclubs, bars and cinemas Last week, Mr Johnson advised people to \"think carefully before you go\" out to socialise. England's chief medical officer Prof Chris Whitty also urged people not to \"mix with people you don't have to\". Do you run a hospitality business affected by the pandemic?

            "content": "Pubs, restaurants and theatres have cautiously welcomed new government grants to help them deal with a collapse in consumer confidence caused by Omicron. But others, including beauty salons and nightclubs, said the package was merely scratching the surface. Hospitality and leisure firms can apply for grants of up to £6,000 per premises as they face a sharp drop in bookings. There's also £30m more for the arts and £100m for councils to help small firms. But the Federation of Small Businesses warned that the success of the package would be \"measured by how quickly this new, urgently needed support reaches those in need\". Eating and drinking out are two activities that have been hit by the latest variant of Covid. Although pubs and restaurants remain open and have not been subject to new restrictions, many people have been reluctant to visit them for fear of catching the virus. The British Beer & Pub Association's chief executive, Emma McClarkin, said: \"This short-term package of support from the chancellor is welcome at this extremely challenging time for pubs and brewers. \"It will be a vital lifeline for many and will help compensate businesses for the dramatically reduced trade already being experienced in the run-up to Christmas.\" However, James Calder, chief executive of the Society of Independent Brewers, said the £6,000 announced for each pub \"isn't really going to touch the sides\". Pubs and restaurants warn time running out to help\nOmicron: Is it milder despite dodging immunity?\nNo new Covid curbs yet but we rule nothing out - PM The response was two cheers at best from independent Liverpool bar operator Ma Pub Group. \"Without furlough for now, the plan is to let us stay open, but the reality remains that trade has dropped hugely at the busiest time of the year,\" said boss Iain Hoskins. \"The point is that it costs me more to stay open than when we are closed and while I don't think anyone is expecting to have all lost Christmas sales reimbursed by the government, the £6,000 grant is a drop in the ocean at this time of year.\" Fulham Shore, the firm that runs the Franco Manca and Real Greek Restaurant chains, said £6,000 would cover just a week's worth of wages at one of its restaurants. While the support package is aimed at leisure businesses, gyms will not be eligible for the targetted grants, the Treasury confirmed. They can, however, apply for discretionary loans from local councils. The Chartered Institute for the Management of Sport and Physical Activity said it was \"dismayed\". \"Gyms, fitness and leisure centres have already felt the impact of reduced footfall in December and are now facing an extremely uncertain New Year,\" said boss Tara Dillon. \"In the middle of a national health crisis, and in the midst of winter, it is frankly staggering that the government does not recognise the value of a sector that helps to keep the nation physically and mentally fit, and employs hundreds of thousands of people.\" Best Western GB, which runs 300 UK hotels, said the chancellor's support was like a \"dud cracker on Christmas Day\". \"It's just so disappointing and underwhelming in every sense,\" said the chain's chief executive, Tim Rumney. He said the grants would not go far enough to cover the costs of three weeks of cancellations, with some hotels having seen 50% fewer bookings compared with pre-pandemic levels. \"It's too little, too late,\" he said. Mr Rumney said the VAT rate, which now stands at 12.5% for hospitality, should return to 5% and that the furlough scheme should be revived if Omicron worsens. Hair and beauty salons face particular problems, since it is not possible to observe social distancing when undergoing most of the treatments involved. However, the sector has received no targeted help as part of the latest measures, although businesses can still apply for an Additional Restrictions Grant, distributed by local councils to businesses outside leisure and hospitality at their own discretion. \"Our latest NHBF snap poll, from last week, demonstrates that over 70% of salons are experiencing unprecedented cancellations which will have a huge impact on their turnover,\" said Richard Lambert, chief executive of the National Hair & Beauty Federation. \"In the past, the government has called our industry 'essential' to UK GDP and well-being, so it's unfathomable that they are not giving any financial support to help save previously highly profitable salon businesses and those they employ.\" Lesley Blair, head of the British Association of Beauty Therapy & Cosmetology, was also disappointed. \"Our personal care sector has been one of the worst hit throughout this pandemic,\" she said. \"We urgently require government to provide our sector more support.\" High Street shops have also been hit as consumers go out less, but again, no targeted support was offered. Andrew Goodacre, head of the British Independent Retailers Association (Bira), said: \"Shops do not have cancelled bookings to shout about. However they do have lower footfall, cancelled trips to the shops and therefore cancelled purchases at a critical time of year - just as much damage but just not as 'visible.'\" The night-time economy is also badly served by the package, says nightclub operator Rekom, which has more than 40 venues across the UK. Peter Marks, chairman of its UK board, said the government had not done \"anywhere near\" enough. \"Given the fact that we would have made around £60,000 per premises per December, this covers just 10% per venue, so barely scratches the surface,\" he told the BBC. Mr Marks warned that the £6,000 would not take into account the size of the businesses, meaning larger operators would be disadvantaged. Michael Kill, the chief executive of the Night Time Industries Association, said the measures \"border on the insulting\". Theatres and museums saw themselves as more fortunate. Stephanie Sirr, chief executive of the Nottingham Playhouse and president of UK Theatre, told the BBC she felt the Treasury had \"clearly listened\" and was \"very grateful\". However, as this period is when theatres make most of their money, she explained that theatres were still set for an extremely tough Christmas. Travel industry trade body Abta said the chancellor's statement \"once again ignores the direct impact\" on businesses reliant on international travel. \"Travel agents, tour operators and travel management companies will rightly be asking why they haven't been given the same treatment as other businesses that are suffering at this time,\" Luke Petherbridge, Abta's director of public affairs, told the BBC. The head of trade body Airlines UK, Tim Alderslade, also said the travel industry would need similar support if the government's travel restrictions review on 5 January did not announce more help. \"We've done everything possible to preserve cash, as the chancellor asked us to. He now needs to either open up travel or provide the same support as offered to other sectors.\" ",

Amrapali Gan is currently marketing head at OnlyFans, which is known for hosting adult content, and has seen a spike in use during the pandemic. In a social media post Tim Stokely, who founded the company in 2016, said he was stepping down \"to pursue new endeavours\". Ms Gan had a \"deep passion\" for the firm, he said. \"I'm passing the baton on to a colleague and a friend, who has the vision and drive to help the organisation reach tremendous potential,\" Mr Stokely wrote on Instagram. Ms Gan said: \"I am proud to assume this role. I look forward to continuing to work closely with our creator community to help them maximize control over, and monetise, their content\". She said the firm offered \"a unique experience\" for its creators and fans and was committed to being \"the safest social media platform in the world\". Mr Stokely did not provide details about his future plans but said he would remain as an advisor during the transition phase at the controversial company.  OnlyFans reported a sharp rise in users during Covid lockdowns. It has 180 million registered users and over two million creators worldwide, the firm said. It has paid out over $5bn (£3.7bn) to its content creators since it first started trading five years ago, it said. But it has faced criticism for not doing enough to prevent under-age users selling explicit content. In August the site announced that all sexually explicit photos and videos would be blocked from October, following pressure from banking partners. But, following a backlash from its users, OnlyFans suspended the policy change a week later. The site offers a platform for musicians, fitness trainers and celebrities to charge their followers for tips and visual content. But it is best known for allowing content creators including porn stars and sex workers to charge for sexually explicit photographs and videos. OnlyFans takes a 20% commission on all payments made to its content creators. The firm said Ms Gan had been appointed \"to continue the company's growth and drive its vision and commitment to empowering creators\". Ms Gan told Bloomberg the company would increase its investment in its free streaming app, OFTV, and introduce new tools for creators. Ms Gan joined OnlyFans in 2020 after working for Red Bull, Quest Nutrition and a Los Angeles-based cannabis café. ",

            "content": "The chancellor has set out measures to help hospitality firms suffering cancellations and no-shows amid a rise in Covid-19 infections and a collapse in customer confidence. What do businesses who called for support think about Rishi Sunak's £1bn announcement? Eligible hospitality businesses will be able to get grants of up to £6,000, which Marcus Deaves, owner of Hidden Rooms in Cambridge, says is \"not bad news; it goes some way\". He emphasises he will have to look at the detail of the scheme and whether he will be available to claim. But he says there is still too much uncertainty over further Covid restrictions. \"We definitely need clarity. If we are not going to be open we need to plan for that, and if we are [open] we need to plan for that,\" he says. The owner of the 200-capacity table dining service says it \"costs £6,500 a month to stay closed, and that's without wages for the staff\". He says: \"All the utilities need to stay paid and we need to pay for cleaning - today we've had a deep clean. \"We haven't had a great 18 months and that's down to the lack of planning; it's that limbo we've been in. \"Business owners won't have a good Christmas and it will trickle down to staff as well.\" Publican Tom West, who runs three pubs in Manningtree and Dedham in Essex, and in Ipswich, says he was \"shocked\" by Mr Sunak's announcement. \"First, in the delivery and second in the amount. I'm in despair,\" he says. The £6,000 grant for businesses \"just is not enough\", he says. \"There is still no clarity if we still need to buy more beer or food. \"We don't know if we are going to be open on the 28th onwards, which is a date there have been rumours about, and what happens to our employees who've just lost 30% of their hours. \"That's the bit that really hurts; what do I do for my employees?\" He says £1bn \"sounds a lot but it is nowhere near enough\", and the grants will not cover the costs of business rates and rent. Mr West adds: \"What worries me is we get to Easter, we get back to normal trade, but who is going to work in the hospitality industry? \"We need the return of furlough.\" Philip Mills, of Thoroughbreads, a coffee shop and catering business in Cambridge, says of the chancellor's announcement: \"As grateful and relieved as I am, it's bit of sticking plaster scenario. \"It'll cover the overheads for a week or two.\" The worry for him, he says, is what will happen to business \"going forward in the medium-to-long term\". Mr Mills says the grant of up to £6,000 is \"great, but that doesn't really secure our future for the next month, it'll be mostly swallowed up by the weekly wage bill\". He says the his turnover is down 65-70% and \"January is historically quite a quiet month\". \"I'm pleased they announced something but we need a solution for businesses in the long term,\" he adds. The Chancellor Rishi Sunak unveiled a £1bn fund including cash grants of up to £6,000 per premises for each eligible firm. He said the government would also help certain firms with the cost of sick pay for Covid-related absences. He highlighted support already in place that will last through to next spring, citing a reduced rate of VAT for the tourism and hospitality sectors and a discount on business rates. The chancellor also announced an extra £30m to help theatres and museums. Find BBC News: East of England on Facebook, Instagram and Twitter.

            "content": "Small and medium-sized businesses will be able to claim money from the government to cover statutory sick pay that is paid to employees affected by Covid, the chancellor has said. Rishi Sunak said the Treasury was reintroducing the rebate scheme which ended on 30 September. It is part of a series of measures announced to support firms affected by the new wave of infections. Statutory sick pay (SSP) of £96.35 a week is paid by employers. The cost of sick pay is one of businesses' concerns as they face a wave of absences caused by the omicron variant of Covid. The Statutory Sick Pay Rebate Scheme means businesses with fewer than 250 employees will be reimbursed SSP for Covid-related absences, for up to two weeks per employee. They will be eligible to make a claim from now and can make claims retrospectively from mid-January. Sunak can fund new Covid support, says think tank\nWHO issues holiday warning over Omicron David Page, chairman of Fulham Shore, which runs pizza chain Franca Manca and the Real Greek restaurants, said the reintroduction of the rebate scheme was \"brilliant news\". Ten out of the firm's 80 outlets are now open for delivery only due to high levels of staff off with coronavirus. Some workers' contracts offer full pay to those off ill, albeit for a limited time. If that time runs out, or if workers do not receive sick leave in the first place, they should receive SSP. Employees should self-isolate for four days to be eligible for SSP, but are paid for every day they are self-isolating. The self-employed are not eligible, but casual or agency workers are entitled to it. Mr Sunak also announced other measures for firms, namely grants and support for businesses in the hospitality, leisure and cultural sectors. Mike Cherry, national chairman of the Federation of Small Businesses, said there was the prospect of one million people sick or self-isolating by January. \"This move will reduce stress for small employers up and down the country, helping those who are struggling most with depleted cashflow,\" he said. \"It is vital that small firms - once again up against a massively disrupted festive season - can reclaim the costs of supporting staff.\" Separately, workers affected by children or other dependants hit by Covid are generally entitled to time off in an emergency. However, they might not get paid, as it depends on the terms of their work contract. Many bosses are allowing parents to work flexibly, to try to manage both work and childcare. ",

            "content": "Chancellor Rishi Sunak can afford to step in and help struggling businesses hit by Omicron despite continued high public borrowing, says the Institute for Fiscal Studies. IFS director Paul Johnson told the BBC that although interest rates were going up, borrowing was still \"very cheap\". He spoke after figures showed the government borrowed less last month. The gap between its spending and tax income stood at £17.4bn in November, £4.9bn down on a year earlier. However, the figure was higher than analysts had forecast and it was also the second-highest total for November since monthly records began in 1993. Borrowing hit record levels because of Covid as the government spent billions of pounds on emergency measures. These included the furlough scheme, which wrapped up on 1 October. Mr Johnson said the chancellor would be able to afford to meet demands from pubs, restaurants and nightclubs for financial support. Although the Omicron variant of Covid has not led to lockdown measures as in previous waves of the pandemic, businesses are struggling because people are reluctant to go out. Among those seeking help is nightclub operator Rekom, which has more than 40 venues across the UK. Peter Marks, chairman of its UK board, told the BBC that attendances were 40% lower than usual \"at a time that's absolutely critical for us as a business\". He also feared the possibility of not being able to open on New Year's Eve, which is when the chain makes 8% to 10% of its annual profits. Where does the government borrow billions from?\nInterest rates rise for first time in three years\nEconomic growth stutters before impact of Omicron The IFS's Mr Johnson said, however, that it would be \"very hard indeed\" to provide targeted support to those who needed it most, given that city centres were harder hit than other areas. He added that fears of fuelling high inflation meant Mr Sunak would be worried about \"throwing more billions into the economy at this stage\". Government debt stood at more than £2.3 trillion at the end of November this year - about 96.1% of the UK's gross domestic product (GDP) and the highest level recorded since the early 1960s. The Office for National Statistics (ONS) estimates that the government has borrowed a total of £136bn so far in the current financial year (April to November), although this is £115.8bn less than in the same period last year. As a result of a lower income from taxes and higher spending, the ONS now estimates that in the 2020-21 financial year the government borrowed £321.9bn. That amounted to 15% of GDP, the highest rate seen since the end of World War Two. Rising inflation means that it is costing the government more to borrow money. Interest payments on central government debt were £4.5bn in November 2021, £0.4bn more than in November 2020. For this and other reasons, says Samuel Tombs of Pantheon Macroeconomics, \"the trend in public borrowing is about to deteriorate markedly\". He says that the pick-up in inflation means full-year debt interest payments look set to exceed the Office for Budget Responsibility (OBR) forecast by £5bn. \"All told, we now think that public borrowing will equal about £190bn this year, and would revise up this forecast to around £192bn, if the government reimposed for one month the rules seen during Step Two of the unlocking earlier this year and set up a furlough scheme for businesses that were forced to close,\" he added. \"Public borrowing was broadly on course to meet the OBR's forecast, based on data up to November, but high inflation and Omicron will push it off track.\" The figures for November seem \"like old news now\", according to Bethany Beckett of Capital Economics. \"These data predate the recent surge in coronavirus infections caused by the Omicron variant, with a near-term tightening of virus restrictions once again a possibility,\" she said. \"Although the economy has got better at coping with restrictions with each new wave, we still suspect it would prompt a deterioration in the public finances via lower tax revenues and the potential reintroduction of government support schemes.\" ",

            "header": "Brexit: The economic impact a year on",
            "content": "Twelve months since the trade deal with which Britain left the European Union, what impact has it had on the economy? Covid makes it impossible to be sure, but it's much harder to spot Brexit benefits than costs.\nSome of the effect will not be clearer until import customs are applied. Some larger companies have adapted. But haulage and hotels are short staffed. And for small food exporters, the paperwork and the costs have been mounting up.\nThe true economic impact could take many years to see. Meanwhile, many companies will wait for the UK to resolve its internal differences about the direction of Brexit. Christmas Eve 2020 was a busy one for those of us with the task of digesting the Brexit exit deal agreed that day by Boris Johnson and his chief Brexit negotiator, Lord Frost. A year on, we're still trying to find out what impact it will have. We may have a long wait. As Mao Zedong is often quoted as saying, when asked in the 1970s what he thought of the French Revolution: it's too early to judge. But it's been an interesting start. Think back to that time. Britain was already out of the European Union, but not of the single market and customs union. It was days away from \"crashing out\" with no agreement on trading arrangements, which seemed likely to lead to dire economic consequences. Kent was being prepared for a vast backlog of trucks, while exporters and importers were facing a meltdown in cross-Channel trade and supply chains. To square the circle on the Northern Irish peace process, the deal required the UK to accept what we were told no Prime Minister could ever accept - a trading boundary between the British mainland and Northern Ireland. It's unclear if Boris Johnson understood the deal he signed, or at least its consequences. Or perhaps he did, and reckoned he could later repudiate the bits he didn't like, and blame Brussels. Trying to make that boundary work between Cairnryan and Larne has eaten up a lot of 2021 and of goodwill between UK and EU, when the latter was already in short supply. It's still not resolved, and Lord Frost has just exited his Brexit role, citing disappointment at the way Brexit is going, as well as disapproval of Covid's constraints on individual liberties. His role has passed to Liz Truss, the Foreign Secretary, who didn't hold back in her critique of Brexit back in 2016. She has since embraced it. To reassure Tory hardliners on Brexit, one of their own is her number two. That means the politics and process of Brexit is a balancing act within Whitehall, while businesses, farmers, universities, travellers and numerous other groups have continued to adjust to life outside Europe's single market and customs union. I went back to some of those most affected, to find out how things look a year on. At the Crieff Hydro family-owned family of 11 hotels, proprietor Stephen Leckie says no-one in the industry realised it would be \"this bad\". He says the tone of Brexit has discouraged European visitors from visiting, but the direct impact is in staffing. Covid has taken away a large chunk of his custom; pre-Christmas group bookings were down by more than half on the normal level before Omicron hit, and now they're down to below a quarter. But even if he could attract the custom, he doesn't have the staff. Of 20 food outlets in his group, half are shut or operating well below capacity because of staff shortages. In recent months, one in six jobs has been vacant. There aren't enough housekeeping workers, so the hotel chain has had to constrain capacity to 70% of rooms during the week, and 85% at weekends. Those still on the payroll are complaining of having to work flat out with overtime and extra days. A Berlin-born food and beverage manager, Stefanie Phillips, explained that some EU nationals left Scotland for home, as they always have, though many departed earlier than planned because of Covid lockdowns. Others applied for settled status, expecting to return, but with Covid and job opportunities elsewhere, they've stayed away. Some applied to work in the UK, to find they have no work status. So how about recruiting elsewhere? A few Indians are joining, but work visas for Indians or Europeans cost £6,000, when Crieff is allowed one. They can only be for managerial posts. More junior posts are being filled by Strathearn teenagers, when they're not at school. A key part of the Brexit pitch was that British people would get the jobs instead of Europeans. So how's that going? Ms Phillips says the current tight labour market sees people leave quickly if they see something with higher pay or working hours that suit them better. Among small firms looking to source materials from the EU, getting hold of supplies has been disrupted by red tape. EU-based suppliers to the UK, with no previous exports outside Europe, now have to fill in consignment forms that they're unused to, and some choose not to bother. It seems that some have used Brexit as an excuse to crank up prices. But that also reflects supply chain disruption around the world, including sea-going freight and sky-high air cargo prices. It's rarely, if ever, easy to separate out these factors from Brexit. Economic modellers at the Centre for European Reform have given it a try, though. They compare the UK as it is with a doppelgänger UK, following the attributes of EU economies that were most similar before Brexit and before Covid. Isolating the Brexit effect suggests a drop of 11 to 16% in the amount of UK trade, which in October came to 15.7% on imports and exports, worth £12.6bn. Food faces the most new rules outside the EU. Importers of food into the UK have not yet been hit by delays and red tape at UK customs, because implementation of the rules has been delayed, and then delayed again. Whitehall is wary: there could be a blame game if imported fresh fruit and veg prices soar, along with French cheese, Italian olive oil and pasta, and Irish dairy and beef. Scottish exporters of food have been among the firms most affected so far. They have found Brexit has been good for generating paperwork where none previously existed. The larger firms, which export by the truckload, are getting used to the form-filling. Inconsistent application of the rules by inexperienced EU customs officers are less of a problem than earlier this year. So farmed salmon, for instance, has recovered from a very rocky few weeks last winter, when seafood was the first to encounter disruption at Channel ports. Others had stockpiled and were waiting to see what happened. Fresh seafood cannot wait, so that put Scottish exporters into the Brexit frontline. Salmon is getting through, but it often takes longer, and if it misses market deadlines and has shorter shelf-life, it is worth less. Scottish salmon prices have lost some of their premium. As much of Scottish aquaculture is owned in Norway and the Faroes, these companies are happy to supply from elsewhere. It is the smaller companies that have found it toughest. MacDuff Beef, a family firm with its butcher business in Lanarkshire, used to export prize cuts to the most discerning of continental butchers and restaurants. It was as easy to sell into Europe as to any customer in the UK. But it only ever sent small consignments. MacDuff is not on a scale to fill a truck. The company's boss, Andrew Duff, says hauliers are not willing to risk multiple pallets of meat from different exporters, when each one has to have separate paperwork, and they move at the pace of the least well-prepared. So MacDuff has simply given up exporting to the European Union, and sees no prospect of returning. Instead, Andrew Duff has turned his attention to retail, opening a counter in Edinburgh's new St James Quarter. That's created three jobs. And you can find jobs being created elsewhere, some of them as European firms feel the need to have a UK presence. At Angelbond shellfish wholesaler in Glasgow, manager Ronald Scordia has taken on another worker to handle the paperwork involved in sending langoustine and lobster to the market in Boulogne-sur-Mer. He has cut down the number of consignments from daily to three or four per week. He needs to be licensed for export, and each consignment needs a permit to be allowed to travel the short distance from Calais to the Boulogne market. Total cost of Brexit this year for Angelbond: £100,000 plus another salary, on turnover of around £5.5m. For the bigger picture, I turned to Sir Anton Muscatelli, principal of Glasgow University, who chaired the Brexit advisory panel for the Scottish government. What marks does this economics professor give Brexit after a year outside the European Union's single market? A low one, he says. Trade is down. It has inevitably been hit, when such a complex and large trading partnership has costs and friction added. The labour market has been hit by the shortage of haulage drivers and hospitality workers, but he says that is impossible to disentangle from the effects of Covid. Is he seeing benefits from Brexit? None are conspicuous, in economic terms. Some EU companies have put subsidiaries into the UK, or listed on London Stock Exchange. Some will thrive better in trading beyond Europe, as they might have done anyway. Answers sought on Australia trade deal\nBrexit and fishing rights\nNew UK laws to sweep away EU state aid rules But these are relatively small effects. Sir Anton says most economists were expecting Brexit to have a reduction in the UK's economic output, after ten years, between 3.5% and 8% lower than it would have been otherwise. What about \"global Britain\" - the Brexiteer term for the prospect of trade deals with countries beyond Europe which have faster-growing economies? Almost all the trade deals so far are copied and pasted from the UK's time within the EU. Australia is the first to get to a deal, but Professor Muscatelli sees it offering relatively small prospects. Finalised this month, tariff-free trade on beef and lamb, after 15 years of transition, is still seen by British livestock farmers as a relatively large threat. Making the UK part of the trans-Pacific partnership is too distant to gauge, says Muscatelli. A US trade deal was the big prize, but ex-President Trump was never likely to deliver a serious one, and President Biden is not prioritising trade deals or the UK. So low marks so far, but also the observation from Sir Anton that these are early days. We were never likely to see a transformation within a year. We have barely begun to see the start of one, he says: \"One year is too soon. In any case, most of us thought if there was to be an exit from the single market and the customs union, there would be a barren period, and then possibly in a few years time, both sides would begin to look at whether the Trade and Co-operation Agreement needs some deepening in areas where it is hampering trade.\" That is one area where Brexit is far from settling into new relationships, either with the EU or with other economies around the world. And it will be hard to resolve those external relationships until the UK resolves its own internal tensions. Being outside the UK is now firmly entrenched in English politics, but not in Scotland or Northern Ireland. On the contrary, it's become a significant lever for those wishing to leave the UK. Even within the ranks of the Brexiteers, there are big differences about the kind of Britain they want it to create. Ex-minister Lord David Frost was clear that he wanted a de-regulated UK, better able to compete beyond Europe. In his resignation letter, he wrote to the Prime Minister: \"You know my concerns about the current direction of travel. I hope we will move as fast as possible to where we need to get to: a lightly regulated, low-tax, entrepreneurial economy.\" When Boris Johnson thinks as a journalist, tearing down regulatory intrusion into day-to-day life is his instinct also. But that's not where the public is, and when Boris Johnson thinks as prime minister, he seems wary of deregulation. That is not only because it would increase friction in trade with Europe, but because many of the rules he used to criticise as a journalist have significant support within Britain - from food safety to job protection. Says Sir Anton Muscatelli: \"The big economic gains would have been if the UK had decided, say, to heavily de-regulate in agriculture, in terms of being able to import really cheap food. But that's not what our population wants. They want to maintain high environmental standards. \"I suspect that will be part of a post-post-Brexit debate. In five years time, once the political heat is taken out of discussion of Brexit, the political debate will settle down around the question of what kind of country we want to be, in terms of economic arrangements and trade. \"At the end of the day, The EU and UK are close geographically. They have to trade. The question is: is this where we should settle, or might we get closer without necessarily re-joining the EU?\" ",

            "content": "The UK Supreme Court has prevented Venezuelan President Nicolás Maduro from accessing $1.95bn (£1.4bn) of gold stored in the Bank of England (BoE). Mr Maduro says the cash will be used to fight Covid-19 in the country. The Supreme Court overturned a prior Court of Appeal ruling, meaning that the UK recognises opposition leader Juan Guaidó as the country's legitimate leader. Despite this, in practice the UK deals with the Maduro administration. Mr Guaidó and Mr Maduro have separately appointed two different sets of governors to Venezuela's central bank. Mr Guaidó, who is recognised by more than 50 countries as the legitimate president, wants the gold to stay in the BoE's vaults. But Mr Maduro, who remains in the presidential palace and in control of the government, military and police, has sued BoE to have the funds released. Mr Maduro was re-elected to a second six-year term in May 2018 in highly controversial polls, which most opposition parties boycotted. He claims the money will be transferred to the United Nations Development Programme (UNDP) to buy medical supplies to fight the pandemic. His critics have blamed him for mismanaging Venezuela's economy, causing a severe crisis where millions of people need aid due to collapsing public services, soaring unemployment and a devalued local currency. They claim Mr Maduro will use the funds to pay off foreign allies that support his regime. Venezuela has been sanctioned by a group of nations including the US, UK, European Union, Canada, Switzerland, Panama and Mexico since 2014 over corruption, human rights violations and the suppression of democracy. The Court of Appeal ruling had overturned an earlier UK High Court judgement in July 2020, which ruled that the UK government's recognition of Mr Guaidó as Venezuela's acting president was \"clear and unequivocal\". On Monday, the Supreme Court said that the Court of Appeal ruling was \"misplaced\", because all British courts needed to accept that Mr Maduro was not recognised as president \"for any purpose\". However, it has now asked the Commercial Court to consider whether rulings by Venezuela's Supreme Tribunal of Justice, which has declared Mr Guaidó's efforts unlawful, should be recognised. Citing the Transition Statute - articles in the constitution which in such cases call for the leader of the National Assembly to step in - Juan Guaidó declared himself interim president in January 2019. He has since used these laws to appoint central bank officials, which Mr Maduro continues to contend is not permitted under Venezuelan law. EXPLAINER: What's behind Venezuela's political crisis?\nCONTEXT: Three in four Venezuelans in extreme poverty: study Mr Guaidó welcomed the ruling on Monday, saying he and his appointees would \"continue to be dedicated to the constitutional duty to protect the assets of the Republic for future generations\". Sarosh Zaiwalla, a London-based lawyer representing Venezuela's central bank, said: \"Our client looks forward to continuing this case, with a view to showing that the Board of the El Banco Central de Venezuela (BCV) in Caracas is the only validly appointed authority to deal with Venezuela's foreign assets in the interests of the Venezuelan population.\" ",

            "content": "China Mobile, the world's largest mobile network operator, aims to raise as much as $8.8bn (£6.7bn) when it lists its shares in Shanghai. The company was kicked off the New York Stock Exchange due to rules imposed during Donald Trump's presidency. It joins a growing number of US-listed Chinese firms that are exiting Wall Street. China Mobile's smaller rivals, China Telecom and China Unicom, have already made the move to their home country. The three firms were delisted from the New York Stock Exchange after a Trump-era decision to restrict investment in Chinese technology companies. The policy remained in place under the administration of President Joe Biden as tensions continue between Washington and Beijing. On Monday, Chinese artificial intelligence start-up SenseTime Group relaunched its $767m Hong Kong share sale. The announcement came a week after the listing was pulled after Americans were banned from investing in the firm. Washington had accused SenseTime of developing facial recognition software to determine people's ethnicity, with a focus on identifying ethnic Uyghurs. The company has repeatedly denied the US government's allegations: \"Our group's products and services are intended for civilian and commercial uses and not for any military application,\" it said in a statement on Monday. SenseTime's shares are due to start trading on the Hong Kong Stock Exchange on 30 December. Also this month, Chinese ride-hailing giant Didi Global said it planned to take its shares off the New York Stock Exchange and move its listing to Hong Kong. The announcement came after the US market watchdog unveiled tough new rules for Chinese firms that list in America. \"Following careful research, the company will immediately start delisting on the New York stock exchange and start preparations for listing in Hong Kong,\" the company said on its account on Weibo, China's Twitter-like microblogging network.

            "content": "Fraudsters are directing people on Facebook to sites claiming to sell fake Covid vaccine passes for those who have not been jabbed, the BBC has found. People in the UK are required to prove their vaccination status in order to access some places and to avoid self-isolation after travelling abroad. But posts on the social media site are offering unvaccinated people false certification to get around the rules. Facebook said it would remove the content \"whenever we find it\". NHS Covid passes were introduced in England in some settings, as part of the UK government's Plan B measures in the wake of the Omicron coronavirus variant spreading rapidly. To receive a pass the recipient must prove that they have been vaccinated with two doses of an approved vaccine, have completed a negative PCR test or negative rapid lateral flow test within the past 48 hours or are exempt from vaccination or vaccination and testing on the basis of a medical exemption or clinical trial participation. \"We were finding passes, certificates, cards, vaccine cards, even down to choice of what vaccine you wanted recording on the card,\" said Jonathan Benton, who runs cyber investigation firm Intelligent Sanctuary. Where will I need to use a Covid passport?\nCan the US crack down on fake vaccination cards? Mr Benton, a former senior detective, said a range of passes were available for sale, ranging from some which are legitimate cards but fraudulently filled in, to complete forgeries. Covid certificates have been found for sale alongside drugs, weapons and stolen goods on the dark web, with sellers claiming to provide documentation from many countries, including the US and the EU. A government spokesperson said: \"Fraud is a crime and falsifying evidence of Covid-19 status could not only put lives at risk but lead to a £10,000 fine. \"The NHS Covid Pass is a safe, secure and free way for individuals to share their Covid-19 vaccination record - it includes rigorous security features to minimise the risk of fraud and help organisations authenticate the Covid Pass presented to them. \"We continue to work closely with law enforcement and partners to tackle online scams, including Covid-19 related fraud.\" In one post, one seller claimed to be able to provide certificates from 22 countries including Portugal, France, Greece, Spain, Australia, Latvia, Morocco and the UK. They were not only offering paper certificates, but purported to be able to provide national health authority Covid apps with QR codes, because they said they worked with people inside health authorities, who would able to add information to the database. \"Sadly, I would say [that claim] is probably highly credible,\" said Mr Benton, who also previously worked for the National Crime Agency (NCA). Mr Benton said it was difficult to know who is behind such sales, but he and his team believed organised crime groups were involved, with more criminals moving to online spaces. \"If I'm committing organised, violent crime out there on the street, and there's a risk of me getting caught and then going to prison for 10 years, versus being behind the screen of a laptop having a number of people committing fraud, I'm going to naturally migrate to that place,\" he said. Meanwhile, on Facebook, the BBC found several examples of posts or comments claiming to be selling Covid vaccination certificates for people who had not been jabbed. The posts advertised that passes would help people keep their jobs, attend events or travel more easily. And while some posts were taken down within a few days by Facebook, the BBC reported 10 posts and comments. The majority were taken down within 24 hours, but more posts and comments have appeared again on the same pages since then. The BBC also found several Facebook posts linked to channels on encrypted messaging app Telegram which offered to sell Covid certificates to unvaccinated people. Analysis by the BBC and cyber-security firm Checkpoint found that over a seven-month period between December 2020 and July 2021, Telegram channels offering Covid passes for unvaccinated people in multiple languages grew from below 10 to more than 1,000. One Telegram channel claiming to offer NHS and EU digital Covid passports has amassed more than 180,000 subscribers since 14 December. The BBC has contacted Telegram for comment. For Mr Benton, the task of catching fraudsters is a difficult one, and counterfeiting is \"impossible\" to stop. \"If you look at the sites that we are looking at, where you've got passes or QR passes for sale. On those same websites they are selling illegal drugs, firearms, a number of illicit materials,\" he said. \"Frankly law enforcement are struggling to keep on top of it and understand who is behind selling these goods. I can't see how they can possibly police it.\" The problem of forged Covid passes is not new or unique to the UK, with fraudsters also advertising fake Covid certificates in the US. For $100 (£70), one vendor said they could deliver a \"registered\" card, with either the logo of the US Centers for Diseases Control and Prevention (CDC) or the NHS. It is difficult to know how many fake passes are in circulation, but according to one Border Force union, some have been used to try to get into the UK. Lucy Moreton of the Immigration Services Union said fake passes had been available ever since official vaccination documentation was introduced. \"When border force were checking, we were seeing a significant minority. We would get a number of them every single day and we've no reason to believe that's changed,\" she added. Earlier this year, Border Force was directed to stop checking people's Covid documentation and airlines have been doing so instead. \"Because Border Force no longer check routinely, we don't know how prevalent these are and how much this is actually being used and being missed by the airlines who are understandably not forgery experts,\" said Ms Moreton. She said spotting fakes was \"no different from spotting an email scam\", but added there was \"no model\" for extensive checks and that border queues would \"become really unmanageable\". But, she says, returning to paperwork checks would cause other problems. \"There's no model for running the UK border extends to controlling British citizen in a process that takes 10-12 minutes If we were to check from every individual, rapidly the queues would become really unmanageable.\" The Labour Party said the UK needed \"much stronger action\" against this type of online crime and called on the Home Office to \"urgently make sure the border Covid system isn't full of gaps because of fake documents\". A statement from Meta, which owns Facebook, said it prohibited anyone from buying, selling, or trading fake, or even genuine, medical documents on its platforms. \"We'll continue to identify and remove this content whenever we find it, and will disable accounts, pages or groups that repeatedly break our rules,\" the company added.

            "content": "Elon Musk, the world's richest person, has tweeted he will pay $11bn (£8.3bn) in tax for this year. Mr Musk has been embroiled in a public debate on social media over how much tax he pays. Earlier this week, Democratic Senator Elizabeth Warren tweeted that Mr Musk should stop \"freeloading off everyone else\". \"For those wondering, I will pay over $11bn in taxes this year,\" the billionaire responded. The BBC is not responsible for the content of external sites.\nView original tweet on Twitter Mr Musk, co-founder of electric car maker Tesla and aerospace manufacturer SpaceX, became the world's richest person earlier this year. Bloomberg Billionaires Index puts his wealth at $243bn, while Tesla is worth around $1tn and SpaceX is worth $100bn. Last week, Mr Musk was named Time Magazine's Person of the Year. That prompted Senator Warren to tweet: \"Let's change the rigged tax code so 'The Person of the Year' will actually pay taxes and stop freeloading off everyone else.\" The BBC is not responsible for the content of external sites.\nView original tweet on Twitter US President Joe Biden is keen to increase taxes on the ultra-rich, although legislative plans have so far stalled in Congress. Some senators, including Ms Warren, have backed the idea of taxing not only the income of America's richest citizens, but also the rising value of the assets they hold, like shares. Many of America's wealthiest citizens don't take a directly taxable salary. Instead, they hold their wealth in shares and other investments, then take out loans using those assets as collateral. Mr Musk responded to Senator Warren's tweet, saying he would be paying \"more taxes than any American in history this year\". Columbia University professor and tax expert, Robert Willens, said that was likely to be a fair comment from Mr Musk, who had made himself liable for \"mind-boggling amounts of taxable income\" in 2020, through exercising stock options that would otherwise have expired and been worthless. Stock options are agreements that the holder can purchase a stock at a set price in the future. The current value of Tesla shares is significantly higher than when Mr Musk was granted the original stock options, so the value he gains by exercising those options would be considerable and would count as taxable income, added Mr Willens. \"[Mr Musk] probably felt it would be prudent to generate as much taxable income in 2021 as possible, on the theory that income in 2022 might be taxed at higher rates,\" he explained. Musk makes whistleblower joke with new Tesla item\nWatch: Who is Elon Musk?k\nSenator vows to sink key Biden spending plan If some of Congress' more radical measures were enacted, that would have had a big impact on Mr Musk's tax liabilities, Mr Willens added. The bulk of Mr Musk's tax payment, to be made next year, will go to federal tax authorities, but the state of California, where Tesla and Mr Musk have been based until recently, will also claim a portion. Earlier this month, Tesla announced in a US Securities Exchange Corporation (SEC) filing that it was moving its corporate headquarters to Texas - a plan Mr Musk had hinted at in media interviews for several months, citing unhappiness with the Californian state government laws and criticising the high cost of living in Silicon Valley. Texas has more lenient tax rules - it does not collect income tax, in contrast to California, which has the highest income tax rates among US states, according to thinktank the Tax Foundation. Over the last few weeks, Mr Musk has sold around $14bn of Tesla shares, which Mr Willens said was likely to be in part in order to generate cash to satisfy his tax liabilities. While the numbers involved in the case of Mr Musk were exceptional, this was a standard approach for a corporate executive to take to expiring stock options, he added. ",

            "content": "Pret A Manger has received thousands of complaints over its drinks subscription service following frustration that not all promised beverages are available. The £20 a month deal offers unlimited hot and cold drinks. But the BBC understands the High Street chain has received 5,000 complaints about the offer, such as smoothies often being unavailable. Ex-Pret staff have also told the BBC its introduction has meant workers feel overwhelmed by the increased workload. Pret a Manger launched the subscription in September 2020 after sales plunged during Covid lockdowns. The company said it was \"really pleased\" with the response to the subscription offer where it pledges: \"If our Baristas brew it, blend it or steam it, you can have it!\" \"While it's been incredibly popular, we're constantly working with our teams and customers to make it better, so that we're able to continue to deliver the outstanding service our people are known for,\" the company said. But some customers said that this is not always the case. Rachel, from Watford, who had been on furlough for months, recently started commuting again. \"As I was now travelling into London again I thought I'd treat myself to drinks I wouldn't usually try,\" she told the BBC. \"But most of the time I'm told that I can't have a cold drink because they're unavailable.\" Another customer, Brendan, also subscribed, limiting himself to two drinks a day \"to stay healthy\". But he told the BBC that by mid-afternoon mango and pineapple preference is often not available. \"It's become a long standing joke with the staff now,\" he said. \"I laughed it off for a while, but now I'm getting angry and I'm starting to feel I've been ripped off`.\" Pret to hire 3,000 staff as city workers return\nPret a Manger makes staff pay cuts permanent Meanwhile another customer, Isabelle, tweeted: \"Have been to four Prets this morning that have 'stopped doing smoothies'. Is this because of the subscription? The smoothies were a key part of me wanting to sign up.\" Other customers have taken their complaints to the UK's Advertising Standards Authority (ASA). The regulator has contacted Pret a Manger to say that they should \"consider reviewing the ads for their subscription service\". The ASA said it informed Pret \"that their ads should not state or imply that the service was available in all store locations, or that it covers their entire range of products if that wasn't the case\". Pret said: \"We have spoken with the ASA to ensure all Pret marketing for the coffee subscription is in accordance with their latest guidance.\" Meanwhile, some former Pret employees said working conditions became \"unbearable\" after the subscription was launched. One claimed that staff deliberately turned blending machines off as it takes one-and-a-half minutes to prepare a smoothie. If a \"mystery shopper\" is in store they'll be marked down - with the team missing out on financial bonuses - if they don't deliver drinks within a strict time frame. He also alleges that other colleagues pretend the machines are broken, are being washed or there's a supply issue and they've run out of the small blue bags which contain a carefully portioned amount of fruit. \"Staff are just frustrated and tired with the endless smoothie and frappes giveaway, and they just boycott it, \" he said. \"It is just easy to say that ice or smoothies or frappe are gone for today. \"They are really time consuming. Try to make 50 smoothies daily one by one and you will feel it.\" A Pret barista who recently quit revealed that he had worked for his store in the Thames Valley since it opened three years ago: \"But the whole demeanour changed when they brought in the subscription. The blending machines can't take it. \"I can understand why Pret think it makes commercial sense but the staff can't take much more.\" Another Pret worker was so disgruntled with the conditions that she set up a website to gather complaints. The site, expret.org, is kept up to date with the latest frustrations, as she felt no one was listening to her or her colleagues. Pret claims that less than 1% of the complaints about their subscription are about the lack of smoothies or frappes. A spokesman added that when Pret suggested frappes and smoothies would be removed from the subscription earlier in 2021: \"There was a public outcry so Pret listened and kept them as part of the subscription.\" In the same month Pret launched the deal, rival Leon offered a similar promotion for £15 a month - but it was limited to 75 coffees a month and excluded other drinks such as teas and hot chocolate. Leon has since suspended it, stating: \"To help our teams during these difficult times, we have stopped taking on new subscribers.\" ",

            "content": "Hospitality businesses are suffering from a rash of pre-Christmas cancellations and no-shows amid a rise in Covid-19 infections and fears over the Omicron variant. How are business owners feeling - and what do they want to happen next? Business owners are on tenterhooks as they wait to see what action the government will take after Deputy Prime Minister Dominic Raab said he could not guarantee there would not be a Christmas lockdown. For many, such as Marcus Deaves, owner of Hidden Rooms in Cambridge, the hope of a busy December to help mitigate the losses of the past 20 months and tide them over into spring, have all but vanished. The owner of the 200-capacity table dining service has seen a slew of corporate cancellations for Christmas parties since 30 November. He hopes the venue can still go ahead with its \"legendary\" New Year's Eve party, but says requests for refunds have already started coming in. \"We don't bear any grudges over these cancellations,\" he says. \"I understand that businesses have a duty to protect their staff, but this mixed messaging from government is nothing short of a catastrophe for the hospitality industry. \"I'd like the government to consider the damage already done through its 'limiting interactions' messaging and respond accordingly.\" Mr Deaves is calling for a government compensation package. Publican Tom West, who runs three pubs in Manningtree and Dedham in Essex, and in Ipswich, would also like to see compensation from the government. On the situation facing hospitality businesses, he says: \"It's petrifying, especially at Christmas.\" In a post on Facebook, Mr West criticised the government's handling of the situation, adding that business rate and VAT reductions were not effective if they had no sales. \"I fear we are back to the start of previous lockdowns,\" he wrote. \"I'm ok with being closed, I'm not ok with taking unnecessary financial gambles and risk in business whilst waiting for our leaders to decide their next steps.\" Mr West, who employs 60 staff, says his pubs had experienced 580 cancellations, totalling over £20,000, for December, \"a month that traditionally provided solid profits for the year could now be [a] loss making festive period.\" He wrote: \"But what concerns me most isn't the losses, it's the morale of our staff who've stuck with us, now worried they might not have money for Christmas and January. \"Hospitality staff are the best and we are at risk of a second mass exodus.\" Mr West's social media post was in the form of a letter to Santa Claus and included a number of Christmas \"wishes\". These included the government telling business of its plans for lockdown and any furlough, communicating with one voice, and to \"stop leaking stories\". Philip Mills, of Thoroughbreads, Cambridge, says despite a very challenging two years, he took over the building next door to his cafe in July, after becoming \"so busy\", and also increased the number of staff. The cafe is located in \"Silicon Fen\", between the city's business and science parks, so in normal times would have a stream of customers working nearby. But he says the recent announcement telling people to work from home if possible had a \"huge impact\" on the business. He says the firm's busiest period was two weeks ago, but since then trade has dropped by some 45%. \"Our fixed overheads haven't changed; we've now got the new unit and we're just hoping and praying we'll get some government support,\" he says. Mr Mills says outside catering to businesses is \"a huge part\" of the firm's trade and this has also been \"dramatically\" hit. \"A fourth lockdown would be a challenge; it would be devastating,\" he says. He is appealing to the prime minister and the chancellor to offer \"at least some sort of targeted furlough\" to the hospitality sector. The hospitality industry has estimated takings in December will be down by 40% - with the damage up to twice that in London. A Treasury spokesperson said: \"The chancellor has spoken to a range of business and industry leaders in recent days. \"We recognise how important the festive period is for so many businesses and the government will continue to engage constructively on how it can best provide ongoing support to the businesses and sectors affected.\" Find BBC News: East of England on Facebook, Instagram and Twitter.

David Page, chairman of the firm which runs the Real Greek and Franco Manca, said Rishi Sunak needed to provide financial help \"in the next 24 hours\". It comes as 100,000 retail, hospitality and leisure businesses called on government for more support. The government is yet to offer further measures for struggling businesses. Mr Page said the country was in \"lockdown by stealth\" due to government advice to limit social contacts. \"The chancellor better get his act together otherwise it's going to be a really horrible Christmas for our sector,\" said Mr Page, chairman of Fulham Shore. \"If you want a choice of restaurants the chancellor, needs to do something very, very quickly. \"I'm not sure any of the cabinet understand cash flow and cash flow is the problem at the moment, over the last week or two and over the next 10 days.\" UK shoppers avoid High Streets amid Omicron fears\nBusiness alarm at prospect of more Covid measures Restaurants and pubs have been dealing with large numbers of cancellations in the run-up to Christmas as fears have risen over the spread of Omicron. The hospitality industry has estimated takings in December will be down by 40% - with the damage up to twice that in London. A letter to the chancellor, penned by 100,000 businesses, argued existing support from the government was \"insufficient\". Matthew Sims, head of Croydon Business Improvement District, said it was \"alarming\" that Mr Sunak was \"doggedly sticking to measures which are out of date and out of touch with the stark and desperate reality retail, hospitality and leisure businesses are facing\". Mr Page said that while city centre branches of Franco Manca and Real Greek restaurants were experiencing a dip in sales, trade in commuter areas across England was up. \"We have got a geographical spread, that helps us. If you're exposed to central London and you've only got one or two sites, you're in trouble at the moment,\" he said. Nick Mackenzie, boss of pub chain Greene King, said bookings had been \"decimated\" across the business amid the rapid spread of the Omicron coronavirus variant. He agreed with Mr Page that the country was in lockdown \"in all but name\", due to government messaging. He called on the government for \"urgent\" help, with others saying firms needed support \"in the next 24 hours\". Greene King, which manages 1,700 pubs and rents out 1,000, faced an \"incredibly difficult\" situation during what would usually be its busiest trading period of the year, Mr Mackenzie said. \"Demand has dropped, bookings have been decimated, in some parts of the country we are 70-80% down on 2019,\" he said. Mr Mackenzie said the government \"should be commended\" for the measures it brought in to help hospitality businesses earlier in the pandemic, but added that the situation was \"urgent again now\". \"We need them to move towards things like furlough support for [pubs] that we are having to close or those severely impacted, business rates relief, and removal of the cap on business rates.\" The government has not ruled out bringing in further Covid restrictions before Christmas, with Health Secretary Sajid Javid telling the BBC's Andrew Marr Show there were \"no guarantees\" in a pandemic. Greene King said if it had to close sites due to government restrictions, the shut down and then reopening costs to the business would be about £5,000 per pub. The UK's food and drink wholesalers, which supply schools, care homes and hospitals as well as pubs and restaurants, have warned they face losing millions of pounds if a new lockdown is announced, with millions of tonnes of food currently in warehouses going to waste. The Federation of Wholesale Distributors (FWD) said businesses could \"no longer absorb the losses caused by last-minute closure of their customers\". Chancellor Mr Sunak met with representatives from the hospitality sector last Thursday to discuss their concerns, after Prime Minister Boris Johnson advised people to \"think carefully before you go\" out to socialise. The UK's chief medical officer Prof Chris Whitty also urged people not to \"mix with people you don't have to\". A Treasury spokesperson said: \"The chancellor has spoken to a range of business and industry leaders in recent days. \"We recognise how important the festive period is for so many businesses and the government will continue to engage constructively on how it can best provide ongoing support to the businesses and sectors affected.\" ",

The meeting was due to take place in Switzerland from 17-21 January, but is now planned for \"early summer\". WEF said the current pandemic conditions \"make it extremely difficult to deliver a global in-person meeting\". Instead, it said participants would take part in a series of \"state of the world\" sessions online. \"The deferral of the annual meeting will not prevent progress through continued digital convening of leaders from business, government and civil society,\" said Prof Klaus Schwab, founder and executive chairman of the World Economic Forum. \"Public-private cooperation has moved forward throughout the pandemic and that will continue apace.\" Last year, the annual WEF meeting was shifted from Davos because of Covid and had been due to be held in Singapore during August before the event was cancelled. Switzerland has become the latest country to introduce new Covid restrictions, including a mandatory order to work from home, as the Omicron variant of Covid spreads through Europe. \"Despite the meeting's stringent health protocols, the transmissibility of Omicron and its impact on travel and mobility have made deferral necessary,\" the WEF said. Launched in 1971, WEF aims to \"improve the state of the world\" by bringing leaders from business, politics, charity and academia together. The conference - which is criticised by some as being elitist - had until last year been held annually in the Alpine ski resort of Davos. ",

            "content": "UK shoppers chose to avoid High Streets and city centres on the crucial weekend just before Christmas, amid fears over the Omicron Covid-19 variant. The number of people on High Streets fell by 5.9% on Sunday but rose 4.8% at retail parks week-on-week, retail analysis firm Springboard said. Springboard's Diane Wehrle, said consumers were \"clearly cautious\" about venturing out to the shops. Shoppers were also making quick \"in and out\" visits, another expert added. Business alarm at prospect of more Covid measures\nFirms plead for help as customers cancel bookings\nCan businesses survive another lost Christmas? Ms Wehrle said, in part, this was due to shoppers trying to get a head start in buying groceries, while also preferring the \"Covid friendly\" nature of retail parks, as they are in the open air, have large stores and can be easily reached by car. The Springboard figures also showed that 25.2% fewer people visited UK retail destinations on Sunday, compared to 22 December 2019, the Sunday just before Christmas that year. However, visitor numbers across all UK destinations on Sunday were 33.2% higher than on Sunday 20 December 2020, when the UK entered its third coronavirus lockdown. On Sunday, Health Secretary Sajid Javid told the BBC's Andrew Marr that further Covid restrictions for England over Christmas could not be ruled out, due to the rise in new cases. Consumer expert Kate Hardcastle said that retailers were experiencing another \"crushing blow\" this Christmas because consumers were not really \"buying emotionally\", in the way they usually did for loved ones in years prior to the pandemic. \"Shoppers are staying warm and dry, already isolating ready for the holiday at home and grabbing any extras online,\" she told the BBC. \"Whilst shoppers had the intent to buy themselves a better Christmas than last year, the idea of not being able to spend it with loved ones again is just too much of a gamble.\" A key change, Ms Hardcastle said retailers had told her, was that consumers were \"shopping differently\" this year. \"A big national retailer explained it was getting as many staff on the tills as possible as people wanted to be in and out,\" she said. \"That's an important point - if we don't dwell in stores our spending will not be the same and we will not see consumers pick up extras.\" ",

            "content": "Plans to raise the state pension age from 66 should be shelved because we are not living as long as previously expected, a new report has suggested. Current plans would see the age at which people are eligible for the state pension go up to 67 by 2028, and then eventually to 68. Consultant LCP says life expectancy has stalled and no changes should be made for 30 years. The government has just launched its latest review of the state pension age. At present: The full, new flat-rate state pension (for those who reached state pension age after April 2016) is £179.60 a week\nThe full, old basic state pension (for those who reached state pension age before April 2016) is £137.60 a week. They may also get a Pension Credit top-up Men and women are now entitled to claim the state pension from 66 - an age which had increased steadily until October last year. Under government plans state pension age would rise to 67 this decade, and 68 as early as 2039. This is based on calculations that ensure no-one spends more than one third of their adult life in retirement. However, since those plans were drawn up, official estimates of longevity have been scaled back, even before the effect of the Covid pandemic. As a result, LCP argues that the move to 67 should not come until 2051, and the rise to 68 not before the mid-2060s. Such an initial move would benefit 20 million people born in the 1960s, 1970s or early 1980s, but cost the Treasury an estimated £200bn. Steve Webb, partner at LCP and a former pensions minister, said: \"The government's plans for rapid increases in state pension age have been blown out of the water by this new analysis. \"Even before the pandemic hit, the improvements in life expectancy which we had seen over the last century had almost ground to a halt, but the schedule for state pension age increases has not caught up with this new world.\" He said the government's plans should be revisited as \"a matter of urgency\" and there was \"no case\" for another state pension age increase so soon. State pension age hits 66 and set to rise further\nTriple lock pension pledge suspended for one year Earlier this month, the Department for Work and Pensions (DWP) announced that the next review of the state pension age would start, headed by Baroness Neville Rolfe. \"The government needs to make sure that decisions on how to manage its costs are, robust, fair and transparent for taxpayers now and in the future. It must also ensure that as the population becomes older, the state pension continues to provide the foundation for retirement planning and financial security,\" the DWP said. Pensions experts have called for a rethink in the way state pension ages are calculated. Baroness Ros Altmann, also a former pensions minister, said the current system helped the healthy and wealthy, but not those likely to die early. \"At the moment, the state pension only has flexibility for those who are healthy and wealthy enough to wait longer. If they start their pension later they can receive a higher amount. But those in poor health with no private provision, cannot get any money sooner, even at a reduced rate,\" she said. Becky O'Connor, head of pensions and savings at Interactive Investor, said: \"The idea of a long, enjoyable retirement seems set to be consigned to the history books. \"Many will have spent much of their working life expecting to retire at 65. They have been disappointed before and look set to be disappointed again. It is no wonder today's younger workers have little faith in the state pension being there for them at all when they stop work, with many thinking they will end up working forever.\" ",

The call comes after plans for the controversial Cambo Oil field off Shetland were put on hold. The letter says any statements calling for an end to new exploration have shaken investor confidence, placing tens of thousands of jobs at risk. It warns politicians against creating a \"hostile investment environment\". The letter, from Aberdeen & Grampian Chamber of Commerce, supported by The British Chambers of Commerce and Scottish Chambers of Commerce, has also been signed by 58 leading figures from business and civic life in Aberdeen. Cambo oil field development to be paused\nJobs warning as Shell pulls out of Cambo oil field\nShell pulls out of Cambo oil field development\nIs a new oil field climate change hypocrisy? It says the economic wellbeing of whole communities across the UK is also being put at risk. The letter adds that the statements calling for an end to new exploration \"threaten the very basis of a fair and inclusive transition at the most crucial point in our collective journey to a net-zero society\". \"A transition, by definition, is a change of state over time,\" it says. \"This is one of the most complex challenges we have faced in our history and it doesn't lend itself to a simple, 'Who's good, who's bad? Who's green, who's not?' approach. To characterise it in this way is overly simplistic. \"We must now pause and allow for a reasoned debate about our energy future to take place. At the same time, we urge politicians to reflect carefully on their public statements on oil and gas and the impact they have on investment in the industry. \"We must not create an adverse policy environment at this crucial moment in our energy transition journey.\" The letter adds that by 2050, the International Energy Agency projects that global oil and gas demand will fall by 80%, but 20 million barrels per day will still be needed. \"Therefore, there is no current future scenario where there is not a requirement for some oil and gas,\" it says. \"Meantime, it continues to be required for people to travel, heat and power their homes and for the manufacture of many everyday goods.\" \"This leaves us with two options; to produce this domestically, with full control over the regulatory environment in which it is extracted; or to import an increasing amount of our energy, with the heavier carbon toll that shipping it from other parts of the world carries. The latter makes little economic sense, and even less environmental sense.\" Russell Borthwick, chief executive of Aberdeen & Grampian Chamber of Commerce, said: \"We have a shared interest in getting to net zero as quickly as possible, but over recent months our region has been portrayed as part of the problem rather than part of the solution. \"The reality is that the skills, people, and experience embedded in the north-east of Scotland have quietly been leading the way in moving the UK towards its net-zero targets, without any intervention from COP26. \"However, turning the North Sea into a hostile investment environment today does nothing to support that transition. In fact, it does the opposite, driving investment and tens of thousands of jobs away to other regions of the world.\" He added that the energy-transition opportunity for Aberdeen could be bigger than the oil and gas industry - but to get there, strong leaders were needed who were willing to \"cut through the noise, see the big picture and get our transition steps in the right order to protect jobs, provide retraining opportunities and create new ones\". Deirdre Michie, chief executive of OGUK, which represents the UK's offshore oil and gas industry, said: \"Right now, we need oil and gas for 73% of our total energy, and so the transition to carbon neutrality will be a huge and complex task. \"We will only be able to achieve it with careful planning by policy-makers who think long-term to develop clear government policies that are then supported by all politicians working together in the national interest. \" She said that for years to come, oil and gas needed to be part of the energy mix. \"It will be far better for the nation and the environment if we source these fuels from around our shores rather than relying on even more imports,\" she added.

            "content": "Chancellor Rishi Sunak is set to meet business leaders for crisis talks on Friday as firms warn of lost bookings. Fears about the Omicron variant of coronavirus have prompted many people to cancel Christmas dinners and parties, hitting businesses. Hospitality firms and business groups have told the chancellor their trading situation was deteriorating rapidly. Mr Sunak said the government would do \"whatever it takes\" to support jobs, but that funding was already available. This includes £250m that has been provided to local authorities for grants to support businesses. It is understood that Mr Sunak will meet with major UK business groups including the Confederation of British Industry (CBI), the British Chambers of Commerce (BCC), the Institute of Directors, Make UK and the Federation of Small Businesses on Friday afternoon. The BCC said it will ask the chancellor to revert VAT for hospitality and tourism business back to the emergency rate of 5%. It also wants the government to reinstate 100% business rates relief for retail \"to give businesses the financial headroom to weather this challenging period\". In addition, it will ask the Treasury to \"make additional grant funding available which can then be administered locally and distributed on a needs basis\". On Thursday Mr Sunak was in California but held a hastily convened call with representatives from business groups and companies including Greene King, Nandos and Whitbread, which owns Premier Inn. Attendees described the chancellor as being in \"listening mode\" and said Mr Sunak appreciated the situation was deteriorating rapidly. The chancellor asked what kind of assistance they were looking for, and there were specific requests for an extension of the discounted VAT rate of 12.5% beyond its scheduled end on 1 April. The participants also requested a deferral of any business rates due in the first quarter of 2022, and grants to businesses in most dire need. Firms plead for help as customers cancel bookings\nHospitality 'takes £1bn hit' on Christmas parties\n'I've had 3,200 bookings cancelled at my pubs' After Thursday's meeting, Mr Sunak flew back to the UK a day early from his US trip where he was meeting technology firms to try to encourage inward investment. Before flying, he said the situation in the UK with Omicron \"is very different to what we've done and encountered before\". \"The government is not telling people to cancel things. It's not closing down businesses.\" Mr Sunak said that it is \"a difficult time for the hospitality industry\" but he said there were existing support measures in place to help the industry. \"Until spring of next year, most businesses in the hospitality industry are only paying a quarter of their normal business rates bill. They are benefiting from a reduced rate of VAT all the way through to next spring. \"And thirdly, there is about quarter of a billion pounds of cash sitting with local authorities that's been provided by government to support those businesses who need it.\" He added that his immediate priority is to make sure that £250m \"gets to those businesses as quickly as possible\". The hospitality industry has warned of a devastating effect of public concern over the rapid spread of the Omicron variant of coronavirus. UKHospitality said pubs, bars and cafes had already seen trade drop by a third, and \"are expecting a further 22% drop in bookings for December\". Kate Nicholls, UKHospitality's chief executive, said: \"Christmas trade is always crucial for the hospitality industry, making up as much as a quarter of the year's profit for many businesses. \"Last year Christmas was cancelled and so much rested on this December period for businesses already staggering under a burden of debt incurred from the pandemic and facing rising costs across the board. \"If operators are unable to trade profitably over the next month, many will simply not survive - and those that do make it through face a return to 20% VAT in April.\" She called for the government to keep VAT at 12.5%, suspend business rates payments for the first quarter of 2022, and reinstate recovery grants. The British Beer & Pub Association warned on Thursday that pubs would sell 37 million fewer pints over Christmas, losing out on £297m. ",

            "header": "Rail fares to rise at fastest pace for nine years",
            "content": "Regulated rail fares in England will rise by 3.8% from March, in the biggest increase for nine years. These regulated prices make up about half of fares and include season tickets on most commuter routes. Increases are normally implemented on the first working day of every year, but have been delayed until March since 2020 due to the coronavirus pandemic. The fare rises are based on the Retail Prices Index (RPI) measure of inflation in July. This time, the government says it will not increase fares by the normal formula of RPI plus 1%, which it used this year when fares went up by 2.6%. Fares for rail services in Northern Ireland are set by state-owned operator Translink, which does not use RPI. The Scottish Government has not announced its plan for 2022. Wales usually matches changes made in England. A Welsh government spokesperson said: \"We are committed to increasing public transport use in Wales and competitively-priced fares are an important way to do this. We are considering the options available to us.\" A 3.8% rise in England would lead to increases in the cost of annual season tickets such as: Brighton to London (any route): Up £194 to £5,302\nLiverpool to Manchester (any route): Up £105 to £2,865 Rail minister Chris Heaton-Harris said: \"[This] strikes a fair balance, ensuring we can continue to invest record amounts into a more modern, reliable railway, ease the burden on taxpayers and protect passengers from the highest RPI in years. \"Delaying the changes until March 2022 offers people the chance to save money by renewing their fares at last year's price.\" Operators are generally expected to match these rises for unregulated fares, although they have been hit hard by the cost of lower passenger numbers during the pandemic. With the cost of living going up, another price rise will inevitably prompt some grimaces - particularly for commuters considering a regular return to the office when the current working-from-home guidance eventually lifts. But demand for traditional season tickets was already falling before lockdowns caused rail usage to plummet. And it is leisure, not commuter use, that has led the recovery so far. The dilemma here is how to attract people back onto the railways, while also trying to address the financial impact of the pandemic on the industry. Raise prices too much and passengers won't want to return. The government says it is protecting people by going with July's RPI figure, even though inflation has risen markedly since then and the increase won't come in until March. The industry says it is trying to adapt to passengers' changing needs. So-called flexible season tickets - effectively a bulk purchase of tickets to be used over a set period - are part of that. Around 100,000 have been bought since they launched in late June. The government said £14bn of taxpayers' money had been spent to keep services running during the pandemic. It said the rise would help meet some of those costs as well as pay for service improvements. Anthony Smith, chief executive of the independent watchdog Transport Focus, said: \"As some fares rise it is even more important that Great British Railways, when it is set up, gives life to the government's ambition to make rail fares better value for money. \"The need to boost passenger numbers and revenue through innovative rail ticket retailing and offers will be vital. Keeping costs under control will also be needed.\" But Louise Haigh, Labour's shadow transport secretary, said: \"This brutal Tory fare hike will be a nightmare before Christmas for millions of passengers. \"Families already facing soaring taxes and bills will now be clobbered with an eye-watering rise in the cost of the daily commute.\" Inflation rose by 5.1% in the 12 months to November, the highest level in a decade, prompting the Bank of England to increase the UK interest rate for the first times in three years. The Department for Transport also announced the Book with Confidence scheme will be extended until the end of March next year. This allows passengers to change their travel plans up until the night before departure, without being charged a fee, or cancel their tickets and receive a refund in the form of rail vouchers. ",

On Thursday, the Treasury Department put the companies on an investment exclusion list, banning US citizens from buying and selling shares in them. It has been alleged that DJI's drone technology has been used for the surveillance of Uyghur Muslims in China. However the ban is largely symbolic as DJI is not a publicly-traded company. Consumers in the US can continue to buy and use DJI drones. In 2020, the Department of Commerce barred US companies from exporting products to DJI, which has been judged to be a national security threat by the Department of Defense. According to the Reuters news agency, more than 900 US public safety agencies including police in New York City use DJI products. The National Park Service has used DJI drones to help fight wildfires in California. The company had close to an 80% market share in consumer drones last year in the US, according to Drone Industry Insights. Telecoms giant Huawei remains on a US trade exclusion list imposed by the Trump administration, barring US companies from doing business with it.

            "content": "Farmdrop, an online company that delivers food direct from farmers and small producers, has gone bust. In an email to customers on Friday morning, the firm said that Thursday was the final day of deliveries - leaving many confused about Christmas. Some suppliers also said they are owed money by Farmdrop but have been unable to get in contact with the firm. Customers, unsure if they have been let down over their Christmas orders, have shared their disappointment online. Customer Kate Marfleet wrote on Twitter that she had been charged for a Christmas order which was supposed to arrive on Friday, while others sought advice about where else they could order in time for 25 December. The BBC is not responsible for the content of external sites.\nView original tweet on Twitter The BBC has contacted Farmdrop for a response. In an email to a customer which was seen by trade magazine The Grocer, Farmdrop advised customers to contact their card suppliers for refunds. \"If you have paid for an order with us, we would recommend getting in touch with your bank or card supplier to initiate a chargeback,\" the email said. Nicola Simons, founder of fruit preserves and chilli jam producer Single Variety Co, said that Farmdrop still owed her £2,200 in unpaid invoices dating back to August. \"It's absolutely shocking, we've sent three reminder invoices for each unpaid invoice and have had no response from their accounts teams,\" she told the BBC. \"It's made me really angry and upset as they were meant to be supporting small suppliers but they've caused us much more harm than good.\" She added: \"They must've seen this coming so why did they continue to order from us, the lack of openness or transparency is appalling.\" Kate Clark, founder of the ice cream and custard company Luscious, also said she is been owed money on invoices from May, despite requests for payment. \"The most appalling part of this story is that they continued ordering from suppliers, ourselves included, (many of us small producers) whilst not paying the outstanding invoices,\" Ms Clark wrote in a Linkedin post. In the email to customers, Farmdrop said it had not been able to secure the \"support and capital\" it needed to survive. The firm wrote that they had aspired to have a great impact by \"influencing change in the food system for the better\". But it said: \"It has become apparent that we have exhausted all possible options. It is with very heavy hearts that we must let you know that we will no longer be able to serve our cherished customers.\" Food firms call on government to fix supply chain\nWhat will happen to all that leftover turkey? According to The Grocer, Farmdrop had 10,000 customers in 2020. At the start of lockdown, Farmdrop saw a surge in demand and its orders doubled. But despite a spike in sales to £12m during the pandemic, in 2021 the company reported pre-tax losses of £10m compared to £11m the previous year. In June last year it secured £6m in funding from investors including Wheatsheaf Group, which is part of the Duke of Westminster's Grosvenor Estate as well as Atomico, a fund that was set-up by Niklas Zennström, the co-founder of Skype. The company, founded nine years ago, had expanded its delivery range last year to a further 2.7 million houses, bringing the total to 7.1 million. Farmdrop had a network of over 450 producers, but Dr Kate McLoughlin, senior lecturer in supply chain management at Manchester Metropolitan University, was unsurprised by the closure amid wider supply chain problems. \"Even if you have the capital pouring in, establishing local supply chains takes time meaning it's hard to respond to such fast increases in demand.\" This is a problem of the wider food system, Dr McLoughlin said, highlighting dramatic increases in transportation costs, fuel prices and driver shortages as possible contributing factors to the firm's closure. \"While they had a huge surge in returning customers, the food system itself is really vulnerable,\" she explained. The rising cost of living, spiking energy prices and worker shortages have all combined to increase the pressures on the food industry throughout the pandemic. Many UK sectors, from petrol stations to supermarkets, have experienced problems with deliveries due to the shortages of lorry drivers. Food firms have struggled to recruit workers, partly due to the pandemic, but this is also compounded by Brexit, according to the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development. Price rises in animal feed coming from abroad have also meant that it is \"not necessarily the suppliers, but their suppliers\" that potentially had issues along the supply chain, said Dr McLoughlin. \"Cost and speed was great for our supply chain but now the free flow of those materials has changed and transitioning to a local economy means shifting how those systems work,\" she said.

            "content": "France is bringing in tougher travel restrictions for travellers arriving from the UK from Saturday as part of efforts to slow the spread of the Omicron variant of coronavirus. The BBC talked to holidaymakers and hoteliers about the effects the tighter restrictions will have on them. Mum of two Anna Baldwin had planned to take her two boys to Disneyland as a Christmas surprise. \"I'm very upset about the French travel ban,\" she said. \"I was devastated.\" The family had booked tests, \"and they're not cheap\", she said. But the main problem was that the trip \"was meant to be a Christmas present for my children and a complete surprise\". Her plans are now up in the air. She says she's already paid out for a fun Christmas, so staying in the UK means extra cost for things such as food. \"If we've got to stay home for Christmas it means, obviously, I've got to do Christmas shopping, so we're a little bit stuck at the moment,\" she said. Anna was pinning her hopes on being able to pick up some flights on Friday to try to get into France before the restrictions come into effect. \"I'm trying to scramble now to look for flights. The only thing is, I'm a little bit nervous. Will we be able to get back?\" Maxine Jones and eleven family members were planning to go to Disneyland. \"It was my present to my children, my grandchildren, and my parents,\" she said. Maxine was \"absolutely devastated\" when she heard the news about the extra French travel restrictions. She had booked a minibus for most of the people on the trip. The plan was to travel to Disneyland on 23 December, and come back on 27 December. \"As you can imagine, everybody was excited,\" she said. Maxine said she had spent more than £11,500 on the trip, \"and I haven't got any of that back yet\". \"Obviously I've got insurance, but it's all going to take time, it's not going to come back overnight\". \"But it was the trip. My mum and dad are 85 and 86, so it would have been nice to go. You don't know if you're going to get that time with them again.\" She adds: \"The worst part is that we just won't be going. Nobody is prepared in my family for Christmas now. Even to the extent that my parents only put up a small Christmas tree this year, and they usually go over the top.\" Pascal Benatar is the owner of the Edelweiss hotel in Pralognon-le-Vanoise in the French Alps. \"We were completely booked for this vacation, and the government announcement changed things,\" he said. \"We have definitely had some cancellations by British people. We hope that for French people it will be OK, and we won't have any cancellations,\" he said. The hotel had been advertised in UK newspapers and from that, five families were booked to come for Christmas. \"They just cancelled this morning because it was not possible to come,\" he said. \"It was terrible for them. They wanted their holidays in France, and in the end, they were not able to travel.\" He said business had been improving over the summer. \"We started this winter with a lot of hope. Just one week before [Christmas] starts, it's a big mess for us. \"It will be a financial problem. We've hired all our team - we have ten staff in a small hotel - and we don't know how to manage that.\" \"The problem is, nobody knows what's going to happen. Three days ago [customers] were speaking to us to arrange ski passes. [Travel restrictions] came just like that - now, no vacation. I'm just sorry for my customers.\" Victor Dapremont, a sales manager for the Mademoiselle Hotel in Paris, said he was \"very surprised\" when the French government tightened travel restrictions. \"It's just another restriction at a very difficult time for us in Parisian hotels,\" he says. By Thursday, about 80% of guests coming from England had cancelled their bookings. It's \"a big impact\" on the business, he said. In a normal year, about a third of guests at the hotel at this time of year are British Victor says the hotel would have to \"modify the price\" of its rooms, and look for customers from countries not facing the same restrictions. \"It's a complete change for us,\" he said. \"We have to adapt economically and strategically.\" ",

            "content": "Clothing sales were back to pre-Covid levels for the first time in November as consumers took advantage of Black Friday and started Christmas shopping early. The Office for National Statistics (ONS) said total UK retail sales rose by 1.4% last month. Demand for fashion rebounded while shoppers also spent in computer stores and on toys and jewellery. But economists warned the lift could be dampened by the emergence of Omicron. Sales of clothing rose by 2.9% in November and were 3.2% higher than February 2020 before the UK entered its first lockdown to stop the spread of Covid. Overall retail sales beat expectations of 0.8% growth and were ahead of a 1.1% rise recorded in October. Five items that are going up in price and why\nWhy is the cost of living going up? Heather Bovill, deputy director for surveys and economic indicators at the ONS, said: \"Clothing stores fared particularly well and have exceeded their pre-pandemic level for the first time. Computer, toy and jewellery retailers also reported robust sales this month.\" However, online sales continued to slip as the economy emerged from lockdown. The proportion of online sales fell to 26.9% in November 2021, its lowest since March 2020. Ms Bovill said more consumers were choosing to visit the High Street and retail parks. Bethany Beckett, UK economist at Capital Economics, said it \"was mainly due to a stronger-than-usual boost from Black Friday and people starting their Christmas shopping early\". But she added: \"That means it was unlikely to last, even before the Omicron outbreak further dampened sales volumes in December.\" Emma-Lou Montgomery, associate director at investment firm Fidelity International, said: \"The lead up to the big day looks to be far from the Christmas bonanza high-street retailers had their hopes pinned on.\" With inflation at a 10-year high, fears around the Omicron variant lowering footfall and ongoing staff shortages, Ms Montgomery said that it's going to be a \"rough ride\" through the next few months for retailers.

            "header": "Turmoil for firms over shortage of labour and goods",
            "content": "Simon Howie has built his butcher's business into a Scottish success story over four decades but now there is a problem. He started in 1986, at the age of 19, opening a small farm shop at the foot of the Ochil Hills before building a firm with a £19m turnover, supplying supermarkets with sausages and a range of other products. But expansion has stalled and Mr Howie blames the UK's \"racist\" immigration rules after leaving the European Union. The company has enough orders to employ 140-150 staff at its factory in Dunning, Perthshire, he explains, but job applications have plummeted since Brexit and the headcount is stuck, stubbornly, at 110. Mr Howie says some 60% of his staff are immigrants and even after raising wages by 20% he is finding it almost impossible to attract workers - local or foreign - to what he calls a \"dirty-hands job\" in rural Scotland. After leaving the EU's single market with its free movement of people, goods, services and capital, he says: \"We are fishing in a smaller pool.\" According to the trade body Scotland Food and Drink, the sector employs some 60,000 people but is short of 10,000 - 11,000 staff at present. It's not just manufacturing. Hospitality is feeling the squeeze too. Before the pandemic, Anna Christopherson employed 120 people in seven bars and restaurants in Edinburgh but lockdowns and other Covid constraints left her chain, Boda Bars, struggling to pay rent and bills. Now just two venues and 21 workers remain and she is still struggling to source enough staff and supplies to keep them going. \"It's been horrendous,\" says Ms Christopherson, who is also dealing with a wave of Christmas cancellations because of the latest Covid restrictions. Serving those who do turn up has often been tricky because of sporadic shortages. Ms Christopherson reels off a long and varied list of affected products: draught beer, carbon dioxide, tequila, wine, glass bottles, corks, even eggs and milk have all been hit, she says. The reasons are complex and global and appear to include clogged up ports, rising costs of shipping, driver shortages and new bureaucracy relating to EU imports. \"Brexit has been massive,\" says Ms Christopherson. \"We're going to see that for the rest of our lives, I think.\" The Big Top toy shop in Glasgow is also struggling with stock. Owner Alexis Alexander says some of her suppliers insisted on orders for Christmas being placed much earlier than usual. Even so she has faced delay, disruption and disappointment. The shelves in her brightly coloured store are not exactly bare but in mid-December they should be groaning with traditional teddies, a festive favourite. Instead only 50 bears have arrived from an order of 200 which she placed in June. \"You run the risk of running out of things entirely and you can't sell air on the shelves,\" says Ms Alexander who sources 70% of her products from continental Europe. She thinks leaving the trading bloc has resulted in less flexibility and higher customs costs but she also suspects Brexit and the pandemic are being used as \"cover-all\" excuses by inefficient firms which should have adapted to both challenges by now. Josie Dent, managing economist at the Centre for Economics and Business Research, thinks it is unfair to blame the current turmoil on Brexit. \"We've seen significant frictions with the world reopening and demand increasing and supply not being able to match,\" she says. \"A lot of countries are experiencing these kinds of issues completely unrelated to Brexit,\" she adds. In the end, many Brexit supporters insist, we will end up with more employment opportunities for British workers as a result of leaving the EU. A month before the EU referendum in 2016 Boris Johnson said voting leave would mean a jobs bonanza — a \"huge world of opportunity and prosperity\" in his words. \"After we liberate ourselves from the shackles of Brussels we will be able to create hundreds of thousands of new jobs right across the UK,\" he said. If Boda Bars' experience is anything to go by, we do not appear to be there yet. The group is finding recruitment incredibly difficult even after putting up wages. \"We've been looking for a chef here since June,\" says Anna Christopherson. Perhaps for those who do remain in the country - and for local workers - the pandemic has made serving salad and spritzers less attractive. That's certainly the case for Shayna Alnwick, from the US state of Georgia. Before the virus shook up everything she was working as a waitress in a British steakhouse. \"Obviously we cannot serve steak through Zoom calls,\" she says. Instead she is sanding a chest of drawers in a small spare room in the west end of Glasgow having switched careers to become a social media star whose DIY videos have won her hundreds of thousands of followers. Covid, she says, meant lower tips, masks all day, and grumpy customers. \"Everybody was always on edge,\" says Ms Alnwick. Her story illustrates the extent to which the most dramatic disruption to our lives since World War Two has upended the economy. According to the Fraser of Allander Institute's Scottish Business Monitor survey, 60% of firms had vacancies in the third quarter of this year, and 86% of those said they were finding it difficult or very difficult to fill the posts. More than two-thirds of companies said wages were higher in July - September than they had been in the previous three months. The optimistic view is that we are in a process of creative destruction which will eventually settle down, with surviving companies slimmer and more efficient; innovative new firms born from the ashes; and a happier and more productive workforce. \"We're still optimistic for the underlying economic situation,\" says Ms Dent. Campbell Mickel is not convinced. He has shut two of his three businesses in Edinburgh - a fishmonger's and a restaurant - and doesn't see any immediate respite. Waiting for a delivery of octopus and squid outside his remaining fish shop in Marchmont, he insists Brexit is to blame for cutting the pool of young foreign students willing to work in the UK. \"We need the Spaniards and the French and the Portuguese,\" he says, insisting that the students he used to employ worked hard, contributed to society and paid their taxes. \"They didn't come over here to sit on their butts,\" he says. \"I don't care how much 'Dunkirk spirit' we put behind this,\" he says, scathingly. \"This is a catastrophic failure. They have to open the borders.\" Agriculture is also facing a labour shortage and inflationary pressures, according to Robin Traquair, vice-president of the National Farmers Union of Scotland, who owns a pig farm near Dalkeith, Midlothian. The animals eat wheat and barley which have risen in price plus there is a shortage of abattoir staff, which means pigs staying in their pens for longer. \"Not only are pigs being held back,\" says Mr Traquair, but while they are on the farm \"they're eating more expensive food\". The UK government insists it is trying to help. A spokesperson told the BBC it was \"maximising the benefits of Brexit through our points-based immigration system,\" with \"butchers, processors and dressers...all eligible for the Skilled Worker visa route under the new system.\" Ministers were \"helping people across the country retrain, build new skills and get back into work,\" the spokesperson added. Mr Traquair accepts that the solution to some of the shortages may lie in Scotland but he reckons that will come at a cost. \"Longer term, we're going have to train people up, local people,\" he says, adding \"the consequence is that there will be food price inflation.\" ",

            "content": "Turkey has cut interest rates again, despite red hot inflation and a worsening currency crisis. Its central bank cut borrowing costs for the fourth straight month amid continued pressure from President Recep Tayyip Erdogan. The lira fell as much as 5.7% to a record low following the decision. The president also announced a 50% hike in the country's minimum wage to 4,250 lira per month ($275; £206) in a bid to offset the impact of rising prices. He believes pushing interest rates lower will help alleviate red-hot inflation. It is a view that runs contrary to conventional economic theory. In a statement, Turkey's bank compared its decision to those of other major Western central banks, which have kept rates low during the coronavirus pandemic to help boost economic growth. By Victoria Craig, BBC business correspondent President Erdogan wants a high growth, low interest-rate environment. He thinks it will stimulate the economy and create jobs, fuel investment in the country because it keeps borrowing costs low. But, the problem is the currency crisis - caused in part by a loss in trust with policymakers - has caused the opposite to happen. Economic growth is still high here: Turkey is considered an emerging market, and the past few decades have been powered by credit-fuelled growth in sectors like construction. The economic turmoil is hitting people from all walks of life. Locals are coping by just taking one day at a time but there is a lot of anger and frustration here. Everyone we spoke to says they are regularly monitoring the lira's exchange rate with not just the dollar, but also with the euro, the pound, and with gold. Why currency crash does not worry Turkey's Erdogan Over the past year, it has become increasingly difficult for Turks to plan, save, or spend money on everyday goods and services. Protests have been breaking out in the capital Ankara and in the biggest city of Istanbul. The president and his allies says that lower interest rates will boost Turkish exports, investment and jobs. But many economists say the rate cuts are reckless. Last month, the country's inflation rate hit 21.7%. Normally, central banks raise rates to combat rising prices, but Mr Erdogan has called such tools \"the mother and father of all evil\". Although the bank has attempted to bolster the value of the lira by using its dollar reserves to buy the currency, analysts have said it does not have enough firepower to stop the slide. ",

            "header": "Millions more get fibre broadband but take-up lags",
            "content": "Eight million UK homes now have access to full-fibre broadband, a record rise of three million since last year. But fewer than a quarter of those have chosen to upgrade to a full-fibre package, regulator Ofcom's annual Connected Nations report says. Many could upgrade without paying more than they currently did, Ofcom said. The number of upgrades was rising, with 750,000 homes moving to full-fibre services in 2021, but the rapid rollout meant take-up was likely to lag behind. Uswitch.com telecoms expert Ernest Doku said: \"Taking full fibre infrastructure to eight million households is an impressive achievement - but it is sobering to think that fewer than two million are actually taking advantage of these connections.\" The report reveals 47% of homes - 13.7 million - now have 1GBps-capable broadband, provided by full-fibre or the latest coaxial cable networks. But it is based on data before the announcement of Virgin Media's upgrade, which would push the figure past 15 million to \"around 65%\" of homes. In theory, 1GBps speeds would allow a feature film to be downloaded in less than a minute, Ofcom said. The UK government has set a target of at least 85% 1GBps coverage by 2025. Digital Secretary Nadine Dorries said the report showed \"major progress on our commitment to deliver a digital infrastructure revolution\". The report also found no let up in the increasing appetite for data among broadband consumers. Average monthly data usage now stands at 453GB per connection, up from 429GB last year and 315GB in 2019. \"Whilst peak usage remains in the evening, networks continued to see high demand during the day due to continued working from home,\" the report says. But 123,000 homes and businesses are still without access to a decent broadband connection, the report estimates. And Ofcom says it will work with the government on solving this problem, which could involve new wireless technologies and \"the latest generation of satellites, which could offer good broadband services in rural areas not covered by other network deployments\". Half of properties in the UK were now in an area with outdoor 5G coverage, the report found. Consumer take-up of 5G remained \"relatively modest\", at about 10% of all active devices. But uptake was increasing, Ofcom said, with 800,000 active 5G devices in the UK in 2020 rising to more than six million handsets in September 2021. The report also highlights a number of projects launched last year to improve reception and connectivity on trains, overground and underground, which Ofcom acknowledges can be poor. The UK's mobile network operators also had to adapt to changing consumer behaviour caused by Covid-19. \"One associated consequence of Covid-19 was an increased emphasis on UK holidays,\" the report says, \"which also led to increased demand in certain rural locations.\" Operators responded to this change by deploying new sites and upgrading capacity. \"As a result, some operators fast-tracked key coastal towns for significant capacity upgrades, with at least 80 new deployments reported,\" the report says. Technology problems at three companies, Fastly, Akamai and Facebook, had a significant impact on consumers accessing online services this year, the report notes. And the UK community of smaller voice over internet protocol (VoIP) service providers faced a persistent and sector-wide cyber-attack, \"the objective of which has been to extort a fee from each of the operators who have been attacked, in order to secure relief from future attacks for a period of 12 months\". Ofcom said it was working with the government and the National Cyber Security Centre on the response to the attacks. ",

On Saturday, Kronos confirmed it was dealing with a ransomware attack on its computer systems. Many companies such as Sainsbury's rely on Kronos to log, store and process the hours employees have worked. The supermarket chain is understood to have lost a week's worth of data for its 150,000 UK employees. But it said they would be paid before Christmas. Multiple departments, including payroll, human resources (HR) and accounting are now using historical data and working patterns to make sure employees are paid the correct amount on time. A ransomware attack is when hackers gain access to a computer network and encrypt valuable data, asking for a ransom to make it useable again. A Sainsbury's spokeswoman said: \"We're in close contact with Kronos while they investigate a systems issue. \"In the meantime, we have contingencies in place to make sure our colleagues continue to receive their pay.\" Kronos, run by the UKG company, from Massachusetts, supplies a range of cloud payroll services, including an automated payment system. Some services would be offline for several weeks, it said, and customers should \"evaluate and implement alternative business continuity protocols\". US supermarket chain Wholefoods and carmaker Honda North America use Kronos and were among those affected, NBC news reported. Honda UK told BBC News it was unaffected. A UKG official told BBC News: \"UKG recently became aware of a ransomware incident that has disrupted the Kronos Private Cloud, which houses solutions used by a limited number of our customers.\" It had taken immediate action to investigate and mitigate the issue, alerted affected customers and informed the authorities \"We recognise the seriousness of the issue and have mobilised all available resources to support our customers and are working diligently to restore the affected services,\" UKG added.

            "content": "McDonald's has settled a lawsuit in which its former chief executive, Steve Easterbook, has returned equity awards and cash worth over $105m. The fast food chain had claimed that Mr Easterbrook hid and lied about sexual relationships with three staff. Mr Easterbrook apologised for failing to uphold the firm's values and fulfil his responsibilities. The British businessman, 54, initially received the $105m in a severance package in 2019. He was fired in November that year, after admitting to having had a consensual relationship with one employee. At the time, McDonald's said Mr Easterbrook had \"violated company policy\" and shown \"poor judgement\". But further investigation uncovered two more hidden relationships and the firm said that, had it been aware of this, it would not have approved his multi-million dollar pay-off. McDonald’s in US hiring 14-year-olds amid shortage\nUS McDonald's workers strike again over harassment\nMcDonald's restaurants offer childcare to staff \"This settlement holds Steve Easterbrook accountable for his clear misconduct, including the way in which he exploited his position as CEO,\" McDonald's chairman Enrique Hernandez Jr said on Thursday. \"Today's resolution avoids a protracted court process and moves us beyond a chapter that belongs in our past.\" In July 2019, an anonymous tip-off led investigators to find that Mr Easterbrook had sent sexually explicit photographs of three employees to his personal email from his company address. Investigators also found messages showing that he approved a grant of company shares worth hundreds of thousands of dollars to one of the employees \"shortly after their first sexual encounter\". McDonald's said it had not initially found the photos and messages because Mr Easterbrook had deleted them from his phone. It claimed Mr Easterbrook violated his duty to the company by lying when asked about his behaviour in an effort to secure a bigger severance package, committing fraud. But Mr Easterbrook's lawyers called the suit \"meritless\", claiming McDonald's had details about his relationships on its computer systems at the time it negotiated the severance deal. The case has come as McDonald's faces scrutiny over alleged sexual harassment in its restaurants. In April, the chain announced it would implement new training at its 39,000 restaurants to prevent harassment and promote safe and respectful workplaces. The majority of its restaurants are run by franchisees, who will be required to meet the new safer workplace standards starting in January 2022. The announcement came after it faced lawsuits by some female employees. Mr Easterbrook, 54, first worked for McDonald's in 1993 as a manager in London before working his way up the company. He left in 2011 to become boss of Pizza Express and then Asian food chain Wagamama, before returning to McDonald's in 2013, eventually becoming its chief executive in 2015. ",

            "header": "Interest rates rise for first time in three years",
            "content": "The Bank of England has raised interest rates for the first time in more than three years, in response to calls to tackle surging price rises. The increase to 0.25% from 0.1% followed data this week that showed prices climbing at the fastest pace for 10 years. It came despite fears the Omicron variant could slow the economy by causing people to spend less. The Bank's action is set to increase the mortgage costs of some homeowners. Bank governor Andrew Bailey said it needed to tackle strong inflationary pressures building up in the economy. Inflation is now running at 5.1%, the highest in a decade, and he expects it to rise further early next year. \"In the short term - that is, in the next two or three months - we think it can get to around 6%,\" he told the BBC. A rise in wholesale gas prices is still a big factor driving inflation, and that is continuing to push up domestic energy bills. But one business group said the interest rate rise would do little to stop prices going up, since costs were being pushed higher by global factors largely outside the Bank's control. The decision by the Bank of England will add just over £15 to the typical monthly repayment for a tracker mortgage customer. A standard variable rate mortgage-holder is likely to pay nearly £10 extra a month. Nearly two million people in the UK have one of these two types of mortgage. While savers may welcome news of higher rates, analysts warn there is no guarantee the higher Bank rate will lead to better returns on savings. Even if savings rates increase slightly, returns are still well below the rate of inflation. How will the interest rate rise affect you?\nHow do interest rates affect your money?\nWhy is the cost of living going up? The Bank can raise interest rates to help control price rises - but many experts had expected it to hold off because of uncertainty about Omicron. Yet on Thursday, it said the prices of global assets, such as stocks and bonds, had largely recovered after an initial fall triggered by news of the new variant. Successive waves of Covid also appeared to have had less impact on economic growth, the Bank added, although there was uncertainty around the extent to which that would prove to be the case this time. \"Consumer price inflation in advanced economies has risen by more than expected,\" the Bank said. The Omicron variant could reduce economic activity early next year, said the Bank, although it was unclear how much of an effect it would have on inflation worldwide. Mr Bailey told the BBC the Bank's rate-setters had thought \"long and hard\" about the impact of Omicron on economic activity before making their decision. \"But it is not at all clear if the impact [on the economy] could cause inflation to come down, or even go up,\" he said. The Bank of England seems to like a surprise. Last month, acknowledging the expectation of an interest rate rise happening, it held off. This month, with the main development being the spread of Omicron, it has raised at a time when most expected it to hold. It goes to show that the arguments have been finely balanced. The other development has been that inflation has hit even harder and even faster than expected. Six per cent is now the expected peak in the spring, which will represent the highest rate of inflation on the targeted CPI measure for 30 years. It is treble the Bank of England's target. While it is important to note that a 0.15% rise is modest and still leaves base rates very close to historic lows, it is not ideal that this comes at the precise moment where some forms of consumer confidence, especially in terms of going out, appear to be slumping. The Bank's Monetary Policy Committee was briefed by the Chief Medical Officer, Chris Whitty, and intriguingly chose to mention the possibility that Omicron could raise inflationary pressure by further hobbling supply chains for goods, and the supply of workers. The argument will be that it is better to nip expectations of inflation in the bud, than try to contain them once they get going. A rise now is preferable, in the eyes of the MPC, to having to rise by even more over the next year or two. The Bank is choosing to act on what it knows about inflation, rather than hold back on what it doesn't know about Omicron. Not at all. The Bank's Monetary Policy Committee (MPC) voted 8-1 in favour of the increase. The dissenting MPC member, Silvana Tenreyro, voted to keep rates as they were. Rates had been at 0.1%, a record low, since March last year, when they were cut in response to the effects of the coronavirus pandemic. It was the second month in a row that Bank policymakers had surprised the markets. Economists had expected a rate rise at the MPC's last meeting in November, but policymakers voted to hold fire. This time, analysts expected a further delay because of Omicron, but the committee thought differently. \"The Bank of England's decision to raise interest rates was surprising, given mounting uncertainty over the economic impact of the Omicron variant,\" said Suren Thiru, head of economics at the British Chambers of Commerce. \"While today's rate increase may have little effect on most firms, many will view this as the first step in a longer policy movement - not as a partial reversal of last year's cut.\" He added that the current inflationary spike was mostly driven by global factors, so higher interest rates would do little to curb further increases in inflation. Instead, the government needed to find practical solutions to the UK's supply chain problems and labour shortages, he said. Paul Dales, chief UK economist at Capital Economics, said the move suggested that the Bank had become \"a bit more hawkish\" and might now think rates need to rise further than before. \"The MPC once again said that a 'modest tightening' of monetary policy is likely to be necessary, so this is not looking like a case of one and done,\" he added. \"We still think that weaker economic growth and a faster fall in inflation will mean that interest rates won't rise to 1% by the end of next year, but it's just become more likely that they rise above our 0.5% forecast.\" The MPC also voted unanimously to maintain the Bank's asset purchase scheme at £875bn. The last time the Bank raised interest rates was in August 2018, when they reached 0.75%. They were then cut twice in March 2020 at the start of the pandemic.

            "header": "A380: Last of the superjumbos handed to new owner",
            "content": "The final Airbus A380 ever to be built has been handed over to its new owners, the Dubai-based carrier Emirates. It is a landmark moment. The giant of the skies will continue to fly, but its long-term future remains uncertain. Emirates, which owns roughly half of the A380 fleet, looks set to continue using it for many years to come. But several other airlines stopped using their plane during the pandemic, and some have already been scrapped. The A380 is the world's largest passenger jet. In standard configuration, it carries 545 passengers - although in theory it can carry a maximum of 853. The double-decker colossus has four engines, an 80-metre wingspan and a maximum take-off weight of 560 tonnes. It is also very complex - containing around 530km (330 miles) of wiring. Yet according to Alex Scerri, a former A380 Captain, it is remarkably easy to fly. \"Airbus have managed to engineer the A380 so that it feels just like a much smaller plane like the A320,\" he says. \"It's remarkably nimble, and it really doesn't feel like a 600-tonne aircraft.\" The project was conceived in the early 1990s. The A380 was meant to be a symbol of European industrial prowess, a flagship for the Airbus fleet to surpass Boeing's 747 jumbo. At the time, it was widely assumed that major airport hubs around the world would become more and more congested as cities grew and air traffic multiplied. This would create a market for very large planes which could carry more passengers without increasing the number of flights. By the time the A380 made its first commercial flight in 2007, however, the seeds of its demise had already been sown. While Airbus engineers struggled to get the superjumbo onto the market, Boeing was quietly marketing long range versions of its economical twin-engine 777 - and developing the 787 Dreamliner. The 787 was a design which made the most of advances in engine technology, as well as in composite materials and aerodynamics. The result was an aircraft that was much more efficient than previous models, used less fuel and was therefore cheaper to run. Together with Airbus' own A350, launched a few years later, it changed the shape of the market. Instead of using giant planes to transport huge numbers of people between 'hub' airports, before placing them on connecting flights to other destinations, airlines could now fly smaller planes on less crowded direct routes between smaller cities which would previously have been unviable. Compared with these new designs, the four-engine A380 was expensive to buy and costly to run. \"The technology on the A380 was basically from the 1980s,\" says Peter Morris, chief economist at the aviation consultancy Ascend by Cirium. \"It was frozen into the design before the step-change in aircraft technology - before carbon composites and highly efficient engines\". As a result, Airbus struggled to sell it. Only 251 planes were ever built, and the programme struggled to break even - let alone recoup the more than $25bn invested in it. Yet according to Airbus executive Philippe Muhn, the project still brought significant benefits to the organisation, which had developed from a grouping of manufacturers from different countries. \"This was an aircraft that allowed the company to integrate, from a technical standpoint, industrial standpoint, and culturally as well\", he explains. \"And then of course all the investment in the A380 technology was the foundation of what the A350 is today.\" But, while it may have been a commercial failure for Airbus, the superjumbo has clearly been a success for its primary customer. Emirates used it to create a global network of high-density, long-haul routes centred on its base in Dubai. That helped it to become one of the world's largest airlines. \"For Emirates it created a niche in the market\", explains Peter Morris. \"Without the A380, I contend that Emirates would never have reached the level that it did. They managed to make something which helped build the prestige of Dubai, and created a market for the plane as well. It did work.\" But for other airlines, the superjumbo was less of a success. Filling all of those seats could be a challenge - and when the Covid pandemic hit, virtually the entire fleet was grounded. While some carriers are now bringing them back, others, such as Lufthansa and Air France have decided to retire their fleets for good. That raises the question of what will happen to the unused planes. In theory, they could fly for decades. But according to Ascend by Cirium, the second-hand market for such large aircraft is \"small to non-existent\". It is likely, then, that more A380s will simply go to the scrapyard, following the seven that have already reportedly been sent. But others will remain in service. Emirates, which now has 123 A380s, says it will continue to fly them for the next two decades - though over time their number is likely to shrink as newer planes are brought in. However long it continues to fly, aviation historian Shea Oakley thinks the superjumbo has already sealed its place in history. \"Tragically for Airbus, they built a technological masterpiece, but they chose the wrong vision. It was a fine aircraft, but the wrong choice for the times\", he says. \"I'm not sure there will ever be a larger commercial aircraft than the A380.\" ",

            "content": "Business groups are increasing pressure on the government to assist firms suffering from the rise in Covid cases. The CBI urged ministers to provide support \"in lockstep with future restrictions\", while UK Hospitality called for business rates to be deferred and VAT discounts extended. The spread of the Omicron variant has hit consumer confidence and seen hospitality bookings cancelled. Labour urged further support for firms, but the government has so far declined. But the chancellor will meet with representatives from the hospitality sector on Thursday to discuss their concerns. 'One by one they have all been testing positive'\n'I've had 3,200 bookings cancelled at my pubs'\nWhat are the Christmas rules this year? The UK government and devolved administrations have not placed any additional restrictions on businesses, such as lockdowns or reduced group sizes for restaurants or bars, but many firms have seen a collapse in customers at a time when they hope to recoup lost earnings. On Wednesday, Prime Minister Boris Johnson advised people to \"think carefully before you go\" out to socialise. The UK's chief medical officer Prof Chris Whitty also urged people not to \"mix with people you don't have to\". The hospitality industry has estimated December takings will be down by 40% - with the damage up to twice that in London. This has prompted UK Hospitality to ask for an extension of the discounted 12.5% VAT rate to stretch beyond its scheduled end in March 2022, and for business rates due in the first quarter of next year to be deferred. Celebrity chef Tom Kerridge told the BBC one of his restaurants had 654 cancellations in the past six days, during a time of year for the industry which is trying to \"claw our way back to some sort of normality\". He said bar and restaurant owners \"wouldn't have a problem\" if they had to close from a \"government and scientific point of view\" because of Covid, as long as financial support was put in place. But, he added: \"It feels like there's a reactive approach to the situation rather than thinking of being proactive. \"If you're telling people to work from home, which I get and I understand, there's a knock-on effect on many businesses that are reliant on lunch trade... the coffee shop round the corner, the newsagent in the city, hairdressers and nail bars. \"There are so many different places that will be unable to cope. Getting shut down without financial support, a lot of places will close their doors and will not re-open in the new year.\" Patrick Dardis, chief executive of pub chain Youngs, said that widespread cancellations and no extra government support would mean hospitality closures in January. \"I think people are terribly confused and it's certainly having a significant impact,\" he told the BBC's Today programme. These Christmas weeks were critical for businesses \"hanging on by their fingernails\", he added. Youngs, which has 80% of its pubs in London, was helped by the reduction in VAT last lockdown and Mr Dardis called on the government to hold VAT for the hospitality sector at the reduced rate of 12.5% and lower business rates. Sam Morgan, who owns restaurants Craft and 8, said his businesses had seen a \"rapid decline\" in bookings, with more than 600 cancellations. \"We've got a perfect storm,\" he said. \"Consumer confidence is low, meaning future bookings or bookings to replace current cancellations are low. \"Corporate customers are cancelling Christmas and New Year bookings due to nervousness around exposing customers to risk, and staff having members of their parties becoming ill, meaning they must isolate.\" Mr Morgan said the situation was \"extremely worrying\", with revenue earned from the festive period used to cover less busy times in the first months of the year. The CBI has called for an instruction from the government to tell councils to immediately release unused grants and rates relief to businesses in need. Conservative MP Anne Marie Morris tweeted that if the government was \"effectively telling people not to visit hospitality venues this Christmas\", then financial support should be provided. Baroness Ruby McGregor-Smith, president of the British Chambers of Commerce, said businesses faced a \"two-punch combination of serious issues with staff absence and plummeting consumer confidence\". \"Not even a rationale has been provided for why it believes no new support is required. They deserve better. \"Many of these firms, who have survived nearly two years of challenging trading conditions, are now seeing their vital festive income melt away in front of their eyes.\" Nick Farr, co-owner of Hertfordshire brewery Farr Brew, which owns six pubs, says it has been hit with around 450 cancellations in the past seven to 10 days and this has had a \"devastating\" impact. \"Yesterday one of our pubs - The Bull in Whitwell - we had a table of 15 booked, they were booked in for 12 o'clock, they literally cancelled at 9 o'clock. So that's a lot of turkey going to waste, a lot of prep done undertaken by the chefs the night before. All of that money goes to waste really.\" He said if the government was asking people to limit socialising then they had to step in. \"Unless they are OK with literally dozens of thousands of pubs going under then they just simply have to put a very extensive package of financial aid back into place,\" he told the BBC. Rain Newton-Smith, CBI chief economist, said implementing Plan B measures was \"the right thing to do\", but added it had \"dented\" demand and consumer confidence and further support for struggling firms would be needed in future measures were brought in. \"The Omicron variant is unlikely to be the final challenge the coronavirus poses the economy or the country. So, the question is: how do we learn to live confidently not just with the virus, but with its variants?\" In parliament on Thursday, Labour's shadow chief secretary to the Treasury, Pat McFadden, questioned why further government support measures had not been approved given the chief medical officer's advice to \"de-prioritise social contact\". He also criticised the chancellor for proceeding with a ministerial trip to California on Tuesday while the country faced a \"tidal wave\" of Omicron. The chancellor is due to speak to hospitality leaders by video link today, and again tomorrow upon his return to the UK. A Treasury spokesman said: \"As we have done throughout the pandemic, we are closely monitoring the impact of the virus on the economy - and particularly the hospitality sector which is why the Chancellor is meeting with representatives from the industry today. \"Our £400bn Covid support package will continue to help businesses well into spring next year and of course we will continue to respond proportionately to the changing path of the virus.\" Is your business facing a number of cancellations?

            "content": "Supermarkets Marks & Spencer and Aldi are locked in a legal spat for the second time this year - this time over bottles of gin that light up. M&S has gone to the High Court seeking an injunction against alleged infringement of its design. The retailer says Aldi's blackberry and clementine gin liqueur is \"strikingly similar\" to its own Light Up gin. It follows 'Caterpillargate' in April, when M&S alleged Aldi's Cuthbert cake copied its Colin the Caterpillar cake. Both retailers' gins come in a bell-shaped bottle with a light in the base, which illuminates edible gold flakes in the liquid. The Aldi gin is about £6 cheaper than the basic £20 M&S version. Legal filings by M&S at the High Court earlier this month claim Aldi's products \"constitute designs which do not produce on the informed user a different overall impression to the [M&S] designs\". M&S cites media reports comparing the products as evidence of similarity. The action concerns alleged infringement of a specific registered M&S design that was on sale last year, not the similar globe bottles currently available. An M&S spokesperson said: \"M&S has a proud history as a leading British innovator and for over 136 years customers have turned to M&S for unique, original, quality products - conceived, created and developed by us working with our trusted suppliers and produced to the highest standards.\" The firm cited several firsts, including the first chilled chicken kiev, the introduction of pre-packed sandwiches, and glitter gin globes. M&S said: \"So, like many other UK businesses, large and small, we know the true value and cost of innovation and the enormous time, passion, creativity, energy and attention to detail, that goes into designing, developing and bringing a product to market and building its brand over many years. \"We will always seek to protect our reputation for freshness, quality, innovation and value - and protect our customers from obvious copies.\" In April, the hashtag Caterpillargate began trending on Twitter after M&S started High Court action - which is ongoing - over cake. Aldi teased M&S on social media with a 'freecuthbert' campaign and dubbed the 136-year-old M&S 'Marks & Snitches'. The BBC has asked Aldi for comment. ",

            "header": "What is behind Scottish home price inflation?",
            "content": "Scottish home price inflation is ahead of any region of England, and taking starter properties out of the reach of many who wish to get on the property ladder.\nThe lack of supply is part of the reason, but also the post-lockdown desire to get more space, and out of the city. The cost of buying a home in Scotland has risen by an average of £18,000 in the year to October, or 11.3%. That's according to the monthly figures issued by the Office for National Statistics (ONS). That draws on property transaction details filed with Registers of Scotland, which buyers are obliged to do within weeks, and it represents an easing of the inflation rate that was seen in the preceding months. Although it's usually a quiet month for transactions, August saw a 16% increase on the previous year. If you go back to that previous year, the market was distorted by pent-up demand from the months when viewing homes was banned, and it was near impossible to buy or sell them. In October last year, 13,000 homes were sold. October 2021 was down to 9,600. Property is just one of the prices on the rise. The basket of consumer goods that are combined to give us the UK consumer price index was 5.1% more expensive in November this year than the year before. The reasons are various, but most come down to the word \"disruption\" - of markets, of supply chains, labour shortages and power play in the global energy markets. The latest rumblings between Russia and its European customers for gas have this week seen a further spike in wholesale prices, to reach new record levels, which will feed through to the capped price when it is next allowed to rise in April. The ONS does not publish a breakdown of different inflation rates for the nations and regions of the UK. But the National Institute of Economic and Social Research does give that a try, with its monthly tracker. Stripping out the biggest and smallest changes, to remove distortions, it reckons that Scotland has the same inflation rate as the UK as a whole, with London significantly higher. There are expectations that the inflation rate will continue to rise until a peak in April, when the energy price cap is raised. That's the same month National Insurance Contributions go up, hitting payroll deductions. And council tax is likely to rise, with the brakes removed by the Scottish government. But property has continued to surge ahead of other costs. Average UK prices are 41% higher than they were only six years ago. The problem, agrees everyone in the industry, is the strong level of demand but weak level of supply. Simple economics tells you what's going to happen next, or you can try buying a home yourself, and you'll probably find out quite quickly. Having started with lots of statistics, let's assume you don't mind reading some more, indicating how the property market has been functioning, or failing to: The most recent figures show price inflation on detached homes has been nearly double the rate for flats - 15.9% to 8.1%. This appears to reflect one trend in the market towards getting more space, and getting out of cities. People working from home now have the option of moving further from their employers' work bases.\nThe price of the average semi-detached house sale was up 12.1% in the year, terraced homes were up 10.6%, to an average £152,000.\nThe average detached home was selling for £325,000 in October, and the average flat for £126,000 (you may have noticed that I'm doing some rounding of numbers).\nThe average first-time buyer was paying £145,000 for that starter home, up by 9.9%, or an average £13,000. Those who had previously owned homes saw a sharper 12.6% increase, to an average £220,000.\nNew-build homes have been rising in price at a faster rate, up 28% to £274,000, while existing properties were up to £176,000. That might be partly explained by the vigour with which housebuilders were trying to restart the market immediately after the first lockdown, by offering attractive prices.\nAnd Scotland's property market is seeing stronger price inflation than any of England's regions. The UK rate was up by 10.2%, falling slightly between September and October. Although it has by far the most expensive properties, with the average just above £500,000, London's rate of increase is the most subdued. Wales saw prices rise in the year to October by 15.5%. One other piece of economic research, just published by the Bank of England, tries to isolate the impact of the lockdown effect - people wanting to move home to get more space, or to get out of the city. Viewed from the City of London, getting out of the city means getting out of London. They compare price inflation for flats with houses of similar size, and compare the price inflation in London with outside the metropolis. What they conclude is that this effect accounts for nearly half the surge in prices that we've seen. The rest? That lack of supply remains part of the story. Plus, perhaps, a rush to get onto the first rung of the property ladder before it is lifted out of reach. And making use of the surge in savings squirrelled away while we haven't had so much to spend on travel or hospitality over the past 20 months. Those savings, earning next to nothing in savings accounts, are now losing spending power at a rate of 5.1% - so that's another incentive to find something to invest them in, and in Britain, property remains a popular choice.

            "content": "The shortage of lorry drivers is causing high-profile disruption for businesses this year, but the logistics industry is struggling to recruit for warehouse roles too. With companies in the middle of their busiest time of the year, BBC News went to one Bedfordshire firm to see how it was coping. Zsolt Oldal is a production supervisor at Ark-H Handling near Bedford and says Christmas is the busiest time of year for the business. He says: \"Normally at this time of the year all of our clients are running promotions so it is busier. \"Obviously we can feel the effect of Covid but we are two or three times busier than normal.\" He says the pandemic has meant the firm has \"seen an increase in e-commerce but less in retail and business to business\". The company is \"prepared\" for the festive period, he says, admitted \"it does feel pressured\" but is confident the staff will cope. Neil Horton, the commercial director at Ark-H Handling says recruitment is \"quite a significant challenge\". He says the issue is \"both finding the right people with the right skill set and with the attitude to a really good job for our clients\". Mr Horton admitted pay is a factor in recruiting staff but also says the industry needs to do work so \"employees understand the career opportunities\". In areas like Bedford, with links to the M1, A1 and A6, warehousing and logistics is a growing industry, which means competition for employees. \"It's about finding a way to differentiate ourselves from other employers by offering things such as training and career opportunities,\" he says. Trade group Logistics UK said it expects to see fewer deliveries throughout December due to the continuing shortage of drivers and other logistics workers Elizabeth de Jong, policy director at the group, said it could result in smaller ranges of products and difficulties restocking. Earlier this year, Next chief executive Lord Wolfson warned warehouse and logistics staffing was \"beginning to come under pressure\". \"We anticipate that, without some relaxation of immigration rules, we are likely to experience some degradation in our service in the run up to Christmas,\" the Conservative-peer said. The government said companies should focus on the UK workforce and make employment more attractive to domestic workers. Sam Bartholomew is a production executive at Ark-H Handling and says the job gives him \"a good foot in the door in the logistics industry\". He says: \"It's somewhere I want to go further in, so getting my feet on the ground is the best way to do it.\" The job, he says, is \"very fast paced\" and it gives him \"experience in lots of different things, logistics, IT, and working to deadlines\". Mr Bartholomew says the job does not feel repetitive as the company has \"lots of difference customers, so no day is the same\". The company handles 140,000 products from cosmetics to loose tea for companies which do not have their own distribution network. Marina Homica is one of those who works in the warehouse having previously worked picking fruit and vegetables. She says her current job is better as before she could not work if the weather was too bad. \"I like this job, I enjoy this job, and I like picking and packing,\" she says.

            "content": "Google has reportedly told US employees that those who fail to comply with company vaccine policies will ultimately lose their jobs. An internal memo, obtained by CNBC, told staff that they must upload documents proving vaccination status. Those who did not would be placed on unpaid leave and later sacked, it said. Google has been pushing for an eventual return to the office - which has been repeatedly delayed - and expects those attending buildings to be vaccinated. When contacted by the BBC, Google did not deny the accuracy of the US news channel's report on the leaked internal memo. A spokesperson said: \"As we've stated before, our vaccination requirements are one of the most important ways we can keep our workforce safe and keep our services running. \"We're committed to doing everything possible to help our employees who can get vaccinated do so, and firmly stand behind our vaccination policy.\" CNBC's report said the memo, sent earlier this year, told employees they had until 3 December to send Google proof of vaccination or to apply for an exemption on medical or religious grounds. What are the new working from home rules?\nHome working best way to curb Covid - scientists\nWorking from home 'costs London £2.3bn' Those who did not do so by 18 January next year would be put on \"paid administrative leave\" for 30 days, the memo said, followed by unpaid leave for up to six months. After that period of \"unpaid personal leave\" they would lose their jobs. The approach to office working is mixed among the tech giants, and complicated by US regulation and a quickly-changing scenario. The US Occupational Safety and Health Administration has told all employers with 100 or more staff that they must make sure each of their workers is either vaccinated or tested for Covid-19 once a week - a move that Google has indicated would cover almost all roles at the company. That was due to come into effect on 4 January, but was quickly challenged in court, and has been suspended pending a court ruling. However, Google said in July that anyone working in the office should be vaccinated, not just tested. Those who have - or are able to find - a 100% remote-working role are not affected by the rule. But it has also said that it expects most employees to be in the office for at least three days a week, rather than continuing to work from home. It has also said it will cut pay for US employees who continue to work remotely. Other tech firms have taken a different approach. In May, Twitter said staff could work from home \"for ever\" - with some caveats about suitable roles. The following month, Facebook followed suit, saying employees could request to continue to work from home after Covid rules were lifted. Microsoft has also made remote work a permanent option. Apple, like Google, has said it expects employees to be in the office at least three days a week - a move that resulted in strong resistance from some employees. ",

            "header": "Bank branches: Rival banks join forces to protect future of cash",
            "content": "More shared banking hubs will open in UK towns and villages as banks continue to close a swathe of branches. Major banks have signed a new voluntary agreement which means an independent assessment of local needs will be carried out each time a branch is shut. These reviews could recommend a shared branch is opened, an ATM installed or a Post Office upgraded. Banks will commit to deliver whatever is recommended. This should ensure vulnerable customers and businesses have access to cash. An estimated five million people still rely on cash, and basic banking services are considered key to the survival of notes and coins. For example, small businesses unable to deposit their takings nearby may choose to only accept card, rather than cash, payments. Cash access as vital as running water, says Age UK\nShops step in to supply cash as ATMs close Each time a core banking service such as a cash machine or bank branch is closed, an assessment will be carried out by Link - the organisation which currently oversees the UK's ATM network. The review will study the cash needs of the community, such as how easy it is to travel to the nearest alternative service, as well as the demographics and vulnerability of local residents. The criteria are set by a group of banks and consumer representatives. Assessment trials over the past year will lead to 11 new ATMs, improved cash services in 30 Post Offices, and five new shared banking hubs all opening in early 2022. At these hubs, run by the Post Office, customers of any bank can access their accounts, deposit cash and cheques, and withdraw money at any time. Trickier enquiries are dealt with by a representative from one of each of the major banks who each visit once a week. The BBC visited a prototype shared banking hub in Rochford, Essex, earlier this year and was told it had been \"a lifeline\" for many people living in the area. Running costs are the same as a small branch, but are shared between different banking groups that use it. The new shared bank branches are expected to open in Acton in London, Syston in Leicestershire, Knaresborough in North Yorkshire, Carnoustie in Angus, and Brixham in Devon. They have seen their last banks close and customers tend to have difficult journeys to reach the nearest branch services. Picturesque Brixham is a thriving fishing port popular with tourists, but when Lloyds closed in September it lost the last bank branch in town. A third of residents are over 65 and often need to travel for basic banking services as the local post office can struggle to cope with demand. Local businesses must also travel or queue for their banking needs, so many are welcoming the plan for a new shared hub. Debbie Fisher, the owner of the Buccaneer Boutique women's clothing store in Brixham, said she still received cheques from some of her customers and liked to accept cash payments too. \"Not having a branch is inconvenient as I have to go [to another town] before I open up the shop,\" she said. \"It would be fantastic to have a hub. \"It is desperately needed to keep the town together.\" From the summer of 2022 any community that has already lost its banking services can request an assessment by Link. While shared hubs may be welcomed in these local communities, the plan for five hubs and the promise of more to come will be dwarfed by the scale of bank branch closures across the UK. More than 4,000 branches have closed since the start of 2015, and another 220 are already scheduled to close next year. Consumer group Which? has called for an immediate halt to more closures, to allow the new plans and legislation to be introduced. \"The alarming acceleration of bank branch closures has left many people who depend on them for essential banking services at risk of being cut adrift, which seems to fly in the face of work being done across the industry to protect access to cash,\" said Which? chief executive Anabel Hoult. Natalie Ceeney, who chairs the Access to Cash Action Group, which drew up the plans, said concentrating solely on keeping branches open was \"missing the point\", as they only served a small section of the community who were customers of that particular bank. \"Bank branches are closing at a high rate. The alternative [to these plans] is nothing. [Under this new agreement] if there is a gap left by a bank branch closure, it will be filled,\" she told the BBC. \"Banks will continue to make their own commercial decisions. We have been making sure no community is left behind.\" She said that voluntary agreement would be made a legal requirement with legislation brought by government in the next 18 months. Martin McTague, from the Federation of Small Businesses, said: \"This new strategy will bring hope to communities which are losing bank branches and ATMs. \"It is important that the new assessments of need outlined today are independent and fair - we will be watching their progress closely.\" The pandemic has cut cash use by 35%, but millions of people - often vulnerable - still rely on notes and coins. Another system which trials showed to be successful in certain venues was cashback from shop tills, without the need to make a purchase. During trials, half of withdrawals were for less than £20 and four in 10 were for non-round amounts - suggesting people were taking out relatively small amounts available in their bank accounts. Cash machines are not set up to provide such a bespoke service. Some 2,000 shops are expected to offer the service by the end of the year. ",

            "content": "Energy companies will face more robust financial checks from January after a host of companies failed owing to a wholesale price surge, the regulator Ofgem has announced. Bosses of firms will also undergo more stringent vetting. More than 20, mostly small, suppliers have collapsed following a spike in wholesale gas prices. Nearly four million other households have seen their supplier fail since the start of the pandemic. The regulator also said it was consulting on the future set up of the energy price cap, designed to protect customers who have not switched. It has been highlighted as part of the problem by some failed companies. Failed energy firms will hike bills - power boss\nWrapping up to stay warm as energy bills rise \"I am setting out clear action so that we have robust stress testing for suppliers so they can't pass inappropriate risk to consumers,\" said Ofgem chief executive Jonathan Brearley. \"Our priority has been, and will always be, to act in the best interests of energy consumers. The months ahead will be difficult for many, and we are working with the government and energy companies to mitigate the impact as much as we can, particularly for the most vulnerable households.\" A significant rise in bills for 15 million people is inevitable in April, but Ofgem is also consulting on possible changes to the way tariffs are offered in the longer-term. Options include customers being tied in to a standard tariff for six months, like a fixed term mortgage. If they left early for a cheaper deal, they would be charged an exit fee, unlike now. The argument is that suppliers and remaining customers would not be left picking up the cost of their departure, although exit fees would be controversial. Other suggestions include forcing companies to offer the same price to existing customers as they do to new customers. A similar rule is being introduced for home and motor insurance in January. There might also be a charge paid by a supplier each time it takes on a new customer. The price cap may also be reviewed every three months, rather than the current six, or an interim price cap introduced if market conditions changed dramatically. When a host of energy companies collapsed, Ofgem was heavily criticised for having been asleep at the wheel, and unprepared for such a crisis. Citizens Advice, the official advocate for energy customers, recently published what it described as Ofgem's \"catalogue of errors\" in recent years, that was now ultimately leaving customers having to pick up a multi-million pound bill. That included an accusation that poor practice was rife, with many companies showing clear evidence of financial unsustainability, \"including firms run out of the owners' living rooms and kitchens\". These latest announcement by Ofgem will address some of those concerns. They include: If financial stress tests show up a weakness in a company, then an improvement plan will be drawn up with the regulator\nSuppliers will have to self-assess their management\nThe regulator's assessment period before granting a new licence to operate will be extended to nine months The regulator is also consulting on whether to block firms from taking on new customers once they hit certain milestones - such as 50,000 and 200,000 accounts - until it is happy with their balance sheet strength. \"What we want to say to suppliers is either get some insurance, buy your energy ahead or have enough money in the bank to weather a storm like this,\" Mr Brearley told BBC Radio 4's Today programme. Customers of collapsed firms now have to pay more for their energy, because their original tariff was not protected. Those on the price cap also saw prices rises in October. This has been a major factor in the rising cost of living, with inflation now rising at its fastest rate for a decade. Mr Brearley said that customers should brace themselves for a further significant rise in gas prices in April, when a new price cap is introduced. \"Where you have legitimate price increases and the increase in gas is legitimate then those costs need to be passed onto customers. I know that's really hard, but we do expect a significant rise in April,\" he said. He added that it was too early to give a figure and refuted that Ofgem had failed to take control of the market. \"Our job as a regulator is to make sure people pay a fair price for energy but no more than that,\" he said. Ofgem said the cap had saved consumers an estimated £1bn a year since its introduction. However it said the current methodology, while protecting consumers from price spikes, exposed suppliers to risks that are harder to manage at times of high energy price volatility. \"There is a risk that, if not tackled, this could lead to higher costs for consumers,\" the regulator said.

            "content": "Electronics retailer Currys has warned of weakening trading in the run-up to Christmas as the Omicron variant of Covid hits demand. But the firm said it was \"riding out\" the challenges, while the technology market was now \"sustainably larger\" than it was before the pandemic. \"We may face into further headwinds from Omicron and associated restrictions,\" Currys said. However, it remained \"on track\" to meet expectations of higher profits. Currys is the latest firm to warn of the impact of the new Covid variant, with signs that consumers are moderating their behaviour in response to the threat by going out less. Those who can work from home are now urged by the government to do so, while face coverings are a legal requirement in most public indoor areas. Currys' comments came as the store chain unveiled a 20% rise in adjusted pre-tax profit to £48m in the six months to 30 October. It said it expected full-year profits of about £160m, up from £156m in 2020-21. The retailer, which recently changed its name from Dixons Carphone, said it had coped well with global supply chain problems, although it had seen some impact on availability and sales of some in-demand products. \"For example, in large-screen TVs, our customers might have to do with a choice of 100 models, rather than the 120 that we would prefer to put in front of them,\" chief executive Alex Baldock told reporters. \"We're calling this out as a challenge, but we're also calling this out as a challenge that we're riding out.\" Mr Baldock said market demand would have its short-term ups and downs, but the \"big picture\" was of \"a technology market sustainably larger post-pandemic\". \"Hybrid working will become normal and in-home entertainment will continue to grow,\" he added. \"More time at home means more usage, and more customers' eyes have been opened to what new technology can do, both of which point to faster replacement.\" ",

            "content": "Seven cryptocurrency adverts have been banned by the UK's advertising watchdog. The Advertising Standards Authority (ASA) says monitoring cryptoassets, like Bitcoin, is a \"red-alert priority\" following concerns that many ads fail to fully convey the risks of investing. The banned ads included a promotion by a pizza chain and Facebook ads for a large cryptocurrency exchange. The ASA says it hopes to produce new guidance on cryptocurrency advertising. All seven ads or promotions were \"banned for irresponsibly taking advantage of consumers' inexperience and for failing to illustrate the risk of the investment\", it said. The companies whose ads were found to have broken the rules were: Coinburp: A Twitter page for Coinburp, a cryptocurrency trading platform.\neToro (UK): A paid-for display ad for eToro, a stocks and cryptocurrency trading platform.\nPayward: A digital poster for Kraken, an online cryptocurrency exchange.\nExmo Exchange: A YouTube video promoting cryptocurrency exchange Exmo\nLuno Money: An in-app ad for Luno, a cryptocurrency exchange service.\nCoinbase Europe: A paid-for Facebook ad for Coinbase, a cryptocurrency exchange platform.\nPapa John's GB: A promotion on the Papa John's pizza restaurant chain's website and in a Twitter post. The banned Papa John's website promotion offered consumers \"free Bitcoin worth £10\", as well as telling customers: \"Save £15 when you spend £30 or more & get £10 worth of Bitcoin from Luno!\" The firm said it was part of their annual celebration of \"Bitcoin pizza day\", which is said to mark the trading of two Papa John's pizzas for 10,000 bitcoins in May 2010. Ten thousand bitcoins would today be worth more than £350m ($462m). The company argued that the promotion did not make any comment on cryptocurrency or its suitability for investment. The chain said the \"free\" Bitcoin offer was entirely different from a scenario where a consumer was given the opportunity to invest their own money in a financial product. But the ASA found the offer \"trivialised what was a serious and potentially costly financial decision, especially in the context of the intended audience who were likely to have limited knowledge of cryptocurrency\". The ad for Kraken, which led to a complaint to the ASA, was seen at London Bridge station on a digital poster. Although it contained a lengthy disclaimer, the ASA considered that \"consumers would not have had the time to comprehend the relevant information in the disclaimer, if seen at all, and that it therefore was not clear\". The decision comes as some politicians question whether any cryptocurrency adverts should run on London's trains and buses. In November, the ASA announced that it was investigating adverts that appeared on the underground for cryptocurrency Floki Inu - a so-called \"meme coin\" named after billionaire Elon Musk's dog. That investigation continues, the ASA says, although Floki Inu insists that their adverts abide by the rules. The bans form part of a broader project that will result in updated guidance for the advertising of cryptoassets next year. Miles Lockwood, the watchdog's director of complaints and investigations, said: \"Cryptoassets are a red-alert priority issue for us. \"Consumers need to know about the risks of investing in cryptoassets and companies should make sure that their ads aren't misleading or socially irresponsible by taking advantage of consumers' lack of awareness around these complex and volatile products,\" he said. The ASA said it would continue to review cryptoasset ads over the next few months, not just for cryptocurrencies but also for NFTs and fan tokens. ",

The 50-seater Indian Streatery in Birmingham said more than 200 bookings had been cancelled since 'Plan B' restrictions were introduced last week. This accounts for about 80% of its festive reservations, with general manager Dhiraj Sharma saying the uncertainty was \"really difficult\". He said the hospitality industry needed more support from government. \"It's not on the customers, everyone's been so lovely about it, they've been so apologetic,\" Mr Sharma said. \"Safety is the most important thing but our running costs are still there.\" To cope, the restaurant is having to cut back on staff hours which Mr Sharma said was \"the biggest shame for us\" in the run-up to Christmas, \"but it's the only thing we can do\". Home working impacts city centre businesses\n'Non-stop cancellations' after Christmas party plea\n'We may not survive the Plan B restrictions' The government introduced 'Plan B' measures, which included urging people to work from home where possible and wear face coverings in crowded settings, last week. The guidance was in response to the spread of the Omicron variant, which currently accounts for about 20% of coronavirus cases in England. Although when they were announced, there was no specific guidance for pubs and restaurants, businesses say it has affected their customers' confidence and footfall in the city centre. In Birmingham's China Town, James Wong who runs Chung Ying restaurant, said the cancellations were \"depressing\". \"Seventy per cent of our bookings have been cancelled,\" he said. \"It's looking pretty bleak at this time.\" \"Every restaurant is banking on a good Christmas... we just don't know what's going to happen.\" Mr Sharma said his business is now planning \"day by day\" due to the uncertainty. \"A lot of people just don't know what to do,\" he said.

            "header": "BT: Billionaire Patrick Drahi raises stake to 18%",
            "content": "Billionaire Patrick Drahi has raised his investment in BT amid growing speculation that the telecoms giant could face a takeover bid. The Israeli-French businessman took his stake from 12% to 18%, prompting an immediate government response that it would intervene if necessary. His company, Altice, said it had no plans to make a full bid, but that could change if circumstances do. Mr Drahi stake-building in BT sparked rumours about other possible bidders. The businessman, who also owns auction house Sotheby's, first began buying BT shares in June. Altice said in a statement: \"Over recent months we have engaged constructively with the board and management of BT and look forward to continuing that dialogue. \"We continue to hold them in high regard and remain fully supportive of their strategy, principally to play the pivotal role in delivering the expansion of access to a full fibre broadband network - an investment programme which is so important to both BT and to the UK.\" However, his move prompted the government to warn it could intervene if required, with ministers concerned that any pressure on BT to cut costs could affect the ongoing broadband rollout. A spokesman said: \"The government notes the latest acquisition of BT shares by Altice. We are monitoring the situation carefully. \"The government is committed to levelling up the country through digital infrastructure, and will not hesitate to act if required to protect our critical national telecoms infrastructure.\" What is French billionaire Patrick Drahi up to? His purchase of just over 12% of BT six months ago made him the largest shareholder, just ahead of Deutsche Telekom (DT), which owns 12%. Mr Drahi now has 18% - 12% short of 30% - at which point the takeover rules would force him to make an offer for the whole company. Sources close to Mr Drahi insist it is a coincidence that is the exact size of the DT stake. The government has made it very clear that it would \"not hesitate to act if required to protect our critical national infrastructure\". Tougher rules to prevent foreign takeovers of key assets come into force in January next year, but it could block a takeover under the current rules. So what's Mr Drahi's game? Sources say Mr Drahi recognises three things. Firstly, BT is in a strong market position with a government backing its big digital infrastructure investment plans. Secondly, the current shareholder structure is unstable. Deutsche Telekom have had their stake parked in their employee pension fund for nearly a decade and the DT boss has said recently he exepects \"something to happen\" in the next 12 months. Third, when something happens, Mr Drahi would like to have a seat at the table. I understand that Mr Drahi has not asked for a boardroom position yet. For now, he is happy to sit with a large chunk of a company he thinks is undervalued. Takeover rules mean he has wait a further six months anyway. But at some point, something's got to give. And when it does, Mr Drahi plans to be - in investment banking basketball patter - \"around the hoop\". BT said it noted the purchase, adding that it would \"continue to operate the business in the interest of all shareholders and remains focused on the successful execution of its strategy and building on recent performance momentum\". Altice said \"it does not intend to make an offer for BT\". Under British takeover rules, that bars Mr Drahi from making such a move for six months. Mr Drahi announced in June that he had bought a 12.1% stake in BT, worth £2.2bn at the time. Born in Morocco to a Jewish family in 1963\nFrench, Israeli and Portuguese citizenship\nLives in Switzerland\nFounded Altice, now France's second-largest telecoms group\nOwns Sotheby's, and assets in France, the US, Portugal and Israel\nWorth $7.6bn (£5.7bn), and is one of the world's top 200 billionaires, according to Forbes After the Brexit referendum, the pound slumped against the dollar and the euro, and it is still below 2016 levels. This gives foreign firms interested in getting hold of UK firms more buying power than prior to Brexit. In addition, UK shares \"remain cheap because of the perceived significant political and economic risks of Brexit, which continue to linger and depress the valuation of the UK stock market,\" Sue Noffke, head of UK equities at Schroders said in November. She added that the \"valuation discount is completely unwarranted\", but \"as a result UK-listed companies continue to be picked off by overseas private equity buyers\" and \"overseas industry peers\". UK companies 'perform better' with overseas owners\nGigabit broadband: Internet seen as top homebuyer priority Due to low interest rates, debt is very cheap, and before Omicron concerns surfaced, investors were also cheered by a global economic recovery from the Covid pandemic. In the first seven months of 2021, UK takeovers hit a 14-year high. Shares in BT fell 7% in morning trading in London, and over the past five years its shares have more than halved in value after low growth. The 175-year-old company is in the middle of a transformational programme to build a £15bn national broadband fibre network, a strategy crucial both to the company and the government, which says it wants to boost regional growth. Online shopping and home working using the internet have increased in importance due to the pandemic, all of which make BT a tempting takeover target. While British governments have in the past welcomed foreign investment and takeovers, any full bid for BT would put ministers in a difficult position due to the company's role in protecting national security. Any bidder for BT would also have to face competition scrutiny. ",

            "header": "Post Office scandal: Government to foot bill for postmasters' compensation",
            "content": "The government has agreed to foot the bill for the compensation of former Post Office workers who were falsely convicted of theft in the long-running Horizon saga. The Post Office has said it is unable to cover the payments for the exonerated individuals. As the Post Office's only shareholder, the government has confirmed in a statement that it will pay. So far, 72 postmasters' convictions have been quashed. Several other cases are in progress, and there are potentially hundreds more postmasters whose convictions relied on Horizon evidence who may seek to have their convictions overturned. Postal Affairs Minister Paul Scully said: \"We want to see these postmasters with quashed convictions compensated fairly and swiftly. \"I am pleased to confirm that today the government is making funding available to facilitate Post Office to make final compensation payments to postmasters whose convictions have been overturned. \"By providing this funding, government is helping Post Office deliver the fair compensation postmasters deserve.\" Discussions about final settlement figures with the individuals involved will now take place. The government has not provided any details about whether it has set aside a specific amount of money. Darren Jones, who chairs the Commons Business Committee, said it was \"wholly unacceptable\" for a minister to give a written statement without sufficient detail only two hours before the committee's own hearing on the issue began. Post Office scandal: 'It's been a strange 15 years'\nWhy were hundreds of sub-postmasters prosecuted?\nPostmasters in IT scandal to get up to £100,000 Between 2000 and 2014, the Post Office prosecuted 736 sub-postmasters and sub-postmistresses - an average of one a week - based on information from a recently-installed computer system called Horizon. Some went to prison following convictions for false accounting and theft, many were financially ruined and have described being shunned by their communities. But it was the software at fault, containing \"bugs, errors and defects\" according to the High Court judgement which quashed many of the convictions. Some died before campaigners won the legal battle to have their cases reconsidered. The government's bill keeps growing as more elements of this scandal emerge. Despite having spent millions on their own legal costs pursuing sub-postmasters through the courts, the Post Office has essentially said it can't afford to pay for any of the clear-up. As the sole shareholder, it's up to the government to settle up. They had already agreed to pay the costs of the scheme that refunds the money that branch managers put in to cover the holes that the IT was incorrectly showing. That bill will run into the millions and cash advances are now being paid to some of those people. Now the government has agreed to fund whatever financial settlements are reached with those who were wrongly convicted in court. Money can never cover the loss of livelihoods, family relationships and the loss of freedom for some of those convicted, but it's likely some will see settlements worth multimillions. After decades of overlooking reports of problems at the Post Office, the government is now having to use the deep-pockets of the taxpayer to make amends. The Post Office welcomed the financial backing being provided by the government. \"Whilst we cannot change the past, it is right that meaningful compensation is provided to victims of the Horizon scandal as fast as possible,\" said its chief executive Nick Read. \"Many former postmasters have waited a long time for justice and Post Office welcomes the government's announcement that funding is being made available for compensation that recognises the impact on the lives of those affected.\" A scheme, backed by the government, had already been set up to arrange financial redress and compensation for those affected. The \"vast majority\" of postmasters who have had their convictions quashed have each received an interim compensation payment of up to £100,000, Mr Scully said. One of those to have received an interim payment is Jo Hamilton. She was accused by the Post Office of taking £36,000 from the village shop she ran in Hampshire. Her conviction was eventually quashed. On Tuesday, she told the Business Committee about the financial impact that the saga had on her life. \"When I had discrepancies they kept back my wages twice - I'd ring up and ask how much the shortfall was and they'd say: 'Well, you have to pay it',\" she told MPs. \"They just kept my wages until it was paid off and then the amounts grew and grew. \"I re-mortgaged and put £9,000 in, I borrowed money from friends, my parents helped out and then, ultimately, I ended up in Winchester Crown Court and had to plead guilty to false accounting.\" Another former sub-postmaster - Noel Thomas, from Anglesey - said the compensation would not make up for the time he spent in prison. In 2006, he was wrongly jailed for nine months for false accounting after £48,000 apparently went missing from office accounts. \"I didn't have the money, I lost about £30,000 for my post office wage and about £15,000 for my county council job,\" the 74-year-old said. \"It was a big blow, everything went overnight.\" He said he was originally told he was the only one involved in the scandal, but he suddenly realised over a cup of tea with the other 35 sub-postmasters that he was not alone. \"It's been a long fight. The first four years were very hard, I was on my knees but thanks to family and good friends and colleagues, gradually we got there.\" ",

            "content": "The number of people in part-time work jumped in the three months to October, after falling sharply in the pandemic, official figures show. There was also a fall in unemployment among 16-24 year-olds, another group hit hard by the crisis. It comes unemployment continues to fall after a spike last year, with job vacancies now at a fresh record high. But the figures predate the arrival of the Omicron variant which some fear may lead to restrictions in some sectors. The overall unemployment rate fell to 4.2% between August and September, the Office for National Statistics (ONS) said. \"With still no sign of the end of the furlough scheme hitting the number of jobs, the total of employees on payroll continued to grow strongly in November,\" said head of economic statistics Darren Morgan. \"Separately, survey findings show much of the recent growth in employment has been among part-timers, who were particularly hard hit at the start of the pandemic.\" As businesses struggled with successive lockdowns, the number of people working part-time fell sharply to 7.7 million in the March to May period this year. However, as employers expanded again, this number has risen to 8.07 million in the three months to October, driving the latest quarterly increase in employment. Younger, less experienced workers have also struggled to find work during the crisis. But the ONS said the unemployment rate among 16-24 year-olds had now recovered to pre-pandemic levels at 11.3% - down from a high of 14.8% in the July to September period of last year. Job vacancies have continued to rise over the past six months as the economy reopens and employers race to hire staff. Between September and November, they hit a fresh record of 1.22 million - some 434,500 higher than before the pandemic. However, the ONS said the rate of growth was slowing. Rob Clarry, an economist at PwC UK, said there were \"tentative signs\" that demand for labour could be reaching its peak. The end of the job support scheme in October has not led to a significant rise in unemployment, the ONS said, looking at the quarter as whole. UK employers added 257,000 staff to their payrolls in November - taking the total number above pre-pandemic levels. But on a monthly basis, there was a slight increase in the unemployment rate between October and November - from 4% to 4.3%. And the ONS cautioned that some workers who have recently been made redundant may still be working out their notice. Mr Clarry said it remained too early to judge the impact of Omicron on the labour market. But he added: \"We expect it to hit consumer demand for contact-intensive sectors, such as food and hospitality, over the near term. This could reduce demand for labour in these sectors over the coming months.\" However, the chairman of Reed Employment, James Reed, said: \"There's been plenty of talk from doomsayers that the Omicron variant will plunge us back into economic despair, but the outlook appears much more optimistic now compared with the first Covid wave we faced in March 2020. \"It's currently the best time in 50 years to look for a new job.\" Commenting on the latest jobs figures, Chancellor Rishi Sunak said: \"The jobs outlook remains strong thanks to our £400bn economic support package, Plan for Jobs and fantastic vaccine programme. \"To keep safeguarding our economic recovery and the lives and livelihoods of the British people, I am now calling on everyone to keep playing their part and get boosted now.\" In broad terms the jobs numbers continued to reflect an encouraging recovery from the traumatic impact of the lockdowns, with payroll levels higher and redundancy levels lower than before the pandemic. However, there was a modest impact from the end of the furlough scheme. On the monthly measure, unemployment in October, the first full month after the end of the Coronavirus Job Retention Scheme, was up to 4.3% from 4.0% the month before. That represents an increase of 77,500. The full impact of the removal of furlough will take a few more months to filter into redundancy figures, given notice periods. The weekly measures suggest October's rise was the result of an initial spike in the first week of the month which settled down later. Vacancies continue to set new records, but this is holding back the underlying economic recovery. There is a post-Brexit factor here, but also a number of older workers who have retired during the pandemic and a lack of students doing part-time work. The impact of this ongoing jobs squeeze on annual wage settlements is the next unknown to watch for, after Omicron. The latest jobs figures come in the week that the Bank of England's Monetary Policy Committee (MPC) decides on whether to raise its key interest rate from the current historic low of 0.1%. It is under pressure to address fast-rising inflation, but wants to be sure that the expiry of the furlough scheme at the end of September did not cause a jump in unemployment before any decision to raise rates for the first time since the pandemic. But the fast spread of Omicron has raised fears of a new economic slowdown and prompted investors to bet against a rate rise as soon as Thursday. \"The combination of a tight labour market and low unemployment evident in today's data could on their own be sufficient to merit a rate rise,\" said KPMG's UK chief economist Yael Selfin. \"Nonetheless, with the emergence of the Omicron variant over the recent weeks, we now expect the MPC to unanimously hold off raising rates until next year.\" ",

How to find a job in Wales in a pandemic\nCovid has 'accelerated' industrial automation The labour market in Wales is healthy, with more people in work than before the pandemic began. There is no clear impact on unemployment following the end of furlough in September, although some staff who were laid off may still be working their notice period. It will take a few months for the true impact of furlough's end to work its way into the statistics. But while there are high levels of employment, those who are in work will feel like their pay packets are shrinking. Inflation is forecast to continue to rise until May next year, making the cost of living more expensive for everyone - whether they are in work or not. ",

Purecraft Bar & Kitchen in the city centre said it was seeing up to about 30% cancellations. Caterers at The Colmore Building, an office block accommodating 3,000 people, currently see about 800 people. People in England should start working at home again if they can, the government said, under plans to tackle the spread of the Omicron variant. Some venues and events will be legally required to check the Covid status of visitors over 18 from Wednesday, if approved by MPs. Paul Brazier, from Purecraft, said it was reliant on people working in the business district. He added: \"It's gonna impact us considerably, people working from home. We've seen that previous when the government made those decisions last time and we're gonna see that again. \"It's heavily impacting on our business and we're seeing up to about 30% cancellations of our bookings now.\" Caterer Lee Thomas from The Colmore Building said: \"Throughout the whole of lockdown we've been in and out kind of three or four times and we've built it back up again, so as of January we'll start again and do it again.\" Michelle Dalton, from Rockfine Group Ltd, heads up a firm of management consultants helping businesses who are looking to find new revenue streams. She stated the government was \"giving us the flexibility to make the best decision for our team and for our business\" and the company would have a work-from-home arrangement from Tuesday. Ms Dalton said while home working reduces virus transmission \"we also have to balance that with the wellbeing of our employees... and then the needs of the business to have team working together, sharing ideas effectively\". Rockfine Group project executive Georgia Greenburgh is prepared to do what it takes to avoid another a lockdown. She said: \"[This] time we will hopefully have some kind of like social interaction, it's not just like being trapped in your house again, so yeah not much resentment. \"I like understand that we have to do [it]. It's just frustrating more than anything, it's just like constantly stopping and starting in what's meant to be like [an] exciting time of your life.\" Follow BBC West Midlands on Facebook, Twitter and Instagram.

            "header": "Working from home: 'We get more done in the office'",
            "content": "The boss of a City firm says he is unhappy about new work-from-home guidance as his staff will get less done when they're not in the office. Employees in England should work remotely if they can from Monday. Road traffic and footfall on public transport fell sharply on Monday compared to a week ago, data shows. Andrew Monk of VSA Capital called the rules frustrating and inconsistent. But some workers said they now felt safer as the Omicron variant spread. The new advice brings England in line with Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland. Some 37% of working UK adults worked from home in 2020, suggesting many frontline employees will be unaffected by the guidance. Mr Monk, who employs 20 staff in London, said he had spent \"a lot of time\" making sure his office was safe and all of his staff had come back. He said most were happier to be in, because it was \"good for their lives, but also good for the business as well\". \"This is a very live industry, you need a lot of interaction, bouncing ideas around, meeting people,\" he told the BBC's Today programme. \"We have quite clear proof that where we do fundraisings, for instance, and we do one-on-one meetings with clients, we raise far more money than when it is done on a Zoom call.\" Firms warn of 'devastating' impact of new rules He also criticised the fact that the government was allowing people to continue socialising over the festive period and hold Christmas parties. \"This time last year, we were being told, go to work but don't party, but now we're being told, party but don't go to work. It just doesn't make sense.\" There was a 20% drop in footfall at railway stations managed by Network Rail on Monday morning compared with a week ago. Its locations include major terminus stations in London, Birmingham and Manchester. Meanwhile, passenger numbers on London Underground fell by 18% compared with last week. Figures from location technology firm TomTom show cities across England experienced a decline in road traffic early Monday. In London at 8am, congestion levels were down from 72% two weeks ago to 60%. In Birmingham it dropped from 87% to 55%, Bristol from 60% to 41%, and Leeds from 74% to 43%. Joseff Saunders is a coastal scientist at Plymouth's Coastal Observatory and works in a team of eight. He said working from home made simple tasks more difficult and it was harder to get support from teammates. \"I just feel like there's a bit of a loss of team working,\" he told the BBC. \"It's really easy these days to turn on Zoom to have a meeting, but you lose a bit of granularity when you head down that route.\" Businesses that rely on commuters, such as cafés and pubs, have also criticised the rules, which they say will result in a huge drop in passing trade. Electronics firm Dyson, for example, has also asked some of its IT and research staff to come into the office. In a statement, the firm said some of its workers still needed to commute for \"practical, confidentiality and security reasons\". Meanwhile, the Confederation of British Industry (CBI) has warned ministers against \"a lockdown mentality\". CBI director-general Tony Danker said the working from home guidance should be lifted \"as soon as it is safe to do so\". \"The economy should remain as open as is feasibly safe to do so in the coming weeks,\" he said. \"The bar should be high when it comes to any new restrictions on economic activity beyond Plan B.\" However, other firms successfully adopted hybrid working models before the latest guidance came in. And some workers say they feel happier, more productive and safer working remotely as Covid spreads. Jenny Watts, who works in financial services in Bradley Stoke, said: \"I definitely feel safer working from home and not commuting. \"People close the bus windows as it's cold, there isn't proper social spacing and many don't wear masks.\" Ms Watts also explained working from home gave her a better work-life balance, despite some of the hurdles. \"I get to see my family more and don't have to waste hours commuting.\" Phil Foster, chief executive at Love Energy Savings, an energy retailer based in Bolton, told the BBC that most employees preferred to work at home. \"We've been ready for this for a long time and have a good rhythm for working easily from home. \"Staff have been able to handle this really smoothly and it's comforting for me to know the staff are safe and can hopefully have a normal Christmas.\" According to a recent survey of the firm's 290 staff, 60% said they wanted home working to stay, while 100% wanted the option to work from the office and home. Some have warned that working from home can impact mental health. But Lynne Ingram, managing associate at the law firm Freeths, said: \"You hear people say they are more productive in the office, but you also see employees saying they are working longer hours because they are working from home. \"Obviously there are a lot of mental health issues with regard to that.\" Those still expected to come into work have a right to raise their concerns if they feel their workplace isn't safe, or if they are concerned about their commute, Ms Ingram said. \"Long before Covid, there's always been a [legal] duty to provide a safe place of work. \"Everybody has particular health concerns or family issues, and some people have a longer commute and are worried about public transport.\" Some employers have been refreshing their health and safety standards to make sure their workplaces are as safe as possible, she said. Even if employees are working from home, their employer has an obligation to ensure they are working safely, she added. That might mean checking when they are logging on and off to make sure they are not overworking, as well as ensuring they had taken their rest breaks. ",

            "content": "A flaw in widely used computer code is prompting 100 new hacking attempts every minute, a security company says. Check Point said it had seen attempts to exploit the vulnerability on over 40% of corporate networks globally. One US official said the security flaw, Log4shell, posed a \"severe risk\", with companies warning it was being actively used by criminal groups. Fixes have been issued but need to be implemented. Popular applications and cloud services have been affected. Written in the programming language Java, Log4J, the code containing the flaw, is used by millions of computers running online services. In the last four months it had been downloaded 84 million times from the largest public repository of open-source Java components, Brian Fox of security company Sonatype, said. And the ease with which hackers could exploit the vulnerability was, \"akin to someone figuring out that mailing a letter into your postbox, with a specific address written on it, allows them to open all your doors in your house\". Words such as \"critical\" and \"emergency\" are often bandied around by cyber-security people when a major flaw is discovered. But in this crisis, another word has stuck out - \"trivial\". According to Crowdstrike, the weakness everyone is trying to fix is \"trivial\" to exploit. Often when a vulnerability is found in a computer system, there is a little bit of time to fix it. The cyber-criminals have to work out a way to attack and usually only the smartest crews can do so in the first few hours. But in this case, it is, apparently, very easy. We do not yet know how many of these attempted attacks are successful - but this incident has the potential to be extremely costly for corporations that become victims. For the average person, there is not a lot we can do. Make sure your apps and software are up to date - and send thoughts, prayers and hugs to the IT teams around the world trying to fix this problem. Researchers at Chinese technology company Alibaba discovered the flaw last month. But it gained widespread public attention after being found affecting some sites hosting versions of Minecraft using Java. Before the flaw was made public, the Apache Software Foundation, which oversees the Log4j code, issued a fix for the problem, rating the problem a \"10\" - the highest level of seriousness. Cloudflare chief technology officer John Graham-Cumming said, \"This is the third really serious flaw that's affected a wide range of Internet services: Heartbleed in 2012, ShellShock in 2014 and Log4Shell in 2021\". US Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency director Jen Easterly also stressed the urgency of the situation. \"To be clear, this vulnerability poses a severe risk,\" she wrote. It was being widely exploited by hackers and \"presents an urgent challenge to network defenders given its broad use\". The UK National Cyber Security Centre said, \"This is a significant vulnerability\" and called on organisations to urgently follow advice on mitigating the problem. Microsoft researchers said they had seen hackers using Log4shell to: install malicious software that mined crypto-currency\nsteal passwords and log-ins\nextract data from compromised systems ",

            "content": "As concerns surrounding the latest Covid variant have grown in recent days, the hospitality industry is beginning to feel the impact. Last week, Prime Minister Boris Johnson announced the introduction of new Covid measures - known as Plan B - due to the threat posed by the Omicron variant. The ramping up of restrictions, together with the prime minister's declaration of an \"Omicron emergency\" on Sunday, has made many people reluctant to go out and socialise. We asked three pubs and restaurants how they are being affected. Over the weekend, the Elephant and Castle pub in Wheathampstead, Hertfordshire, had 12 separate groups cancel bookings. With party sizes ranging from 12 to 38, the owners say this has had a \"devastating effect\", not just on their business but on others in the community too. Food and drink, much of which is ordered from local suppliers, will go to waste, they say, with future orders being potentially reduced, and staff who are scheduled to work may now not be needed. Joint owner Matt Elvidge has called for those considering cancelling bookings to just \"talk to them\" to find a solution. \"Staff don't get to work shifts and can't pay their bills and cash flow is devastated,\" he says. \"There just needs to be a conversation. People don't really consider the impact of their decisions on others.\" His suggestions include arranging smaller group or team meals in separate areas or on separate dates, or rewarding your team with meal vouchers. They also own a brewery so can offer tour vouchers, boxes of beer or bottles of their gin, spiced rum or whisky. He says there is a lot of scaremongering and people tend to say, \"that's it, we're staying in\". \"But there needs to be a balance in the way people react to the situation,\" he says. \"Don't just have a knee-jerk reaction, there are ways you can show your love for your team and support the local community. \"Call us and see what we can do. If you don't, there's a very good chance we won't be here when the next festive period comes.\" The Cellar House in Norwich says while it has lost a few bookings, \"it doesn't seem as bad as it could have been painted\" - and the pub is making up ground in other areas. \"But it's still not as Christmas should be, because there's an element of caution and people are changing their habits,\" says landlady Victoria MacDonald. \"We're finding that while not everyone wants to go to a big office party, they will go out with the people they want to be with, so we might get smaller groups from offices. \"Also, people might decide not to meet up with friends but will use the money to go out with family instead. \"This year it's not about packing people in, we're still doing everything in a socially responsible way. It's just all a little bit quieter, but we're doing the best we can.\" Part of their offering includes a workstation deal for people working from home. For a set price people can come in, use the wifi, and have tea and coffee and a sandwich during a three-hour block. \"Sometimes people just don't feel comfortable working from home,\" Ms MacDonald says. \"They can't bear sitting within the same four walls, don't have a decent workspace or just want to see another face.\" \"We know how important it is to not be on your own and even if they don't want to engage, there's still a hubbub going on.\" But Ms MacDonald, who is also on the Campaign for Pubs executive committee, says there is \"more concern\" about pubs that are drink-led, often in city centres, who rely on people going out spontaneously in the run-up to Christmas. \"If people are being told to work from home, then [those pubs] will probably suffer the most because that's a lot of trade for them to lose.\" At the Rose and Crown in St Albans, Hertfordshire, they were looking forward to a packed pub last weekend with a Christmas party for 100 people. Six days before, the group, which was involved in education, cancelled amid worries over the new variant. Landlord Jamie West said: \"Understandably they started to feel uncomfortable being seen to have that big a gathering... they took the decision they had to pull the plug.\" The weekend of the party was the pub's most frequently requested for Christmas parties, but at late notice it was impossible to find new groups. That was when charities St Albans Action for Homeless and Ask for Clive stepped in and took on the booking for a fundraising evening. \"Six days notice meant all the other parties had found somewhere else to go and we were left with a gaping hole - that booking was the whole pub. \"We had a raffle, quiz, did the buffet, and they just sort of salvaged something that could have been a terrible evening at a terrible time for the hospitality industry,\" Mr West says.

            "header": "Bedford: 'We believe our town is on the up'",
            "content": "A town centre that has lost Debenhams, Marks & Spencer, Beales, Top Shop and River Island in recent years is fighting back with the opening of new businesses and the renovation of its High Street. So does this mean Bedford is on the up? Bedford prides itself on being a market town since its Royal Charter was awarded by Henry II in 1166, and runs two markets a week on Wednesday and Saturdays. But ask the council, business owners and shoppers what makes Bedford stand out compared to Milton Keynes and Rushden Lakes, the answer is often its high number of independent shops. Love Bedford, the Bedford Business Improvement District (BID), says the town is bucking the national trend and according to the National High Street Index, 64.7% of its businesses are independents - nearly double the UK average at 38.7%. There are currently about 400 independent businesses in the town, it proudly says. One of the new businesses is Mist, on Bedford High Street, that despite new national fears over coronavirus opened to full capacity last weekend. Salvatore Franco, manager of Royal Shisha which is based at the bar and grill, says he is excited about the town's future. However, the new rule for people to work from home has left him concerned that some may stay away. \"Bedford is all the way on the up, it's my hometown,\" he says. \"I've been here for 22 years and I've invested in so many other properties and stuff outside of Bedford, I thought I would jump back into Bedford and do something for the locals. Now we're bringing a new life to the town centre.\" Regarding coronavirus restrictions, he says \"everyone needs to live\" and feels reassured that his customers are staying safe. For two-and-a-half years, the former Mexico restaurant has sat empty on the town's Riverside. On Monday, Foxy Wings took its place after a successful crowdfunding campaign. Tim Edwards, its general manger and one of four co-owners, says: \"Because of Covid we got an opportunity that we wouldn't have otherwise got, because the landlords are more open to an independent unit than they would have.\" He says the town is \"on the up\". \"We can see the works on the High Street, we can see new stores opening, new restaurants opening, there's talk of more restaurants and smaller chains opening. \"If you allow the independent businesses to fill some of those gaps, I really think it will continue to go from strength to strength. \"Our towns are going to change. We have to look to the future and I think this is going to be a town with a fantastic thriving independent scene.\" Gabbie Pearson, another co-owner, says despite the new rules coming in for Plan B, people are \"still keen to come out and dine with us, as December bookings have been pouring in\". \"We are committed to being safe and making sure everyone can enjoy themselves,\" she says. \"We believe Bedford is on the up,\" says Emily Ord, marketing manager for Bedford BID. \"We're excited about what has been happening these past few months and into next year.\" The group has just wrapped the vacant Debenhams and Beales stores with new signage to give them a \"cleaner and fresher\" look. She says a number of units are purposely being kept empty to house exhibition and community space for the High Street Heritage Action Zone (HSAZ), which is an investment of £1.76m from Historic England to restore historical features on 43 buildings. \"Since the beginning of the pandemic we've seen 60-plus businesses open up in Bedford. Units are being taken over, we're losing some businesses, but they're being replaced quite quickly,\" says Emily. The independents, like the \"tiny boutiques that curate things that you can't find online\", are the \"draw\" along with services, she adds. \"You can't get your haircut online, you can't have a nice coffee online, you can't have an ice cream online. \"Bedford is the place to come in and have these great experiences. It's about shopping for things you didn't know you wanted and you are really happy with. \"It's also been reassuring to see so many people mask wearing again as they go about town - it gives me confidence in the Plan B approach.\" Recently, B&M opened in the former Marks & Spencer store on the corner of Midland Road and Harpur Street. The building has sat empty since May 2019, when the popular retailer moved out. Helen Patterson started Town Centre Champions in January 2019 to battle its closure. \"The unit has been blacked out for two-and-a-half years now, so it's exciting to see a thriving retail business opening in the former store,\" she says. \"There's still plenty of life in bricks and mortar shops. \"I walked past the store on Saturday afternoon and it was packed out with customers with smiles on their faces and arms full of shopping.\" Bedford is becoming a \"vibrant and varied town centre\", says Liberal Democrat councillor Henry Vann, who is the portfolio holder for town centres at Bedford Borough Council. \"We proactively work with our local shops, communities and residents to secure investment. This includes a reopened and significantly improved High Street environment, the HSAZ, as well as a Town Centre Priority Fund which supports local projects and improvements, and a £1m accelerator fund improving pedestrian access, events infrastructure and cycling facilities. \"This is just the start - the £22.5m won through our Town Deal Board, supported by fantastic local business leaders, is an exciting opportunity to continue to improve our local environment.\" Alannah Gray, from Marston Moretaine, normally does her shopping in Bedford. She noticed the new-look High Street that has fully reopened after it was adapted to become a single lane, with wider pavements and special loading bays. \"It works a lot better, traffic does get a little congested, but it's a lot safer for pedestrians. It's a big improvement and it doesn't look so derelict,\" she says. The selection of shops is a \"good thing\", she says, but she thinks there is still not enough. Max Corrigan is from Bedford and Lexi Powell has recently moved here, but as she works from home she mainly does her shopping online. She thinks the town is \"looking run down\". \"It's not bad, it's not great,\" she says. Max believes the changes to the High Street are \"good\" but it is still \"run down and quiet\". \"I do think it's on the up - it hit a low but now it's getting there,\" he says. He does not come into Bedford to shop, as he mostly goes to Milton Keynes, but he does like to \"hang out in escape rooms or have a coffee\". Tom Crawford lives in Cople and in the six years he has been shopping in the town \"a lot has changed\", he says. \"It could be a lot better, the council is trying,\" he says. He would like to see \"more independents\" and his habit of shopping in Bedford is not going to change, as \"I can't stand Milton Keynes, so I prefer coming here\".

            "header": "Firms warn of 'devastating' impact of new restrictions",
            "content": "Business is falling apart right now and no-one should pretend otherwise, said Vicki Wilkes, owner of live entertainment venue Red by Night in Brierley Hill, in the west Midlands. \"It's soul-destroying,\" she told the BBC. New restrictions are coming into force to tackle the Omicron variant, including increased use of Covid passes and a return to more working from home. That has prompted businesses to call for more government support. Covid passes, proving vaccination status, will also be required to get into nightclubs and large venues like Ms Wilkes' from next week, as part of the 'Plan B' rules to limit the spread of the virus. The change will be \"devastating\" for her business she said, and there had not been sufficient economic support or guidance from the government. \"No-one wants Omicron to spread but Plan B feels knee-jerk and reactionary,\" she said. Economic growth stutters before impact of Omicron\nHow will Plan B affect the economy?\nWhat are the new Covid rules across the UK? \"We were relying on December to see us through, and this loss could be the straw that break the camels back.\" She is on the verge of cancelling a family Christmas show at the under-500 capacity venue because of the new restrictions. That equated to several thousand pounds of lost revenue, she said. Her call for help has been echoed by the British Chambers of Commerce director, Shevaun Haviland, who warned that retail and hospitality businesses are the most exposed to the new measures, but are not being sufficiently supported by the government. Ms Haviland has written to the chancellor to request a return to charging a reduced 5% rate of VAT for hospitality and tourism businesses, 100% business rates relief for the retail sector, and grant funding to help the hardest hit firms. \"It is simply not good enough for the government to say at this juncture that 'enough support has been provided' and leave it at that,\" she added. Retail, events and hospitality firms had \"strained every sinew\" to get to this point, but now \"face being hamstrung during this crucial festive period through no fault of their own,\" she said. The BBC has contacted the Department for Business, Energy and Industrial Strategy for a response. Dave Critchley, executive head chef of Lu Ban restaurant in Liverpool, has suffered from a wave of cancellations since the government's announcement. \"We're back to those uncertain times, and we feel we are once again back in this terrible situation,\" he said. The restrictions have made the public worried, which will have a \"massive\" impact on the hospitality industry, Mr Critchley added. \"It's not just about the restaurants and bars, but all the staff, their mental health, their stress levels. Will there be enough hours to pay them so they can enjoy Christmas?\" Alice Cassinelli, the 25-year-old owner of Dysh café in Sheffield, has also already seen cancellations and a fall in walk-in customers. \"The drop in trade is definitely unnerving,\" she told the BBC. She opened her first cafe, Cassinellis's in Sheffield's city centre two years ago, but had to close when lockdown hit because the business lost trade as office workers left the centre of town. \"We just started to recover and that was working, but now we're in the in-between stage, which is hard as there's no support for us to keep going,\" she said. She has put social distancing measures in place to make people feel as safe as possible, but she fears the restrictions will discourage customers. The restrictions could also lead to food and drink being wasted, the Federations of Wholesale Distributors (FWD) warned. FWD Chief Executive James Bielby said: \"All across the country, warehouses are full of Christmas stock bound for the hospitality sector\". \"At such short notice, and because fresh food is time and temperature sensitive, it's just not possible for it all to be re-purposed.\" Wholesalers, he said, would be left to foot the bill for wastage costs, pointing out they had previously been excluded from both the business rates relief offered to supermarkets and the grants given to the retail, hospitality and leisure firms, which are their customers. Sir John Timpson, chairman of the shoe repair and key-cutting chain, also warned the survival of city centre businesses was being threatened by the government's work from home guidance. Sir John told the BBC that the arrival of Omicron had already led to a 5% drop in business over the last couple of weeks, and said that could easily turn into a 10% fall by the new year, when people would normally return to work after a Christmas break, but may now stay at home. \"Once we get beyond Christmas, you're going to find that city centre businesses go back to where they were at the beginning of the Covid problem in March 2020,\" he said. \"And this is going to keep happening again and again. There will be more variants,\" he said. The upshot could be that some businesses disappear for good, he added. \"The infrastructure that supports office life in central London, but also Birmingham, Glasgow, Leeds and lots of other places, will not be there to support people when they eventually go back to work.\" ",

            "header": "Drakeford: Two Covid rule reviews before Christmas",
            "content": "Wales' Covid rules could change before Christmas after the first minister announced he would review them week-by-week. Mark Drakeford has held off imposing new restrictions for the time being. But he said ministers will be monitoring the situation closely if they need to put in place \"additional protections\" in response to Omicron. The change means there will be two weekly reviews in the run-up to Christmas. The Welsh government urged individuals to take lateral flow tests before going shopping, going to Christmas parties or visiting others. It also extended guidance on mask wearing to pubs and restaurants, when people are not eating. Four more cases of Omicron were declared in Wales on Friday, bringing the total to 13, although it is thought there are more. Two vaccine doses don't stop you catching Omicron\nPeople urged to use Covid tests before going out\nDoes Wales have its own Covid Plan B? It comes as the Scottish government warned of a \"tsunami\" of Omicron cases. Mr Drakeford attended a meeting of senior leaders across the UK on Friday, at which UK Levelling Up Secretary Michael Gove said they were presented with \"very challenging new information\". He said the UK faced a \"deeply concerning situation\", with Omicron doubling every two to three days in England. Earlier, Mr Drakeford told a press conference Wales \"may be about a week behind what is happening in other parts of England and Scotland\". \"And that may give us a little bit more time here in Wales to learn and to act\". Usually the government looks at the rules once every three weeks. He said because of the speed things may change his cabinet would move from holding three-weekly reviews, to holding them once a week. Meanwhile, the Welsh Parliament has announced it will close the Senedd building and hold its proceedings virtually in response to the new variant. More than 1,200 cases of Omicron have been found in the UK, but the figure is thought to be an underestimate. Experts in the UK Health Security Agency (UKHSA) believe the variant will become dominant by mid-December. On Friday, the UKHSA said two doses of a Covid vaccine were not enough to stop someone catching Covid. However, a third booster dose significantly increased protection to around 75%. The Welsh NHS is expanding its booster programme and aims to offer a jab to all adults by the end of January. Wales' latest case rate from 5 December stands at 504 cases per 100,000 people over seven days, a slight dip from the day before. People told BBC Wales of their concerns over Covid during the winter months. Lee Coburn, 46, from the Rhondda, and who lost his father Terry in March to Covid. 'I'm a bit apprehensive, the reason being I do have an elderly mum who's high at risk,\" he said. \"But also people need that time together with families, because it's been two years - so I think we could proceed with Christmas, but be cautious.\" Mr Coburn said he was worried for what was coming after Christmas: \"because if people are going to be partying, not being cautious then there's a massive wave going to hit us just after Christmas in January, and we'll be all in lockdown then until summertime like last year.\" Nesta Darch, 63, Pontypridd, said she would \"like to see perhaps more mandatory mask-wearing\". \"You mention it to the staff in the shops and they say we have no legal requirement to make people wear masks\", she said. Her husband Don said his family take lateral flow tests \"religiously\". \"We do them - my children are all teachers, I've got my 85-year-old mam who's housebound,\" he said. \"But the reliability of them, I'm not so sure. It's better than nothing, they do highlight some cases but I don't think you can 100% rely on lateral flow tests.\" \"This is a very difficult balance.\" So said the first minister in announcing no big changes to the Covid rules. It's difficult because there's an information deficit around the Omicron variant which makes it hard to predict its impact on the NHS in Wales - an NHS already under severe strain. But the first minister also said Wales \"may be about a week behind England and Scotland\", where rules have been tightened this week. With Covid reviews here in Wales now taking place weekly, the message looks clear - preserving the status quo this week is a long way away from a guarantee of no change next week. Mr Drakeford said there was still a lot that is not known about the variant, or how severe an illness it can cause. But he feared the speed the variant transmits meant it could infect large numbers of people, leading to an increase in hospital admissions. He said ministers would act early if data shows the variant is causing significant problems. But the first minister said he could not give a \"precise sense of what exactly would trigger action\". In the meantime, new guidance for visiting in care homes and hospitals is to be issued. \"We want to do all we can to support visiting where it is safe to do so but, if we see a new wave of cases, some strengthened measures to protect patients and residents may be needed\", Mr Drakeford said. The first minister refused to confirm or deny a report in political blog Guido Fawkes that claimed he called for a lockdown between Christmas and New Year. He said he would not be drawn into \"distorted accounts\" of a meeting he had with the other UK nations this week. The account of the meeting was a \"gross violation of the rules under which those meetings are conducted\", he said. He suggested the motivation for whoever spoke to the blog \"was simply to cause a distraction from the many, many difficulties that the UK government has experienced this week\". Welsh Conservative health spokesman Russell George said the Welsh government had taken the \"right approach\" to the Omicron variant by not announcing any major new restrictions on Friday. \"I don't think any of us want to see restrictions imposed on lives, particularly at the Christmas period,\" he said. Plaid Cymru leader Adam Price backed Mr Drakeford's decision to hold weekly-reviews of the Covid rules. He also supported Welsh government requests for more financial support from the UK government if tighter restrictions were to be introduced. ",

            "header": "LV= members reject sale to private equity firm Bain Capital",
            "content": "Members of LV= have rejected selling the insurance mutual to US private equity firm Bain Capital for £530m. The sale of LV= to Bain Capital had been controversial, drawing criticism from politicians from several parties. LV= chief executive Mark Hartigan had said that for the business to survive it needed to demutualise. But some LV= members had been unhappy over demutualisation and the size of payouts on offer from the deal. The Bain Capital takeover would have meant that LV= would lose its mutual status, with members given £100 each as part of the deal. But the sale did not get enough support from members. Although 69% of a possible 1.1 million voting members were in favour of the transaction with Bain Capital, 75% approval was needed for the sale to pass. The result followed a meeting in which members discussed whether the company should remain a mutual. Some LV= staff were unable to watch the general meeting on Friday, according to reports. LV= chairman Alan Cook said: \"We want to reassure policyholders that this outcome will mean no changes to their policies or our ongoing commitment to the highest standards of service from LV=.\" \"I will continue to lead the process to find a way forward that will enable us to provide the right financial outcome for all our members whilst respecting their different wishes,\" Mr Cook continued, and added that once a way forward had been determined, he would step down as chairman. Chief executive Mark Hartigan will continue in his role, the firm said. The firm said it would \"swiftly reassess its strategic options and explore alternative ways to provide the best long-term outcome for members, the business, employees and its wider communities\". The LV= board said it had \"listened to member concerns about the loss of mutuality and so will in particular explore whether mutuality can be retained either on a standalone basis without undue risk to members, or through a merger with a larger mutual organisation\". Bain Capital said it \"remains crucial\" that members are \"looked after and protected\". \"We have always wanted LV= to flourish and become a leading company in the sector, that offers more consumer choice and creates more jobs,\" a spokesperson added. Did this vote stir emotions? Most certainly, yes. It is, after all, about the future of a 178-year-old insurer owned by its members and founded to cover the funeral costs of Liverpool's poor. Did it raise some fundamental questions? Again, yes. They ranged from whether members should fund a long-term future they might not profit from, to the appropriateness of a private equity takeover. Was it a vote on the future of the mutual movement as a whole? No. LV= has specific problems, some of its own making. Experts say other mutuals have already navigated similar issues successfully. Meanwhile, mutual building societies still account for 23% of the UK residential mortgage market, hold 18% of people's cash savings, and have 40% of cash ISA balances. There are challenges, but as this vote shows - and the LV= board now acknowledges - there is plenty of life in the old mutual dog yet. LV= attracted a number of bids when it first proposed a sale of the business, including from rival mutual Royal London. LV=, which was founded in 1843 and formerly known as Liverpool Victoria, had pushed back against approaches from Royal London. It said that so-called \"with-profits\" members, who legally own LV=, should not have to \"finance a future that requires significant investment, which many would not benefit from\". Royal London said on Friday it had \"offered to enter into immediate and exclusive discussions with LV= to agree a mutual merger that will offer LV= customers the opportunity to have their life savings protected and invested by a mutual\". LV= said it had received an \"unsolicited preliminary merger proposal from Royal London\" on 8 December. \"The outline proposal from Royal London is at an early stage and is subject to discussion, due diligence and detailed negotiation of financial and other terms. There can be no certainty that a transaction will be agreed,\" LV= said. The LV= group had a \"challenged\" capital structure and operated in an increasingly competitive market dominated by well-capitalised, global insurers, it said when trying to convince members to vote for the sale. The heart of the problem, Mr Hartigan said earlier, was that because it was a mutual it was unable to raise funds due to a cap on its debts. ",

            "content": "Heathrow airport's boss has added his voice to those in the travel industry calling for UK nationals returning from red list countries to be able to isolate at home. John Holland-Kaye said families should be able to reunite for Christmas. The government has hinted over the past few days that a rule change is coming. Transport Secretary Grant Shapps has said he doesn't want the red list and hotel quarantine in place \"for a moment longer than necessary\". He said a time would come, \"probably no more than days or a short number of weeks away\", where the government would want to review and potentially remove countries from the red list. Heathrow said that travel restrictions, which have been re-imposed in response to the spread of the Omicron variant, had \"further dampen[ed] passenger confidence\". Omicron: What Covid tests do I need if I travel abroad?\nCovid: New Omicron travel rules come into force Mr Holland-Kaye said: \"By allowing Brits to isolate at home, ministers can make sure they are reunited with their loved ones this Christmas. \"It would send a strong signal that restrictions on travel will be removed as soon as safely possible to give passengers the confidence to book for 2022, opening up thousands of new jobs for local people at Heathrow.\" Speaking in the House of Commons on Thursday Health Secretary Sajid Javid said that \"very soon\", if Omicron became the dominant variant, there would be \"less need to have any kind of travel restrictions at all\". On Thursday Mr Shapps said red-listing was initially meant to slow things down, but that as the variant spread, the government accepted \"the inevitability that in the end it gets everywhere, exactly as Delta did\". The Transport Secretary said the UK's Health Security Agency had been asked to produce recommendations. He said it did not stand to reason that the red list helped once the Omicron variant was already established in this country. The Prime Minister, the Health Secretary and the Transport Secretary have all made clear hints this week that the further spread of Omicron - including within the UK - could prompt changes around the Red List. A decision has not been taken yet. Current measures are expected to be examined again next week. Ministers have said the temporary measure was designed to help reduce Omicron being brought into the country. Unlike the broader-brush testing rules introduced since, businesses supported it because it was targeted. However many would now like to see home isolation replace hotels, especially as Christmas approaches. The hotel quarantine system was mostly wound down when the Red list was empty. Capacity has been a challenge since it was re-activated at short notice. Brits trying to get home have told us about the stress and additional cost they've endured because the rooms weren't available on the date of their flight. At present 11 African countries are on the red list, and the Covid testing rules for entering the UK have been changed. All travellers age 12 and over must take a Covid test in the two days before setting off for the UK from any destination. People are also required to take a PCR test within two days of arrival. Tim Alderslade, chief executive of industry body Airlines UK, said: \"Omicron will soon be the dominant variant in the UK and we know there are many cases now independent of international travel. \"The Health Secretary understands well that travel restrictions are utterly futile when we have community transmission and that's why we're pushing hard for these latest, emergency restrictions to be rolled back at the 20 December review.\" ",

Recycled IT equipment and household goods make up the building's cladding, signs are from used coffee beans and insulation is provided by sheep wool. The fast-food company said it would be used as a \"blueprint\" for other sites and work has started to roll it out. Net zero means not adding to the amount of greenhouse gases in the atmosphere. It is the first restaurant in the UK due to be verified as net zero emissions for construction using the UK Green Building Council's (UKGBC's) net zero carbon buildings framework. The problems of decarbonising the construction industry were \"complex\", but the move by McDonald's was a \"critical first step\", UKGBC spokesman Simon McWhirter said. McDonald's spokeswoman Beth Hart said: \"We've already started to roll out some of these innovations to other restaurants, but what is exciting about Market Drayton is the fact it will act as a blueprint for our future new builds. \"We believe that our food needs to be served in restaurants that are sustainable for the future. Market Drayton is a big step towards making that a reality.\" Senior lecturer in the environment and sustainability at Keele University, Dr Sharon George, said the move was a \"positive step\" and a sign that the company was recognising that \"society's view of sustainability\" was changing. McDonald's and other fast food suppliers have previously come under fire from investors who signed a letter asking the firms to reduce the carbon footprint of their meat and dairy supply chains.

A fall in people dining out in restaurants and reductions in oil extraction and gas use meant growth came in lower than expected. Growth was stalling even before the emergence of the Omicron variant. One economist said the figures showed the \"steam has well and truly been taken out of the UK economic recovery\". Maike Currie, investment director at Fidelity International, warned October might be the \"closest the economy gets to reaching 'normal levels' until deep into 2022\". \"Supply chain issues, worker shortages and surging inflation put the dampeners on growth in October,\" she said. Ms Currie added there was a \"creeping sense of déjà vu\" over the impact Covid was having on the economy, with the government reintroducing some coronavirus restrictions in a bid to limit the spread of the new variant. \"Workers are heading back to their kitchen tables and the big festive season that retailers and the hospitality sector had their hopes pinned on - while starting on a high during Black Friday - might not have as much sparkle as hoped,\" she said. The Office for National Statistics (ONS) said the economy was still 0.5% below pre-pandemic levels, but added the services sector had returned to pre-pandemic levels. That has been driven a growth in GP face-to-face appointments, and an increase in staff employed in cleaning, building and security jobs. Art and entertainment services also increased as theatres full reopened. The slower overall economic growth has led to predictions the Bank of England will not put up interest rates next week. Susannah Streeter, senior investment and markets analyst at Hargreaves Lansdown, said although a rate rise couldn't be completely ruled out, \"most bets are off that the Bank will push them up so soon\", given the latest economic figures and uncertainty surrounding the Omicron coronavirus variant. She said a rate rise in February was \"more likely to be on the table, as the inflation kettle is set to be whistling loudly by then\", unless further Covid restrictions were put in place. Liz Martins, UK economist at HSBC said the latest figures on the economy were \"a little bit weaker than expected\", with economists expecting a 0.4% rise in October. In September, economic growth was 0.6%. Ms Martins told the Today programme the \"economy was stuttering a little bit\", despite the emergence of Omicron, which was largely due to supply chain issues and material and product shortages. \"It's public sector services, like those GP appointments, that's driving growth,\" she added. \"So, a little bit of private sector weakness here, no growth in manufacturing, and a fall in construction. \"The recovery is on pause in December at least, and hopefully we'll be able to restart in the New Year.\" The ONS said the strong services output was due to the \"continued rise\" of face-to-face appointments at GP surgeries in England. GDP or Gross Domestic Product is one of the most important ways of showing how well, or badly, an economy is doing. It's a measure - or an attempt to measure - all the activity of companies, governments and individuals in an economy. In the UK, new GDP figures are produced every month, but the quarterly figures - covering three months at a time - are the most widely watched. In a growing economy, quarterly GDP will be slightly bigger than the quarter before, a sign that people are doing more work and getting (on average) a little bit richer. Read more about GDP here. Grant Fitzner, ONS chief economist, said the \"UK health sector again grew strongly while second-hand car sales and employment agencies also boosted the economy\". However, Mr Fitzner said the construction industry saw its biggest drop since April 2020, with \"notable falls in house building and infrastructure work, \"partly driven by shortages in raw materials\". Though the health sector was the main driver behind October's growth in services, other industries such as travel and entertainment also increased. Responding to the figures, Chancellor of the Exchequer, Rishi Sunak said the government had \"always acknowledged there could be bumps on our road to recovery\". \"We have still been recovering quicker than expected, with more employees on payrolls than ever before and redundancies remaining low,\" he added. While you always have to be cautious not to over-interpret the official ONS estimates for economic growth over just one month, if the figures are borne out they show the economy slowing almost to a stop in October. This was the month that began with petrol stations that couldn't get enough petrol and energy prices jumping. It had previously been expected that the economy might be back to its pre-pandemic level by then. And remember - this is before the economy was hit by the Omicron variant and new restrictions. The chances that growth in 2021 will hit the level predicted in the Autumn Budget and Spending Review of 6.5% now look vanishingly small. And some economists are now saying it's touch-and-go whether we continue to grow in December - or head back into an economic contraction. The chances of a rise in interest rates to tame inflation in December, already low before this morning's news, are now even lower. A stagnating economy, combined with rapidly rising inflation and restrictions discouraging travel, is an unpleasant prospect over Christmas both for businesses and households. Especially without any new emergency support. ",

            "content": "Amazon has been fined $1.2bn (£910m) by Italy's anti-trust regulator. It said the tech giant had abused its market dominance by promoting its own logistics service, Fulfilment by Amazon (FBA). It claimed companies had to use the FBA service to access key benefits such as selling products with Prime delivery with no extra cost to customers, and participation in Black Friday sales. Amazon said it \"strongly disagreed\" with the decision, and would appeal. Amazon to pay $500,000 for not sharing Covid data The regulator ruled that Amazon put third-party sellers at a disadvantage by requiring use of its own service to access key benefits and events. \"Amazon has thus prevented third-party sellers from associating the Prime label with offers not managed with FBA,\" it said. The regulator insisted that access to such functions is \"crucial\" for sellers to achieve success on Amazon's Marketplace. It also said it would impose corrective steps which will be subject to review by a monitoring trustee. Amazon said in a statement that the fine was \"unjustified and disproportionate\". \"We strongly disagree with the decision of the Italian Competition Authority and we will appeal,\" said the company. \"Small and medium-sized businesses have multiple channels to sell their products both online and offline: Amazon is just one of those options. \"We constantly invest to support the growth of the 18,000 Italian SMBs [small and medium-sized businesses] that sell on Amazon, and we provide multiple tools to our sellers, including those who manage shipments themselves.\" The company added that third-party sellers can use its Seller Fulfilled Prime (SFP) service, which gives them access to Prime benefits without having to use its own logistics services. It marks the second fine against Amazon by Italian regulators in a matter of weeks after both it and Apple were fined $228m (£173m) for restricting Beats headphone sales, by limiting them to select retailers. Both Apple and Amazon said they plan to appeal against the fines. ",

            "header": "'Pubs may run out of cash as more work from home'",
            "content": "Hospitality firms have warned they face a collapse in demand at their busiest time of year due to the government's new work-from-home guidance. The measures, designed to slow the spread of the highly transmissible Omicron variant, come in from Monday. One trade body called them a \"body blow\" to already-struggling pubs, restaurants and entertainment venues. Pub chain boss Clive Watson said some pubs could \"run out of cash\" without extra help from the government. However, the government is not planning any new economic support measures. Mr Watson said the City Pub Company, which has 44 sites in England and Wales, was just starting to get back on its feet after a rough 18 months. But he said the government was \"turning off the life support machine yet again\" by bringing back home-working. New rules on home working and masks in England\nWhat's the new guidance on working from home?\nHow will Plan B affect the economy? \"From about 10 days ago office parties started to get cancelled [because of Omicron]. Going forward after yesterday's announcement that is only going to accelerate,\" he told the BBC's Today programme. \"What government has got to appreciate is for businesses, particularly in our sector, Christmas is always a key time.\" The City Pub Company makes about a third of its annual profits in December, which tides it over in the quiet months of January and February. Hospitality firms fear losing vital passing trade as more people work from home. Businesses from dry cleaners to coffee houses depend on an office crowd, particularly in city centres. By contrast, those that cater to people in their homes, such as takeaways and supermarkets stand to gain from the new guidance. We talked to firms that rely on commuters about how the new home-working guidance will affect them. David Abrahamovitch runs Grind, a chain of nine café restaurants in London, employing 250 staff. He also has a successful online store selling compostable coffee pods for Nespresso machines, and says he can \"fall back\" on that side of the business if things get tough. \"A lot of other hospitality businesses won't have that, so we're lucky,\" he told the BBC. \"But it will still be painful to watch the company go into reverse gear again.\" Grind relies on people coming into central London and has also has seen a big drop-off in Christmas party bookings since Omicron emerged, which Mr Abrahamovitch thinks will get worse. He is nervous about how the landlords he rents his shops from will react if things really slow down. \"They have already given a lot [of leeway in the pandemic], and everyone has their limits. They have businesses to run too.\" It's a similar story for James Greenhalgh, owner of the Flamingos Coffee House in Leeds city centre, who says about 50% his trade comes from the local office crowd. \"We've had such a hard time in the pandemic and things were just starting to pick up again. It's just so hard. I've genuinely thought about throwing in the towel.\" His thinks the government's approach will stifle business growth. He was just about to agree a lease on bigger second shop but has now put that plan on ice. \"The rules seem to change every week, which makes it impossible for businesses to plan ahead,\" he said. \"The government should have been clear with business owners what might happen if a new variant came along. They should have told us about the contingency plans.\" A study from the University of Sheffield suggests city centres stand to lose £3bn in 2022 due to more people working from home. Dr Jesse Matheson, lead author of the paper, said: \"This decrease will be concentrated in a few very dense centres; for example, the City of London will experience a spending decrease of 31.6%, and central Birmingham will experience a decrease of 8%. \"Some of this spending will be realised in the residential areas where these workers live, but some may be lost altogether.\" Rich Bool was already noticing more staff working from home, even before the latest restrictions. He runs a mobile café, making up to 30 trips a day to offices and industrial estates. \"It can be so difficult trying to work out from one week to the next what stocks and sandwiches you need,\" he told the BBC. \"There are just so many variables. More uncertainty is never welcome.\" He has, however, learned a lot from previous lockdowns and mass home-working. Having a van means his Chippenham-based Cafe2U service can be nimble, going to where the best custom might be. Mr Bool now even visits some customers at their homes. \"We've built up a trusted relationship with some of our customers when we went to their offices. Now we take our food and drink to a few of them at home,\" he said. \"Obviously it's easy to make your own sandwich. But when you're working from home all the time, sometimes it's good to buy something if it's on your doorstep.\" ",

            "content": "Parcel firms will be expected to improve how they handle complaints under new proposals aimed at improving customer service. Regulator Ofcom said nearly two-thirds of customers it surveyed in January had suffered problems with deliveries. When things go wrong, such as parcels being lost, customers often have problems resolving complaints, it said. Deliveries have grown significantly in the pandemic driven by rapid growth in online shopping. Ofcom said parcel deliveries were \"increasingly important\" to people's daily lives. \"We're planning to strengthen our rules to make sure people are treated fairly by delivery firms,\" said Lindsey Fussell, Ofcom's networks and communications group director. \"If we don't see significant improvements in customer service, we'll consider enforcement action or tighten regulations further.\" Under the new proposals, customers must be: told who to contact, and what channels they can use to make a complaint;\ntold what the complaint process will be, and how long it will take to resolve;\ndealt with by staff who have received appropriate training. Disabled customers, who are more likely to get problem deliveries, need to be treated more fairly, the watchdog said. Common problems disabled people experience include \"couriers not allowing enough time at the door, parcels being left in inaccessible places, and operators not acting on specific delivery instructions provided to them\". Under the proposals, firms will have to follow clear procedures to treat disabled customers fairly, including making sure customers can set out their needs and that couriers can follow those instructions. While the vast majority of the 10 million parcels scheduled for delivery every day arrive without incident, getting help when things go wrong can be frustrating. Even when the contact details of the delivery firms are accessible, resolving problems may take longer than the initial delivery timeframe. Ofcom's proposal to encourage better complaint handling comes as part of its five-year review of postal regulation - which it says \"must keep pace with changes in the market and remain relevant\". But some are concerned that the regulator is already behind with delivery. Even before the pandemic accelerated the trend, an increasing amount of shopping was happening online. It wasn't until this March that Ofcom called for views on the subject of parcel delivery. Having reflected on those, it has proposed these extra guidelines. But it will now consult on those until next March - with a view to introducing them in summer. Even then, they'll only be guidelines, with the regulator touting the possibility of future enforcement action or regulation if it doesn't see an improvement in customer service and complaints handling. In the meantime, customers may be left hanging by the letterbox, with a reminder that they can legally seek redress from retailers if deliveries fail to appear. Ofcom said that people were most satisfied with deliveries from Amazon, which had an 89% approval rating. Royal Mail had an 80% rating, while Hermes scored least on satisfaction with deliveries, at 57%. Online shopping has boomed during the coronavirus pandemic, Ofcom said in a separate report on postal services. Parcel volumes grew nearly 50% in 2020-21 compared with the previous year, with 4.2 billion items delivered \"mainly driven by an increase in online shopping as a result of the Covid-19 pandemic\", it said. While Royal Mail's quality of service fell due to \"the introduction of social distancing, high levels of staff absence and a significant unforeseen increase in parcel volumes\", its revenue and profits increased.

            "content": "Andy Barwell's debt difficulties began when he was a rugby-playing teenager. Paying off creditors will go on long after his playing days are over. Now he sees lots of young men taking the same financial risks, some of whom are inspired by images of wealth and the high life as they scroll through social media. \"You can't live a champagne life on a lemonade budget,\" he said. \"You need to have the money in the bank.\" The temptation to overindulge and be left with a financial hangover is clear during the festive season. With the cost of living rising, the extra expense of even a basic celebration is pushing others to the financial brink. A YouGov survey for the BBC suggested that about half of those aged up to 45 admitted they were likely to spend more than they should this Christmas.

More than 17 million have used buy now, pay later\nCovid debt cycle linked to mental health issues Andy, now a 30-year-old father of two, said he loved Christmas, but remembered it as a highly stressful time when he was trying to please friends, family and a new partner, even though he had no money. One Christmas Eve, his money worries were so intense that he rang the Samaritans. His debt peaked at £35,000. \"Eventually I realised I would never get my head above water. On the first of the month I was paid, on the second I was paying off cards and by the middle on the month I had nothing. It was a vicious cycle,\" he said.

Anyone in the same situation should speak to someone now. Don't wait. Don't be embarrassed about it,\" he said. The concern is that during a Christmas with fewer Covid restrictions, but rising bills and prices, more people are financially vulnerable. Research taken from 9.5 million customers of the large credit management and debt collection company Lowell shows that credit use is starting to rise again after the height of the pandemic. Covid support schemes, such as payment holidays, helped to keep a lid on some debt issues, but many of those allowances have now been withdrawn. The company's UK Financial Vulnerability Index suggests there are now greater risks of people missing repayments or being left without savings for emergency expenditure. \"We are concerned about our nation's financial health. With Covid support falling away, we can already see vulnerability ticking up. This has been rising since 2017 and we need to have an honest conversation about why,\" said Lowell's chief executive, John Pears. Other survey findings include: Of those who do expect to borrow to pay for Christmas, a quarter (24%) said it would take a year or more to pay back the money, a survey for StepChange suggested\nSome 27% of those asked in a YouGov survey for the BBC said that \"the cost of Christmas makes it all too stressful\"\nCitizens Advice said that one in 10 families were facing a financial crisis this winter because they were unable to meet their essential costs Research from England's Illegal Money Lending Team found that Christmas was the second most likely reason for people borrowing money from loan sharks, after paying for essentials such as food, rent or mortgage, and utility bills. Sue Anderson, from StepChange, said that families determined to enjoy Christmas despite bills rising could make things difficult when the credit demands arrived in the new year. \"The cost of the festive season can be the straw that breaks the camel's back for people already struggling,\" she said. \"This year, our research suggests that a significantly increased number of people may turn to credit to make ends meet over Christmas. People are also widely worrying about the increasing general cost of living and specific price hikes in the cost of essentials such as energy.\" As some people face those financial difficulties, fears have been raised about reductions in the availability of free. face-to-face debt advice. New contracts from the Money and Pensions Service, which funds most free debt advice in England, will see more money spent on help given over the phone or online. ",

US boss fires 900 employees over Zoom\nThe big company Christmas party is off this year\n'My billion pound company has no HR department' \"If you're on this call you're part of the unlucky group being laid off,\" Mr Garg told staff in the call last week. \"Your employment here is terminated. Effective immediately.\" A recording of the call was shared on social media, prompting comments that sacking people this way was \"cold\", \"harsh\" and \"a horrible move\", especially in the run up to Christmas. Better.com, which aims to use technology to make the housebuying process \"faster and more efficient\", confirmed earlier this year that it plans to float the company on the stock market. A deal is likely to value the business - which Mr Garg founded in 2015 - at between $6.9bn (£5.2bn) and $7.7bn. \"Hi everyone, thank you for joining. I come to you with not great news. The market has changed, as you know, and we have to move with it in order to survive so that hopefully we can continue to thrive and deliver on our mission. \"This isn't news that you're going to want to hear but ultimately it was my decision and I wanted you to hear it from me. It's been a really, really challenging decision to make. This is the second time in my career that I'm doing this and I do not want to do this. The last time I did it I cried. This time I hope to be stronger. But we are laying off about 15% of the company for [a number of] reasons: the market, efficiency and performances and productivity. \"If you're on this call you are part of the unlucky group that is being laid off. Your employment here is terminated. Effective immediately.\" Mr Garg told staff he was grateful for their contribution. \"I believe in you, I believe in Better, and I believe that working together we can make homeownership better together,\" he wrote. \"Organisations do have to make job cuts sometimes, it is a hard reality,\" says Rachel Suff, senior policy adviser on employee relations at the Chartered Institute of Personnel and Development. \"But how they go about it and the humanity they approach it with can have a fundamental impact on how people deal with that shocking news.\" Ms Suff points out that the situation facing Better.com's staff in the US would not happen in the UK. Legally, UK employers have to enter a consultation period with workers of at least 30 days, or 45 days if more than 100 people are being made redundant. During that period \"people should be given the right phrasing, eased into it, given warning, prepared for the news and explained the reasons why\", she says. UK employers also have to look for alternative roles for workers. \"An employer really needs to tell people that they've exhausted every possible alternative, it is the last thing they wanted to do - it is about being able to leave with your dignity and respect intact.\" Ms Suff adds that while a lot of focus regarding Better.com has been about Mr Garg using Zoom to fire staff, the approach is incredibly important. \"If you notice as well [Mr Garg] talks about the impact on himself. He says: 'I cried the last time'. But who's losing their job here? It was very rich, talking about the impact on himself - what about them?\" ",

            "content": "The pace of holiday bookings is slowing down after the emergence of the Omicron coronavirus variant, holiday giant Tui has said. Reports of higher infection rates are also putting a dampener on bookings, especially for this winter, Tui said. Despite this, it expects bookings for next summer to be close to pre-pandemic levels. New UK travel rules to try to prevent the spread of the Omicron variant came into effect on Tuesday. The changes include include pre-departure tests for people arriving in the UK, while 11 African countries have been put on the red list for travel. The travel industry warned on Monday that the new rules would be a \"hammer blow\" and that livelihoods would be \"devastated\". Covid: Travel changes too late to halt potential new wave - scientist\nOmicron: What Covid tests do I need if I travel abroad? Tui said it had 4.1 million bookings for its next winter and summer seasons, with 1.4 million bookings since 3 October. However, it said: \"The increased media coverage of rising incident rates and the emergence of new Omicron variant has weakened this positive momentum, particularly for winter.\" Winter bookings were returning to pre-pandemic levels before \"recent news coverage\" of the pandemic, Tui said. Over the past week, a quarter of Tui holidays booked for December had been postponed to a later date, it told the BBC. The holiday firm narrowed its loss before tax to €71m (£60.5m) in the fourth quarter of the year to 30 September, compared with a loss in the same period last year of €836m. It didn't say how much it expected to make next year. After such a tumultuous couple of years for the travel industry, businesses are pinning their hopes on a strong 2022 summer season. There's been some optimism in the air. However, the uncertainty around Omicron has prompted fears of a hit to consumer confidence, especially as a result of the re-introduction of temporary rules around international travel - with the UK bringing back the red list and extra Covid testing requirements. So far it's short-term bookings being affected. The real problem will arise if people who might normally make their summer holiday booking after Christmas or in January decide not to. The industry will be crossing its fingers that the bumper summer it needs does still come to pass. Tui chief executive Friedrich Joussen said that uncertainty over travel restrictions was \"annoying\". \"Overnight you get new rules,\" he said. \"You have gone on vacation thinking nothing can happen, then tens of thousands or hundreds of thousands of people have new rules and that is difficult.\" He called on the government to give the travel industry more notice about upcoming rule changes. Mr Joussen added that Tui partially subsidises the costs of PCR tests, which has some financial impact on the business. While Omicron symptoms have so far been mild, there are early signs it is more transmissible than the Delta variant. Following the new UK border restrictions brought in after the emergence of Omicron, more than one in eight UK tourism firms that cater for foreign visitors have had cancellations or expect to have them in the run-up to Christmas, industry body UKInbound said. It said a survey of its members suggested \"green shoots of recovery\" had been \"put on hold\". Its chief executive Joss Croft said: \"Although thoroughly depressing, these results are not surprising. \"International consumer confidence to travel to the UK has taken another huge hit, and the UK's kneejerk decisions and lack of support for businesses that bear the consequences, means the recovery of this industry has already been derailed.\" He added that firms needed \"emergency support\" and that they had \"no wiggle room left\". \"The summer season was all but lost for them, they have depleted their cash reserves and maxed out loans,\" he said.

            "content": "Christmas dinner is set to cost more this year with the price of staples such as turkey, Brussels sprouts and Christmas pudding all higher, according to analyst firm Kantar. A meal for four now costs £27.48 on average, up 3.4% from last year. But this has not dented people's \"desire to treat themselves and loved ones\" this Christmas, Kantar said. The food industry has been grappling with soaring energy costs, supply chain disruption and labour shortages. The average cost of a frozen turkey has jumped 7% in price to £12.46, while Christmas pudding, potatoes, Brussels sprouts and cauliflower are all up 5% compared with last year, Kantar said. \"As we count down on our advent calendars to the big day, it's clear that shoppers want to have some fun and make this Christmas extra special,\" Kantar said. \"Price inflation doesn't seem to be denting their desire to treat themselves and loved ones, and supermarket premium own-label ranges, such as Tesco Finest and Asda Extra Special, are the fastest growing ranges in store.\" Inflation: Global food prices hit fresh 10-year high, UN says\nInflation: Food price rises are terrifying, warns industry In the past four weeks, grocery prices across the board have jumped 3.2% compared with last November, Kantar said. While this is the highest rate of food inflation since June 2020, the research firm said it had not affected shopping behaviour so far. \"Habits we'd expect to see shift, like swapping branded products for own-label or seeking out promotions, haven't altered just yet,\" Kantar said. Tanya, mother of a 10-year-old son, who lives in Braintree, Essex told the BBC her food shopping bills have already increased by around £20 per month. Tanya earns a teaching assistant's salary and orders home deliveries from Tesco's. \"I'm really good with budgeting, but I'm only heating one room in the house at the moment because of my higher electric bills,\" she says. Her son will be having Christmas dinner at his Dad's, but Tanya says she is reducing the number of presents she's buying this year for her family. \"Luckily my son hasn't asked for anything big and I've agreed with the rest of my family not to go all out as usual because costs are so high this year,\" she says. \"I'm really worried about electric and heating going up this winter, while my wages have remained the same.\" Chris Birt, associate director at the Joseph Rowntree Foundation, told the BBC that because families on low incomes spend a greater share of their income on food, the continuing price rises are going to hit them particularly hard. \"In the wake of the recent cut to Universal Credit, there are families who will be left hungry and cold this winter,\" he said. \"The government must, at a bare minimum, make sure that everyone has access to enough support so they can afford the basics.\" Professor of economics at the University of Bath, Chris Martin, said the rise in the cost of Christmas dinner was in line with the rising cost of living more generally, resulting in real effects on people's spending power. \"Workers whose wages haven't increased in line with inflation tend to be those on lower wages who were also hit worse by the pandemic,\" he said. While some workers in high demand sectors such as IT or supply chain logistics have had a substantial pay increases, around 65% to 70% of the UK workforce have not seen increased wages, he said. This includes almost all workers in the public sector, which represent around 40% of the workforce and at least half of those working in the private sector, Prof Martin said. \"All the forecasts are telling us this will be a serious issue for at least three to four years and it will likely cause lasting economic damage,\" he said.

            "content": "The Treasury has warned that high public sector pay settlements could lead to permanently higher prices and interest rates. It said this could also mean less spending on key public sector services. The official economic submission to pay review bodies for over 2 million public sector workers comes as unions warn that the Government needs to more than match inflation rates. The inflation rate is heading above 4 or 5% in the coming months. Today's document is an attempt to argue the current high rates of inflation are a temporary phenomenon that should not form the basis of public sector pay awards. The setting of wages in the public sector should instead \"have regard\" to the government and the Bank of England's inflation target of 2%. Christmas dinner costs rise as inflation bites\nHouse price growth at 15-year high, says Halifax\nWhy is the cost of living going up? Indeed the document heavily implies that if public sector gives wage rises that exceed or even match 4-5% it will cause inflation to last longer, by encouraging higher wage demands. The submission says \"inflation could become more durable if people come to expect high inflation to continue, for example if workers demand larger wage increases to maintain their purchasing power\". It specifically argued that high public sector settlements will encourage similar in the private sector: \"If public sector pay increases were to exacerbate temporary inflationary pressure, for instance through spilling over into higher wage demands across the economy or contributing to higher inflation expectations, then these short-term pressures would become more sustained\". That would, in turn, harm growth, exacerbate cost of living pressures and require higher interest rates, the document argues. The submission also argues that higher public sector wage rises will divert funding meant for frontline services such as the NHS and social care, and rejects the argument made by unions that workers should be compensated for the coming squeeze from national insurance rises. While officially the public sector pay freeze is over, if some public sector workers receive wage rises below the expected rate of inflation, it would effectively be a cut to real incomes. Inflation is expected to be above 5% in April next year, as a result of rises in energy prices. Next year Government departments will make submissions to the independent Pay Review Bodies about the affordability of pay rises, as well as an assessment of recruitment and retention, before final recommendations are made to ministers. Some unions are already consulting members over strike action as regards this year's settlements. ",

He did not mention the $750m (£565m) cash infusion Better.com received from Softbank, the Japanese firm and key investor, last week. Better.com's chief finance officer, Kevin Ryan, told the BBC: \"Having to conduct layoffs is gut-wrenching, especially this time of year.\" He added, however, that having \"a fortress balance sheet and a reduced and focused workforce\" was necessary to take on the \"radically evolving homeownership market\". \"Hi everyone, thank you for joining.

A deal is likely to value the business - which Mr Garg founded in 2015 - at between $6.9bn (£5.2bn) and $7.7bn. Ms Francke suggested the way in which Mr Garg fired his staff could have an effect on Better.com's future business. \"This is a customer-facing business, they are trying to provide people with mortgages. I'm sure many customers or potential customers are thinking: 'Gee whizz, if they treat their employees this way I wonder how they treat their customers?'.\" After the firing, Fortune magazine said that Mr Garg was the author of a previously written anonymous blog post in which he accused sacked staff at his firm of \"stealing\" from their colleagues and customers by being unproductive and only working two hours a day, while claiming for eight or more. Mr Garg's management style has also been criticised before, after an email that he sent to staff that was obtained by Forbes last year. In the email, Mr Garg wrote: \"You are TOO DAMN SLOW. You are a bunch of DUMB DOLPHINS... SO STOP IT. STOP IT. STOP IT RIGHT NOW. YOU ARE EMBARRASSING ME.\" Business Insider reported that after firing 900 staff, Mr Garg held a subsequent \"town hall\" meeting with remaining workers. Better.com had recruited high numbers of staff during the pandemic. But Mr Garg reportedly told his staff: \"Today, we acknowledge that we overhired and hired the wrong people, and in doing that, we failed. \"I failed. I was not disciplined over the last 18 months.\" \"Organisations do have to make job cuts sometimes, it is a hard reality,\" says Rachel Suff, senior policy adviser on employee relations at the Chartered Institute of Personnel and Development. \"But how they go about it and the humanity they approach it with can have a fundamental impact on how people deal with that shocking news.\" Ms Suff points out that the situation facing Better.com's staff in the US would not happen in the UK.

A complaint from a whistleblower prompted the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) to investigate. Steven Henkes, a former field quality manager for Tesla, alleges the company failed to properly notify shareholders and the public about the risks. Tesla solar systems have been known to catch fire in a small number of cases. Mr Henkes's complaint, filed more than a year ago, alleged Tesla had failed to properly disclose defects with some electrical connectors could cause fires and instead told customers it had had to carry out maintenance to prevent a problem shutting down the solar-panel systems. \"We have confirmed with Division of Enforcement staff that the investigation from which you seek records is still active and ongoing,\" the SEC told Mr Henkes, in a letter the Reuters news agency said it had independently verified. The SEC made clear in its letter the investigation should not be taken as confirmation there had been any legal violations. Mr Henkes was fired from Tesla and sued the company over his dismissal. Shares in the company fell by more than 6% shortly after news of the SEC's investigation was published, though they have since risen again slightly. Alleged fire safety issues with Tesla's solar panels have been reported before. In 2019, US retailer Walmart sued Tesla over fires at seven outlets where the panels had been installed. The legal action was later dropped, following a settlement agreement. Tesla abolished its public-relations department in 2020, so could not be contacted for comment. ",

            "content": "House prices in the UK grew at the fastest pace in 15 years over the past three months, the Halifax has said. House prices rose 3.4% in the three months to the end of November, the sharpest increase since late 2006, and are 8.2% higher than a year earlier. The average UK property price hit a fresh record high of £272,992 in November, the mortgage lender said. However, it said the pace of growth was unlikely to continue next year as household finances come under pressure. House prices in the UK have been rising for the past five months, Halifax said. This was \"underpinned by a shortage of available properties, a strong labour market and keen competition amongst mortgage providers keeping rates close to historic lows,\" said Russell Galley, managing director of the Halifax. House prices still rising but demand set to cool\nIn need of modernisation? The UK's housing crisis close up The coronavirus pandemic has added pressure to the housing market, with the stamp duty holiday that fuelled earlier demand, although there have been fewer completions since the tax break ended at the end of September, Halifax said. Borrowing costs are cheap due to record low interest rates making mortgages more attractive, and the jobs market is booming. There has been a so-called \"race for space\" as people spending more time at home during the pandemic looked for larger properties - although there are signs this is easing as flats start to become more popular again, Halifax said. However, the lender added that the fast pace of house price inflation is not likely to continue in the next year. Interest rates are expected to rise to combat inflation, although when that will happen has been thrown into doubt by uncertainty over the Omicron variant of coronavirus. But there are factors outside of the pandemic that point to a slower pace of house price inflation, Halifax said. Houses have never been less affordable, it said, and \"household budgets are only likely to come under greater pressure in the coming months\". Danni Hewson, a financial analyst at AJ Bell, said: \"Lockdowns which forced many of us to spend weeks within the confines of our homes also made many of us rethink what it was we wanted from those four walls. \"Mix in a stamp duty holiday and you got a recipe to set the housing market on fire.\" She said the market was \"still toasty warm\" even after the end of the stamp duty holiday. However, she said uncertainty over the Omicron variant was \"likely to slow the market and there is no doubt that the kind of price rises that we've seen over the last 18 months are unsustainable\".

            "content": "Virgin Media O2 says it has completed an upgrade enabling gigabit speeds at all 15.5 million homes on its network. Gigabit broadband means speeds of more than 1,000Mbps (megabits per second) - about 20 times the average home connection speed. Reaching such speeds has been a government goal since it made election pledges on broadband in 2019. Virgin says it has \"single-handedly\" delivered nearly two-thirds of the government goal. The scale of the rollout, which took about two years, is \"extremely impressive\", said analyst Paolo Pescatore from PP Foresight. But Virgin had an easier time of it than other broadband providers, as it updated its systems to provide better performance on its existing wires. \"In essence this overlay boosts capacity and download speeds rather than having to dig up roads and install new cables,\" Mr Pescatore said. Internet speed seen as top homebuyer priority\nSwansea street has fastest broadband in UK And Virgin \"clearly lags its rivals on fibre, which is an area that remains a key battleground for all providers\", he warned - as so-called \"full-fibre\" may offer much better speeds in the future. As a result of this upgrade, Virgin now says its gigabit network is \"more than twice the size of its nearest competitor\". The company says every home on its network can now access network speeds of up to 1,130Mbps. Recent research from telecoms regulator Ofcom found the average home broadband connection stood at 50.4Mbps. Customers must pay more for access to the highest-speed packages, with full gigabit speeds costing at least £62 a month. Virgin's progress completing the upgrade is being welcomed, with Digital Secretary Nadine Dorries saying that high-speed internet remains a \"top priority\". \"Virgin Media O2's efforts mean we're making quick progress in our mission to level up the UK with better connectivity,\" she said. \"We must ensure that rural areas are not left behind,\" she added, pointing to promised investments for \"hard-to-reach communities\". Virgin's chief executive Lutz Schüler said the company's investment \"has catapulted the UK's digital infrastructure forward by a decade and forced others to up their game\". \"As the country's largest gigabit provider by far, we're the driving force behind widespread gigabit availability four years ahead of the Government's target,\" he said. He also stressed that the company planned to invest more in the next decade. In 2019, Prime Minister Boris Johnson promised to have full-fibre broadband in every home by 2025, eight years sooner than previous plans. Amid scepticism from the industry over that goal, it was later revised to be \"gigabit-capable\" broadband, rather than full fibre - which meant Virgin's network would be included in the numbers. The goal was also later downgraded from every home to 85% of premises. Mr Pescatore said that changes to government targets \"certainly worked in [Virgin's] favour\". But for now, most consumers do not need - or are willing to pay for - such high speeds. \"Not everyone will demand gigabit connectivity. People are now more price-conscious than ever, and value connectivity above anything else,\" he said. But despite that, offering fast speeds as an option is a \"key battleground\" for providers. \"People's insatiable appetite for always-on connectivity is showing no signs of slowing down, meaning more and new emerging devices in the home will need to be connected all the time - requiring better connections throughout the home, something that is proving to be an important area for households.\" ",

            "content": "Donald Trump's deal to float his social media firm on the stock market is being investigated by Wall Street watchdogs. Regulators are probing Digital World Acquisition Corp, the firm set to merge with Trump Media and Technology Group (TMTG). According to a filing on Monday, the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) requested documents about its investors and trading. TMTG plans to launch a social media app called Truth Social early next year. The filing states that the SEC also asked to see information detailing the relationship between Digital World and TMTG. It also said that the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority (FINRA) is probing the deal as well. The SEC told the BBC it does not comment on the \"existence or nonexistence of a possible investigation\". The BBC has contacted TMTG for comment. Trump social media firm says it has raised $1bn\nSteve Bannon pleads not guilty to contempt charge\nRights groups condemn Trump migrant policy return The SEC was requested by Democratic Senator Elizabeth Warren last month, to investigate the proposed merger of the two firms for potential violations of securities laws. Digital World is a so-called special purpose acquisition company (Spac) or \"blank cheque company\". Spacs, which became a major story in the US stock market at the start of this year, are shell companies that are set up with the sole purpose of merging with a private firm to take it public. However, they have lost much of their lustre after some of the companies that merged with them failed to deliver on their ambitious financial projections. On Saturday, Mr Trump's firm said it had secured $1bn from \"a diverse group of institutional investors\" without revealing who they were. According to reports, the social media venture is now valued at almost $4bn. The former US president is still banned from Twitter and Facebook following the 6 January attack on the US Capitol. At the time he was banned Mr Trump had 89 million followers on Twitter, 33 million on Facebook and 24.5 million on Instagram, according to a presentation on his company's website. ",

            "content": "Sainsbury's has asked workers to postpone their Christmas parties until the new year following the emergence of the Omicron Covid variant. The supermarket said the situation was \"very delicate\", adding \"we need to do everything we can to make Christmas safe\" for staff and customers. Postponing parties would help protect food supply chains, the firm said. Sainsbury's boss Simon Roberts said the firm \"will make sure no-one is out of pocket as a result of this decision\". Other businesses are choosing to scale back festive gatherings this year. It follows uncertainty over the new Omicron strain of Covid which has stoked safety concerns over large parties this Christmas. Covid: Is it safe to hit the office Christmas party? Last week, Science Minister George Freeman told the BBC it was up to individual businesses to decide whether to hold a Christmas celebration. \"Some companies might normally bring hundreds of people in from around the world to a big party, and they may decide, this year, is that sensible given the pandemic and given where we are\", he said. There are concerns that the emergence of the new Covid variant could lead to higher staff absences over Sainsbury's busy festive period. \"The industry issues on labour and recruitment are well known and are ongoing and we are doing everything we can to avoid increased absence,\" said Sainsbury's, which also owns Argos and Habitat. Prime Minister Boris Johnson recently announced that even those who have been fully vaccinated must self-isolate if they come into contact with someone who has the Omicron variant of Covid. Sainsbury's was among a number of supermarkets in the UK who fell foul of the so-called \"pingdemic\" in the summer. Hundreds of thousands of people who used the NHS Test and Trace app in England and Wales were forced to self-isolate if they came into contact with someone with Covid, even if they had received both vaccine jabs. It led to worker shortages and empty shelves. The rule was changed on 16 August to allow fully vaccinated people to keep working, but if Omicron proves to be more easily transmissible than other variants it could place more pressure on retailers and other businesses during the busiest time of the year. Sainsbury's said it took the decision to delay Christmas parties after discussions with its store employee representative group. Mr Roberts said: \"We are doing everything we can to protect Christmas for our colleagues and our customers and keep everyone safe. \"As government guidance on face coverings changed on Tuesday (30 November), we have gone above and beyond to put safety first and have asked all of our colleagues to wear a face covering both on the shop floor and in all colleague areas.\" ",

            "content": "Fears about the future of Chinese property giant Evergrande Group have returned amid news it could default on its latest debt repayment. Shares in the company, whose crisis has rippled through the wider property and banking sectors, plunged up to 20% on Monday to a record low. In a statement over the weekend, Evergrande said it could not guarantee \"to perform its financial obligations\". It has liabilities of £300bn (£226bn), including to firms outside China. There were reports the property developer's billionaire founder Hui Ka Yan was summoned by Chinese officials to explain the latest situation. Evergrande's statement said: \"In light of the current liquidity status of the group, there is no guarantee that the group will have sufficient funds to continue to perform its financial obligations. \"The company received a demand to perform its obligations under a guarantee in the amount of approximately $260m. \"In the event that the group is unable to meet its guarantee obligations or certain other financial obligations, it may lead to creditors demanding acceleration of repayment.\" Conita Hung, investment director at Tiger Faith Asset Management, said that despite Evergrande trying to sell assets for months in an attempt to repay debts, the latest statement suggested the company was going to \"surrender and need help\". \"This sends a very bad signal,\" she said, adding that Evergrande's problems will take years to resolve even with help from the Chinese government.

What is Evergrande and is it too big to fail?\nEvergrande sells streaming firm stake for $273m China's booming housing and commercial property market prompted Xi Jinping's government in Beijing to restrict reckless lending to a sector that some experts feared faced collapse. Evergrande was one of a number of developers starved of cash due to the regulatory curbs on borrowing, but this led to offshore debt defaults, credit-rating downgrades and sell-offs in developers' shares and bonds. To stem the turmoil, in October regulators urged banks to relax lending for developers and allow property firms to raise more money from investors. On Monday, smaller property developer Sunshine 100 China Holdings said it had defaulted on a $170m debt payment \"owing to liquidity issues arising from the adverse impact of a number of factors including the macroeconomic environment and the real estate industry\".

            "header": "Parag Agrawal: Why Indian-born CEOs dominate Silicon Valley",
            "content": "Parag Agrawal, who was appointed this week as Twitter's CEO, has joined at least a dozen other Indian-born techies in the corner offices of the world's most influential Silicon Valley companies. Microsoft's Satya Nadella, Alphabet's Sundar Pichai, and the top bosses of IBM, Adobe, Palo Alto Networks, VMWare and Vimeo are all of Indian descent. Indian-origin people account for just about 1% of the US population and 6% of Silicon Valley's workforce - and yet are disproportionately represented in the top brass. Why? \"No other nation in the world 'trains' so many citizens in such a gladiatorial manner as India does,\" says R Gopalakrishnan, former executive director of Tata Sons and co-author of The Made in India Manager. \"From birth certificates to death certificates, from school admissions to getting jobs, from infrastructural inadequacies to insufficient capacities,\" growing up in India equips Indians to be \"natural managers,\" he adds, quoting the famous Indian corporate strategist C K Prahalad. The competition and chaos, in other words, makes them adaptable problem-solvers - and, he adds, the fact that they often prioritise the professional over the personal helps in an American office culture of overwork. Indians celebrate new Twitter CEO Parag Agrawal\nWho is Sundar Pichai and what does Alphabet do? \"These are characteristics of top leaders anywhere in the world,\" Mr Gopalakrishnan says. Indian-born Silicon Valley CEOs are also part of a four million-strong minority group that is among the wealthiest and most educated in the US. About a million of them are scientists and engineers. More than 70% of H-1B visas - work permits for foreigners - issued by the US go to Indian software engineers, and 40% of all foreign-born engineers in cities like Seattle are from India. \"This is the result of a drastic shift in US immigration policy in the 1960s,\" write the authors of The Other One Percent: Indians in America. In the wake of the civil rights movement, national-origin quotas were replaced by those that gave preference to skills and family unification. Soon after, highly-educated Indians - scientists, engineers and doctors at first, and then, overwhelmingly, software programmers - began to arrive in the US. This cohort of Indian immigrants did not \"resemble any other immigrant group from any other nation\", the authors say. They were \"triply selected\" - not only were they among the upper-caste privileged Indians who could afford to go to a reputed college, but they also belonged to a smaller sliver that could finance a masters in the US, which many of Silicon Valley's CEOs possess. And finally, the visa system further narrowed it down to those with specific skills - often in science, technology, engineering and maths or STEM as the preferred category is known - that meet the US's \"high-end labour market needs\". \"This is the cream of the crop and they are joining companies where the best rise to the top,\" says technology entrepreneur and academic Vivek Wadhwa. \"The networks they have built [in Silicon Valley] have also given them an advantage - the idea was that they would help each other.\" Mr Wadhwa adds that many of the India-born CEOs have also worked their way up the company ladder - and this, he believes, gives them a sense of humility that distinguishes them from many founder-CEOs who have been accused of being arrogant and entitled in their vision and management. Mr Wadhwa says men like Mr Nadella and Mr Pichai also bring a certain amount of caution, reflection and a \"gentler\" culture that makes them ideal candidates for the top job - especially at a time when big tech's reputation has plummeted amid Congressional hearings, rows with foreign governments and the widening gulf between Silicon Valley's richest and the rest of America. Their \"low-key, non-abrasive leadership\" is a huge plus, says Saritha Rai, who covers the tech industry in India for Bloomberg News. India's diverse society, with so many customs and languages, \"gives them [Indian-born managers] the ability to navigate complex situations, particularly when it comes to scaling organisations,\" says Indian-American billionaire businessman and venture capitalist Vinod Khosla, who co-founded Sun Microsystems. \"This plus a 'hard-work' ethic sets them up well,\" he adds. There are more obvious reasons as well. The fact that so many Indians can speak English makes it easier for them to integrate into the diverse US tech industry. And Indian education's emphasis on math and science has created a thriving software industry, training graduates in the right skills, which are further buttressed in top engineering or management schools in the US. \"In other words, the success of Indian-born CEOs in America is as much about what's right with America - or at least what used to be right before immigration became more restricted after 9/11 - as what's right with India,\" economist Rupa Subramanya recently wrote in Foreign Policy magazine. The huge backlog in the applications for US green cards, and increasing opportunities in the Indian market have certainly dimmed the allure of a career abroad. \"The American dream is getting replaced with the India-based start-up dream,\" Ms Rai says. The recent emergence of India's \"unicorns\"- companies worth more than a $1bn - suggests that the country is starting to produce major tech companies, experts say. But, they add, it's too early to tell what global impact they will have. \"India's start-up ecosystem is relatively young. Role models of successful Indians both in entrepreneurship and in executive ranks have helped a lot but role models take time to spread,\" Mr Khosla says. But most of the role models are still men - as are almost all of the Indian-born Silicon Valley CEOs. And their rapid rise is not enough reason to expect more diversity from the industry, experts say. \"Women's representation [in the tech industry] is nowhere close to what it should be,\" Ms Rai says.

            "content": "An interest rate rise in December is hanging in the balance after a Bank of England policymaker said the Omicron coronavirus variant could slow the UK economy. Michael Saunders was one of only two policymakers who voted for a rate hike in November. But he said on Friday that he needed more information before making a decision at the meeting this month. The Bank shocked markets in November after voting to hold the interest rate. It had been widely expected to lift borrowing costs from a record low of 0.1% to combat rising inflation. The Bank did not rule out an increase at the next meeting in December. When pressed on when a rate rise might come, Bank of England governor Andrew Bailey said last month: \"From now onwards.\" However, Mr Saunders said in a speech on Friday: \"At present, given the new Omicron Covid variant has only been detected quite recently, there could be particular advantages in waiting to see more evidence on its possible effects on public health outcomes and hence on the economy.\" Though he said there were also risks from delaying an interest rate rise for too long: \"Continued delay also could be costly.\" Omicron pauses the return to economic normality\nBank of England hints at future interest rate rise While Omicron might slow Britain's economy, Mr Saunders said it could also help push up the cost of living if it led to people spending less on going out and other in-person services and more on goods, when supply chains are already strained. A delay in raising rates could also lead to employers scrambling for staff. \"This could require a more abrupt and painful policy tightening later,\" Mr Saunders said. \"For me, the balance between these considerations is likely to be a key factor at the December meeting.\" Sterling fell against the dollar and the euro after Mr Saunders's comments. Investors were pricing in only a 33% chance of a December rate hike after his speech, down from about 75% last week before news broke of the new variant. The Bank will announce the interest rate decision on 16 December. The Bank of England confounded investor expectations of a rate rise in November when it said it wanted to wait for more data on whether the end of the furlough scheme in October had led to a jump in unemployment. Mr Saunders said the end of the government job support scheme did not appear to have hit to the labour market very hard. He said the rates were likely to rise over the next few quarters, assuming the economy performs as expected. In a question-and-answer session after his speech, the former Citi economist declined to give a steer on his likely decision at this month's meeting. \"I don't want to use code words today to indicate either way as to what my vote at the December meeting might be. There are potential costs and benefits to waiting for more data,\" he said. Mr Saunders and deputy governor Dave Ramsden were the two members of the Bank's nine-strong Monetary Policy Committee who cast votes in early November to raise Bank Rate to 0.25%. However, Mr Bailey said the decision had been a \"close call\". ",

            "header": "Retailers make shocking petrol profit, says RAC",
            "content": "Retailers are continuing to put up fuel prices when they should reduce them in line with savings in wholesale oil prices, the RAC motoring services organisation has claimed. In response to concerns about the Omicron variant, oil prices fell by around $10 a barrel last week. But this reduced wholesale fuel price has not been reflected at the pumps. Retailers added on average another 3.1p to a litre of unleaded petrol and 2.7p to diesel in November. The RAC said this hike in petrol prices was \"completely unjustified\", with larger retailers making a \"shocking\" profit. In particular, the RAC pointed the finger at supermarket chains who are major fuel retailers, such as Asda, Sainsbury's, Tesco and Morrisons, saying they should have reduced prices, but had instead increased them \"unnecessarily\". Why it's the end of the road for petrol stations\nWhat's happening about petrol shortages?\nPetrol prices at eight-year high, says RAC \"Since Covid they've been far more reluctant to pass on any savings, even though the frequency with which they buy means they are in a position to pass on any savings in the wholesale price to drivers far more quickly,\" RAC fuel spokesperson Simon Williams told the BBC. \"It would be much fairer if retailers mirrored wholesale prices more closely on a daily or weekly basis.\" A spokesperson from the British Retail Consortium said: \"Supermarkets are keen to provide their customers with the best value for petrol through their forecourts, offering the cheapest petrol in the country. \"However, prices at the pump will be influenced by various forces, including tax, oil prices and operational costs.\" The RAC has urged the government to intervene and said the chancellor's fuel duty freeze last month is not enough. \"The government should ask the biggest retailers to explain why they're charging such high prices for fuel when wholesale prices have dropped,\" Mr Williams added. A government spokesperson said: \"Fuel prices are increasing in countries across the world and this is not an issue unique to the UK. \"We've provided £4.2bn of support to help people with the cost of living, including effectively cutting taxes for workers on Universal Credit, providing £500m of targeted support for the most vulnerable families and freezing fuel duty for the twelfth year in a row.\" Analysis by the RAC found that despite wholesale costs having fallen by 7p from the middle of the month, retailers continued to put prices up, with the average cost of a litre of unleaded petrol ending the month at 147.28p and diesel up to 150.64p. Prices for both fuels peaked at record highs on 20 November and 21 November respectively - diesel reaching 151.1p per litre and petrol at 147.72p. The key factor affecting petrol is the wholesale oil market, meaning any reduction in the oil price should result in buyers paying less at the pumps. While the price of petrol is linked to the wholesale price of oil, it is competitively driven. That means the cost motorists are charged is not directly linked to crude. Instead, suppliers control the prices they sell petrol at. Mr Williams explained that the current margins big retailers are making have gone up as high as 20p a litre, which is \"unheard of when everyone is driving\". \"Sadly, our data shows all too clearly that drivers are being taken for a ride by retailers at the moment,\" he said. However, on Tuesday, motoring group the AA said that the UK's average petrol prices did begin to show the first \"significant fall\" since November 2020. Having peaked above 54.5p a litre in the second week of November, the petrol cost to retailers was down to 49p at the start of last week and yesterday dropped below 43p a litre. But the RAC said it was not enough of a fall to reflect the plummet in wholesale prices. The AA welcomed the consumer petrol price fall, but criticised the fact it had taken so much longer to drop in relation to falling wholesale prices. Luke Bosdet, the AA's fuel price spokesman said that previously, the market would \"wait until Asda or Morrisons announced a price cut before starting to move\". \"Without that initial kick, pump prices have stagnated, and that is a potentially worrying development if it sets the pattern for the future,\" he said. \"In basic pounds, shillings and pence, if a supermarket makes a big deal about discounts of £2 or £3 off the shopping bill, but grabs back £2 to £3 per tank by not passing on savings at the pump, the consumer needs to factor that in.\" The Petrol Retailers Association (PRA) represents independently-owned forecourts that collectively account for around two thirds of the UK's forecourts. Because its members buy fuel less frequently than larger supermarkets, it told the BBC that reductions in wholesale prices can take some days to filter through to the pump price. \"Electricity prices, business rates, labour costs have all risen and these need to be paid for if your local petrol station is to remain in business,\" said Gordon Balmer, executive director of the PRA. He added that fuel retailers have been hit by the \"double whammy\" of reduced sales and rising costs. \"Our members continually monitor prices to ensure that they remain competitive with their industry counterparts and continue to provide good value for money.\" ",

            "content": "Luxury department store group Selfridges is set to be sold to a Thai conglomerate for up to £4bn. The UK retailer owns 25 outlets, including a huge flagship store in London's Oxford Street, and branches in Dublin, the Netherlands and Canada. Selfridges' owner, the Weston family, agreed sale terms with Central Group in the last few days, according to the Times, which first reported the deal. Selfridges was founded in 1908 by US retail magnate Harry Gordon Selfridge. It has been owned by the billionaire Westons for 18 years. The Weston family put the chain up for sale in June, a few months after the death of Galen Weston, who oversaw the move to take the department store private in 2003. The family control Selfridges through Wittington Investments Ltd, in Canada, which is separate from the UK arm of the same name that owns a large stake in Primark-owner Associated British Foods. Central Group is a family-owned conglomerate that started in Bangkok but went global when the founder's son, Samrit Chirathivat, opened Thailand's first department store in 1956. It now has 3,700 shops around the world, from supermarkets to electronics outlets, and department stores in Europe. Central Group's non-executive director Vittorio Radice ran Selfridges between 1996 and 2003 and has been managing a department store in Italy since 2006. His role includes responsibility for expansion in Europe. A division of the group, Central Retail, sparked confusion about whether a Selfridges sale had fallen through when it issued a short stock exchange announcement that it was \"not currently involved\" with a deal. However, it is understood the Westons, one of Canada's richest families, are in talks with a different arm of the giant Central Group company. It is unclear why the family has decided to sell, although like many retailers the business has suffered during lockdown and the absence of high-end tourists in city centres. The business had sales of almost £2bn in the year to February 2020, but when more recent accounts are published they are likely to show a big fall. Selfridges declined to comment, and Central Group could not be reached. ",

            "header": "Covid: Omicron fears cause wave of hotel cancellations",
            "content": "Fears about the Omicron Covid variant have led to a raft of cancellations at hotels, with many customers changing their Christmas plans. Best Western GB, which runs 300 UK hotels, told the BBC that around three-quarters of its hotels had experienced event and room booking cancellations. Uncertainty over the Omicron variant has added to safety concerns over large gatherings of people. It has also led to the tightening of rules on travel. Jonathan Fletcher, who manages a Best Western hotel in Dorset called The Grange, says customers have been phoning all week cancelling meals and parties. \"This Saturday night, we were supposed to have 100 people eating in our restaurant. Now there'll only be 12,\" he says \"One local business cancelled because they'd been told by head office not to gather in groups larger than 20 people. Overall, 268 people were booked in for Christmas parties this week. Now we're down to 130.\" What are the UK's new travel rules?\nHow are Covid rules and booster jabs changing? Mr Fletcher says people are also cancelling overnight stays. \"We were full for four nights this week, but 35% of our rooms have now been cancelled and we're not receiving bookings to replace them. \"Corporate guests who were coming from abroad have also been cancelling\", he adds He says the cancellations will cost him, and his staff, a lot of money \"We've already placed orders from suppliers, we've spent a fortune on redecorating the hotel for the Christmas season\", he says. \"If this continues, financially, we'd almost be better off in lockdown and having furlough back,\" he adds Cancellations have also been reported by the Arora Group, which is the largest private owner and operator of hotels in the UK. \"It's been a rollercoaster ride,\" said Surinder Arora, the group's founder and chairman. \"Guests who are flying out of the country normally tend to spend a night with us, especially on early morning flights, now a lot of those are being cancelled.\" Earlier this week, the government introduced new rules for travel, with every person entering the UK now required to take a PCR test. There are also signs that bookings beyond Christmas are being affected. The Arora Group said some business customers were considering pulling out of events in the new year. \"We had large corporates who had bookings in January, who are now saying: 'Actually we many want to push it back to later in the year',\" Mr Arora said. But trade body UKHospitality, which represents hotels and B&Bs, said that while members were reporting some cancellations, most bookings are robust. \"Anecdotally, some members are seeing cancellation rates of around 10%, so it seems most people are planning to go ahead.\" Victoria Erasmus owns a rural hotel in Inverness, Scotland called Glen Mhor and her guests are predominantly from the UK. She remains optimistic about the festive period. \"We've haven't had cancellations yet but we've had a few say they are unsure. It's all been last minute bookings so people are waiting to see what's happening this Christmas,\" she said. \"Covid and all the latest variants make it really difficult to plan ahead.\" Best Western's chief executive Tim Rumney has called for clarity on what people should be doing. \"We have had a week of mixed messages about whether people should socialise or not, cancel parties or not and small, independent businesses like our hotels are on the front line feeling the effects of that indecision,\" he said. \"My fear is the damage is already done, and this festive period will need to be written off like last Christmas.\" ",

            "header": "Ride hailing app Grab falls in $40bn market debut",
            "content": "Grab - the Uber of South East Asia - has made its stock market debut on New York's Nasdaq trading platform. Shares initially rose in the Singapore-based operator of the ride-hailing and payments app, before falling sharply. The share sale valued Grab at more than $40bn (£30bn), making it the largest ever US listing by a South East Asian firm. Instead of a conventional share sale, Grab went public using a shell company designed to make the process cheaper. Using a special purpose acquisition company (Spac) has become an increasingly popular strategy with start-ups, as it offers more flexibility around voting rights, as well as lower costs. Minutes into their market debut, the shares rose by 21%, but ended the day more than 20% below their launch value. Grab's business is growing, but the firm is yet to make a profit and it doesn't expect to do so until 2023. However, Grab chief executive Anthony Tan told the BBC the firm's profit margins were \"industry leading\" and that he was focused on growing the business in a cost-disciplined way. \"You look at our food delivery business, a majority of our markets have already broken even, so we know how to get there as a clear path of profitability,\" he said. To address criticism that it is avoiding public scrutiny over its financial performance by choosing a Spac listing, Grab has reported its earnings for the last three quarters even though it didn't need to. The Uber killer that became a financial super-app \"Grab needs to demonstrate to investors its growth potential,\" said Professor Howard Yu of IMD Business school. \"This is why Grab is trying hard to enter finance because that is one sector really high in terms of profitability.\" Grab's existing investors include Japan's Softbank, China's Didi and Uber. The flotation is being seen as a test for South East Asian financial technology and could encourage other start-ups in the region - like Grab's Indonesian rival Gojek which merged with Tokopedia - to follow suit. Less than a decade ago, Grab was a simple taxi company, founded by Anthony Tan and Tan Hooi Ling in Malaysia. Now it is one of the most popular apps in Asia, offering rides, food delivery and now, financial services, including loans, insurance, payments and investments - all accessed through a mobile phone app. In 2018, it pushed Uber out of South East Asia and operates in 465 cities across eight countries. Grab has become a \"powerful flywheel combining ride-hailing, delivery and payments\" that has \"demonstrated durable growth even during the pandemic and is playing a foundational role in the digitisation of South East Asia\", said Brad Gerstner, the chief executive of its Spac partner Altimeter. Spacs, which became a major story in the US stock market at the start of this year, are shell companies that are set up with the sole purpose of merging with a private firm to take it public. They are also known as \"blank cheque companies\". For start-ups like Grab, it is a quicker and cheaper way to list on a stock market, with fewer regulatory hurdles. A conventional initial public offering (IPO) costs about $1m, according to Michael Lints, partner at Golden Gate Ventures. But with a Spac, a company can go public for as little as half that amount. \"From a start-up's perspective, Spac is an extreme arrangement because it is even more founder-friendly than a traditional IPO,\" said Professor Yu. \"Even after the company is listed, the voting rights can be geared to favour the founder and they remain in absolute control.\" Grab is a case in point: Mr Tan has secured 60.4% of the voting rights even though he owns just 2.2% of the company's ordinary shares. This arrangement could have come under scrutiny if Grab had listed in the conventional way. For investors though, Spacs can be more risky and they have not been a mainstream investment instrument until fairly recently. \"They were viewed as a shady way of getting a company listed,\" said Mr Lints. However, when brand name companies like DraftKings, a fantasy sports and betting operator, chose to go public with a Spac in 2019, the market took notice. Thanks to the Covid-19 pandemic, trillions of dollars of economic stimulus have been poured into the global economy, flooding the market with cheap money and investors looking for new opportunities. After a record number of Spac listings in the first three months of this year, however, the US stock market regulator - the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) - issued guidance on Spacs. Its new accounting rules have resulted in the number of Spac IPOs falling sharply. \"Investors started to realise that some of them weren't even generating revenues,\" said Mr Lints, adding that there are signs people remain more cautious about Spacs. But as the regulatory filing backlog clears, Spacs are making a comeback. Spac mergers of WeWork, social networking app Nextdoor and Grab have all been approved in the last few months. The explosive growth of Spacs in the US is also spreading to the rest of the world, with the stock exchanges in London and Singapore allowing them and Hong Kong considering it. \"With a lot of appetite to invest, other countries are trying to relax regulations to encourage Spac listings so that they can bring these high-flying tech companies to list in their local markets,\" said Prof Yu. \"It's almost like a race to the bottom, just like the taxation regime.\" ",

            "content": "Mining giant Anglo American intends to introduce mandatory Covid vaccinations across the company and may sack workers who refuse. The firm, which employs 95,000 people worldwide, says it is consulting with its staff about the policy. The Daily Telegraph, citing an internal Anglo American document, reported that workers who refuse to be vaccinated could be fired \"as a last resort\". This would happen if an alternative, remote working role could not be found. A spokesman for Anglo American told the BBC: \"Anglo American is intending to introduce a policy that requires Covid-19 vaccination for access to all its sites and offices, with the continued objective of protecting our employees, their families, and communities as much as we can.\" It said that over the past 18 months, it had encouraged workers to be vaccinated and had set up vaccination facilities at some sites. This includes in southern Africa where Anglo American has a large presence and where the new Covid variant, Omicrom, was first detected last week. \"Requiring vaccination for access is the next step, given that vaccination is the best defence available,\" the company said. However, it admitted that implementing a mandatory Covid vaccination policy may vary in different countries. \"We expect there may be differences in exactly how and when the policy will be implemented across the group due to local contexts and legal requirements,\" said a spokesman. Anglo American employs about 1,300 workers at the Woodsmith mine project in North Yorkshire, which it acquired when it bought Sirius Minerals last year. It also has its headquarters in London. Beth Hale, partner and general counsel at CM Murray, which specialises in employment law, said making vaccines mandatory is \"difficult to do lawfully in the UK\" for a business. She questioned whether it would be \"a proportionate way or ensuring health and safety in the workplace\" when there are other measures that businesses can take, such as asking workers to take a lateral flow test or requiring social distancing in the office. Ms Hale also said it would be difficult to fire someone for not being vaccinated against Covid. As well as raising the issue of discrimination, she said: \"There are issues around indirect discrimination against groups who are less likely to be vaccinated.\" In November, Health Secretary Sajid Javid ruled out mandatory Covid vaccinations for everyone in the UK, saying it was something the government \"won't ever look at\". However, he said that it would be compulsory for frontline NHS staff in England to be fully vaccinated against Covid. Care home staff in England are required to be fully vaccinated Northern Ireland is consulting on a similar move for frontline NHS staff. Scotland and Wales have not made any proposals to make Covid jabs compulsory for NHS workers or care home staff. However, other countries such as Austria want to enforce vaccinations from February next year while Germany announced on Thursday its Parliament would vote on whether to make vaccination mandatory. This week European Commission president Ursula von der Leyen said European Union countries should consider mandatory vaccination to combat Covid and the Omicron variant. She said: \"How we can encourage and potentially think about mandatory vaccination within the European Union? This needs discussion. This needs a common approach, but it is a discussion that I think has to be led.\" The Daily Telegraph reports that Anglo American workers could be exempted from the vaccination policy on medical grounds. The internal Anglo American document quoted by the newspaper also states that staff would be \"given a reasonable amount of time to get vaccinated prior to any consequences being imposed\". ",

            "content": "A number of big businesses are holding smaller Christmas parties within departments, rather than larger, company-wide events. Uncertainty over the Omicron Covid variant has added to safety concerns over large gatherings. Several companies, including NatWest, Aviva and Deloitte are hosting smaller team-based parties, and said attendance at any event will be a personal choice. Events businesses said they hoped for big parties to help them recoup losses. Consultancy firms PwC, EY and KPMG also confirmed that firm-wide events were not planned, but smaller teams could make plans among themselves. \"We won't be holding a large firm-wide Christmas party for our people in the UK this year, but teams will be able to have smaller celebrations,\" EY said. How are Covid rules and booster jabs changing?\nWhat are England's mask rules now? Meanwhile, KPMG said in light of the new Covid variant, team gatherings could \"still take place but we are stressing that this is only if our people feel comfortable doing\". About 52% of UK workplaces have decided not to hold a Christmas office party, according to a survey of 2,000 office workers commissioned by Covid testing company Prenetics. The government has said there is no need to cancel Christmas parties despite the emergence of the Omicron coronavirus variant, with people urged to get a booster vaccine. However, NHS Providers said some NHS trusts have asked staff \"not to mix in big groups\" in the run-up to Christmas. Plextek Services Ltd, an engineering services business based in Great Chesterford, told the BBC it had postponed its office Christmas party from 10 December to 25 February. Chief executive Brent Hudson said some of its 80-strong workforce were \"becoming worried\" about the new variant, so the postponement made sense because Plextek wanted to have \"as well-attended an event as possible\". \"The venue said that if we postponed any closer to 10 December than now, we would be liable for the full cost,\" he added. \"We felt there is a reasonable chance the government will ban such gatherings between now and 10 December and are unwilling to write off the cost.\" Sir Martin Sorrell, executive chairman of the advertising agency S4 Capital, said that among its clients there has been \"a sharp series of cancellations since this [Omicron] happened just three, four, five days ago\". \"The uncertainty is extreme,\" he told the BBC's Today programme. \"And government policy - understandably, to be a little bit sympathetic to the government, it is an extremely difficult situation - but we have been through this before with Delta and the previous variants so you would have thought the government would be a little bit more prepared for what may or may not happen in terms of scenarios and planning.\" NatWest, which employs nearly 60,000 full-time staff, has urged employees to take a lateral flow test before attending team events. Insurance firm Aviva has also asked staff to take a Covid test on the morning of their Christmas parties, which are understood to be taking place within teams. The company also advised people to \"wear face coverings as appropriate\". Covid: Is an office Christmas party too risky?\n'We’ve had 20 cancellations in one weekend'\nNo need to cancel Christmas party plans - Javid Rosie McInerney, people and talent lead at broadband provider Cuckoo, said there was \"so much value in all getting together as a business,\" adding: \"There's only so much that Zoom and Google Meet can do for you.\" Alisa Mistry, HR advice manager at CharlieHR, said the 3,000 businesses the company it works with were not looking to cancel their Christmas parties, but were asking for \"guidance on how they can keep everyone safe\". Matthew Dibley, owner and manager of Bang and Olufsen in Exeter, is taking his six staff on a four-day Christmas holiday to Lanzarote. Mr Dibley told the BBC he decided on the trip, from 16 December to 19 December, to reward his staff for their hard work over a \"rough couple of years\". \"We like to treat our staff well and pay them well,\" he said. \"It's not something we would normally do.\" However, Mr Dibley said he and his team are worried whether concerns over the new Omicron variant will lead to more international travel restrictions. \"We just think this will be typical if we are not allowed to go,\" he added. \"We are hoping we can still go.\" Business Minister George Freeman said: \"For many small businesses who have four or five staff who work together every day anyway gathering to have a drink is not a big risk, but some companies might normally bring hundreds of people in from around the world and they, this year, may decide is that sensible, given the pandemic and where we are. \"In the end I think businesses know how to make those decisions.\" The emergence of the new Covid strain has not led to restrictions being placed on hospitality, but businesses say customer confidence in eating and drinking out has taken a hit, with a flurry of cancellations ahead of the sector's main money-making period of the year. Michael Kill, chief executive of the Night Time Industries Association, told the BBC he would have \"absolutely loved\" to have seen the return of the Christmas party this year, but bookings had \"stalled\" since the emergence of the Omicron variant. He said a number of event companies had also reported cancellations in recent days. \"The government needs to recognise that, while restrictions are not in place for the hospitality and night time economy sectors, we are reliving the moments of March 2020 where the prime minister asked people not to go to pubs, bars, clubs and theatres,\" Mr Kill added. Design My Night, a digital platform which allows people to make bookings at restaurants, bars and pubs, said it had seen a spike in people cancelling bookings scheduled during December. The company said that after the government announced masks would be mandatory in shops in England again last week, cancellations increased 14%, compared to the week before. Hospitality has been one of the hardest hit industries by the coronavirus pandemic, with pubs, hotels and eateries having to close during three lockdowns. \"The chilling talk of Plan B is already being felt across hospitality as bookings are cancelled and plans changed,\" said Kate Nicholls, chief executive of industry body UK Hospitality. \"There is no doubt that this will have a damaging effect on businesses, just as they head into their key trading period.\" ",

The charity, which campaigns for warm, dry homes, used industry data and forecasts to predict that the typical gas bill, for those on standard tariffs, is likely to have gone up from £466 a year in October 2020, to £944 in April 2022. Catherine Geddes, who lives on her own in Keighley, is also struggling to cover her energy costs and was worried about the likelihood of them continuing to rise sharply. She has found unusual ways to try to keep the cost down. \"I very rarely put the heating on. Basically I wrap myself up in a blanket and I will use the hairdryer to warm me up. \"My anxiety levels are so high. It is just a nightmare.\" National Energy Action information on help with energy bills Most households pay for their gas and electricity together in a dual-fuel deal. Those who pay a standard tariff are protected by the industry regulator Ofgem's price cap. This was set at its lowest level in October 2020, owing to relatively low wholesale prices faced by suppliers. It meant the typical annual domestic energy bill for millions of households was no higher than £1,042 a year. However, it has increased twice since then, most recently its biggest increase to date this October, which meant those on standard tariffs, with typical household levels of energy use, saw an increase of £139 to £1,277 a year. There is widespread expectation that owing to soaring wholesale gas prices in recent months the next price cap in April will be set at a much higher level than now. National Energy Action has predicted that this is likely to be a £550 a year increase for a typical standard tariff dual fuel customer. \"The cost of living in the UK is at its highest level in a decade with household energy bills the biggest driver. When the costs of essential services go up, those on lowest incomes get hit hardest,\" said Adam Scorer, the charity's chief executive. \"For people already on a budgetary knife-edge, the cost of keeping a family warm has exploded while budgets have collapsed. No amount of useful tips or savvy shopping can cope with that.\" The existence of the price cap has delayed the impact of surging wholesale prices on household bills. However, it has also been blamed as creating an unmanageable market by some of the smaller energy firms which have collapsed during the current crisis. Their customers have been moved onto tariffs with other suppliers, in line with the price cap. As a result, hundreds of thousands of people who might have expected to be protected from price rises as they were on a fixed rate will now also be hit by the April price rise. In October, Ofgem chief executive Jonathan Brearley told the BBC that the price cap was there to stop firms making unfair profits, but \"legitimate costs have to be passed through\". He said it was too early to say how much the rise in April would be or whether Ofgem would have to review the price cap more frequently in future. Energy UK, which represents the industry, has said that anyone who is struggling to pay for their energy bill should call their supplier for support. \"Suppliers have put forward more support for customers who might be struggling with their bills this year, and we are currently working with consumer groups to help raise awareness of the help that is available,\" said Emma Pinchbeck, Energy UK's chief executive.

            "content": "Plans to allow one million more passengers through the UK's fifth busiest airport have been approved by councillors. London Luton Airport would be able to handle 19 million people a year, up from 18 million, the local council, which owns the airport, said. Amendments to the current noise contours were also approved. Opponents said the airport was already failing to meet conditions and this would mean even more flights and noise. Earlier this year, the council's company London Luton Airport Ltd, which owns the airport, became Luton Rising to avoid confusion with London Luton Airport Operations Ltd, a separate private consortium which runs the airport day to day. Luton Borough Council said the planning application had come from the airport operator following a consultation and not Luton Rising, and the council's development management committee had granted planning permission \"subject to conditions and a legal agreement\". The decision had taken into account the authority's \"local plan and national planning policy and guidance, and other material considerations\", it added. The authority also said the application did not affect [Luton Rising's] long term proposals to increase capacity of the airport to 32 million per year, which would be determined by government, not the council. Council loans airport a further £119m\nLuton Airport delays plans for second terminal\nAirport 'could take years to recover' The council also approved amendments to the current noise contours, which measure how many people are affected by noise from the airport. Bill Sellicks, from Hitchin Forum, told the meeting the group's members often walked or cycled in the area to the east of the airport's runway and were concerned about the noise impact. He had urged the committee to reject the plans, saying it would \"expose more people to dangerous levels of noise and would result in increased carbon emissions\". Groups including Harpenden Sky, St Albans Aircraft Noise Defence (Stand), Harpenden Society and St Albans Quieter Skies (STAQS) also opposed the plans. Stop Low Flights from Luton said: \"People living in this area accept there is an airport nearby but we don't accept that the airport has carte blanche to disregard its planning conditions and impose an increase in noise burden on our communities.\" Jane Timmis, Conservative Dacorum Borough councillor for Watling ward, said there was no need for the airport to expand further \"especially in light of recent pandemic and catastrophic climate change effects\". She said there should not be an expansion to the \"detriment of not only Luton residents but also to a large number of Hertfordshire residents\".

            "content": "Walt Disney has elected a woman to chair its board for the first time in the entertainment giant's 98-year history. Susan Arnold, who has been a Disney board member for 14 years, will succeed Bob Iger at the end of this year. She was formerly an executive at global investment firm Carlyle. Mr Iger, who stepped down as Disney's chief executive in 2020 after 15 years in the role, will leave the company by the end of this month. \"As I step into this new role as chairman of the board, I look forward to continuing to serve the long-term interests of Disney's shareholders and working closely with CEO Bob Chapek as he builds upon the company's century-long legacy of creative excellence and innovation,\" Ms Arnold said in a statement. She has also served in senior roles at some of America's biggest companies. For the last eight years Ms Arnold has been an executive at Carlyle Group, having previously held roles at consumer goods giant Procter and Gamble and fast food chain McDonald's. \"Susan is an incredibly esteemed executive whose wealth of experience, unwavering integrity, and expert judgment have been invaluable to the company since she first joined the Board in 2007,\" Mr Iger said. Her appointment comes as large companies are moving away from management structures where the chief executive and chairperson roles are held by the same person after pressure from corporate governance experts, investors and, in some cases, regulators to separate the two key positions. Mr Iger's exit marks the end of an era for Disney, who has been in a senior role at the company since 1996. In his time as chief executive Disney made a number of major acquisitions, including the takeovers of Pixar, Marvel, Lucasfilm and 21st Century Fox. In 2016, the firm opened its first theme park and resort in mainland China. Several other Disney executives have announced plans to leave by the end of this year, including studios head Alan Horn, president and chief creative officer of Disney Branded Television Gary Marsh and company general counsel Alan Braverman.

Witnesses called to appear include Coinbase's Alesia Haas, Circle's Jeremy Allaire and Bitfury's Brian Brooks. It will be the first time companies representing the controversial sector have been questioned in this way. US politicians across the political spectrum have called for more scrutiny of crypto-currencies. Elizabeth Warren on the left of the Democratic Party has called for tougher regulation of the sector and Donald Trump has described crypto-currencies as \"a scam\". Mr Brooks of Bitfury previously served as a top banking regulator under the Trump administration and had a role in policy-making around crypto-currencies. Indian government set to ban crypto-currencies\nEl Salvador plans Bitcoin city at base of volcano\nNew York's next mayor wants to be paid in Bitcoin Crypto-currencies are not currencies in the traditional sense, although they can sometimes be used to make payments. They are stored online in a \"digital wallet\" and act more like investment vehicles or securities, often with a high degree of volatility. The anonymity of paying using crypto-currencies means they have been favoured for criminal activities such as drug dealing and ransomware attacks. However their supporters say the view that they are predominantly for circumventing the law is outdated and that innovation in this area offers huge potential. Countries around the world have taken radically different approaches to crypto-currencies. China has declared crypto-currency transactions illegal, a move India looks set to follow. Many other central banks are eyeing the sector warily and discussing regulation. However El Salvador recently declared Bitcoin - the most widely established crypto-currency - to be legal tender and its president plans to build a Bitcoin city at the base of a volcano, with the cryptocurrency used to fund the project. Across the US, as well as many private citizens holding crypto-currencies, states and municipalities have begun toying with plans to integrate them into their operations. The mayor of Miami and mayor elect of New York have ambitions to make their cities centres for cryptocurrency business. The hearing before the US House Financial Services Committee will focus on \"the challenges and benefits of financial innovation\", according to the committee announcement. The other chief executives who have been asked to appear are Sam Bankman-Fried of FTX Trading, Chad Cascarilla of Paxos and Dennelle Dixon of the Stellar Development Foundation. ",

            "content": "Christmas is usually the busiest time of year for shops, pubs and restaurants. With uncertainty over a new Covid variant, we asked businesses how they will cope if more restrictions are introduced over the next few weeks. On Tuesday the government reintroduced mandatory face coverings in shops and on public transport, but hospitality is currently exempt. Business owners in Whittlesey and Peterborough, in Cambridgeshire, and Ipswich say they are reliant on a good Christmas trade but fear worries over the Omicron variant and the possibility of more restrictions is keeping customers away. Haylea Armstrong owns the Little House of Fragrance in Whittlesey and says there are fewer people coming into the store. \"It has been quieter since Tuesday and for the last few weeks, it's not as busy as expected this time of year,\" she said. \"It's our most important and busiest time. Online is definitely busier, people are still preferring to shop online.\" Ms Armstrong says she is happy to see face coverings being brought back but would feel uncomfortable asking customers about why they are not wearing one. \"I think we need to do it to keep everyone safe and keep shops open and trading as normal,\" she said. \"It's really tricky, I would feel uncomfortable asking them to wear one.\" In Ipswich, Julien Jourdain is hoping to have 6,000 people in his restaurants the Bistro on the Quay and Mariners Restaurant over the next three weeks, with lots of Christmas parties booked. \"It's very, very important the Christmas parties go ahead this year,\" he said. \"We very much depend on that to save countless jobs and to bounce back from the lockdowns and Covid.\" He said he was slightly worried about cancellations - this Saturday a table of 25 had cancelled over Covid cases within the party. And if a new lockdown is imposed, he worries it could lead to job losses and financial struggles. For now, though, he is trying to stay positive and says he is operating in a safe way to protect staff and diners. \"Obviously [the uncertainty] is very, very worrying. We just need the big parties to make Christmas happen,\" he said. \"I think its very, very safe to come out - we've got social distancing, masks, gel and also cases not that much and everyone is jabbed. I think it's safe to come out for parties and having a good time.\" Will shortages and rising costs affect Christmas?\n'We’ve had 20 cancellations in one weekend'\nEngland face mask rules return over variant fears House of Feasts in Peterborough has had 20 cancellations since the weekend, and says these were due to worries over Covid and the new variant. Adam Gienza, the restaurant's general manager, said: \"Our reservations have dropped massively - 48 that was the biggest number cancelled. \"People are afraid and don't know what will happen - another lockdown? Restrictions? Because we don't know what Omicron is. \"It's challenging because when we have a big party we need to shut the restaurant and today we have already ordered the lamb, potatoes, turkeys - and we can't cancel that. \"So we need to try and do something else to not lose money.\" Amanda Fisher runs the Swan and Hedgehog pub in Ipswich, and two other establishments, and says she needs a great Christmas or she may be faced with having to consider closing some of her sites. \"We're all sitting on the fence not knowing what is going to be able to be done and not,\" she said. With the Omicron variant prompting the reintroduction of masks in other settings, Ms Fisher says safety has to come first but she worries for the future of hospitality. \"You think 'oh no it's something else we've got to deal with' and you understand that everyone has got to feel safe and be safe. \"But hospitality has been hit so hard this year, it just makes you worry for your future.\" She has already got fewer bookings for Christmas than in the past and says it is essential that hospitality can be open over the festive season. \"We didn't have debt prior to Covid but we've all got 'bounce back' loans, we're all behind on payments of certain things with being closed for so long,\" she said. \"It would be amazing [to stay open] but also you know you've got to keep people safe and they've got to feel comfortable to come into the pub. \"It's awful we've struggled through the summer with a lack of staff, regulations we keep trying and trying and unless we see a light at the end of the tunnel I don't know what we'll do.\" Find BBC News: East of England on Facebook, Instagram and Twitter.

            "content": "The US economy is in a strong position, President Joe Biden has said, thanks to action taken by the government to free up supply chain blockages and tackle the rising cost of living. He predicted that prices, which have been rising sharply, would ease. The president said policies to tackle bottlenecks at ports and lower the price of fuel were working. \"We're heading into a holiday season on very strong shape,\" he said. \"It's not because of luck,\" Asked how supply chains would weather disruption from the new variant of coronavirus, President Biden said he was an \"optimist\", but that it was too soon to know what the impact might be. As a result of the economic recovery a typical American family was now better off than before the pandemic struck, the president said, describing a 40% reduction in child poverty as \"a moral victory\". Inflation uncertainty has risen, Fed chair warns\nFact-checking Biden's claims about the US economy\nCan the US deal with a shortage of 80,000 truckers? \"Americans on average have about $100 (£75.33) more in their pockets every month than they did last year [and] about $350 more each month than they did before the pandemic, even after accounting for inflation,\" the president said. Since taking office, the Biden administration has pumped billions of dollars of stimulus into the US economy, including direct cheques to households and tax breaks. Economic growth has rebounded as the impact of the pandemic began to ease, and after shrinking 30% in the first six months of 2020, the economy is now back at the size it was pre-pandemic. However, higher demand for goods, and on-going disruptions to the supply and delivery of those goods, has helped push inflation up to 6.2% - the highest it has been for 31 years. \"I've used every tool available to address the price increases,\" President Biden said. Releasing part of the US's oil reserves last month, in an action coordinated with several other nations, to try to bring down the price of fuel had been \"making a difference\", he added. Independent economic analysis indicated his Build Back Better bill would reduce inflationary pressures, he stressed. The bill was fully paid for, and would contribute to deficit reduction, by \"making the largest corporations and the richest Americans pay a little more in taxes\". The $1.9tn (£1.4tn) Build Back Better bill, which includes social and climate spending, still needs to be voted on in the US Senate. Asked why he believed he would be able to bring down inflation when previous administrations in the 1970s and 1980s failed, the president said: \"This is the first time I've seen labour and business so ready to cooperate. \"People are in a different state of mind than in the Carter and Nixon years.\" Earlier this week, President Biden hosted the chief executives of several of the countries' largest manufacturers and retailers, including Walmart and CVS Health, Mattel and Best Buy. The executives reported that their inventories were up and shelves well-stocked, ready to meet the consumer demand for the holidays, he said. Biden said the administration had \"broken up log jams\" in the supply chain through various methods, such as by encouraging port operators to work longer hours. He also pointed to the easing of rules over truck drivers' hours. The measures were working, he said, with the number of containers left sitting on docks for over eight days down by 40%. Michael Pearce, US economist at Capital Economics, thinks the president was right to suggest that some of the stresses on the economy were starting to ease, but that all the problems wouldn't go away overnight. \"It's still the case that there are very severe supply problems. Even if they're starting to fade, it'll take some time for that to work its way through, especially now that inventory for a lot of goods is so lean,\" he told the BBC. Inflation which remained would therefore persist well into next year, he said, in part thanks to the trillions of dollars pumped into the economy through the pandemic. The Omicron variant, and expectations that it will hurt economic growth, were probably having a greater impact on the price of fuel, than the move to release oil reserves, Mr Pearce added. Diane Swonk, chief economist at Grant Thornton, thinks Mr Biden's Build Back Better bill could have a pro-inflationary impact in the short term unless it was tweaked further by lawmakers. She felt Omicron, the easing of supply chain problems, and a reduction in government stimulus over the coming months would \"take the steam out of inflation but it won't cool it down enough\". \"The risk is until we can really wrestle the virus to its knees we'll continue to see disruption, even as demand starts to slow again,\" said Ms Swonk. \"We're starting to see more broader based inflation that likely will linger longer.\" ",

            "content": "US online dating giant Match Group has agreed to pay the founders of Tinder $441m (£331.4m) to settle a legal battle over the dating app's worth. Tinder's founders first sued Match and its former owner IAC in August 2018, claiming they had undervalued the app to avoid paying billions of dollars. When Match and media giant IAC bought the founders out in 2017, the firm was valued at $3bn. But Tinder's founders claim it was really worth $13bn at the time. The case has been on trial since mid-November at the New York Supreme Court. Match Group's shares dropped 2% on the news to $127.93. Tinder's founders sue dating app owners\nTinder tweak warns: 'Think before sending abuse' Match Group, which also owns Match.com, OKCupid, Hinge, Meetic, PlentyOfFish, Ship and OurTime, is worth $36.6bn today. The plaintiffs, consisting of 10 current and former top staff including Sean Rad, Justin Mateen and Jonathan Badeen, were given stock options in Tinder as part of their compensation in 2014. But because Tinder is a private company, they were not allowed to cash in their stock options and sell shares on the open market. Their total stake, equivalent to a fifth of Tinder, could only be sold to Match and IAC on specific dates, when the stock options would be independently valued. The lawsuit claims that when Tinder was sold to Match and IAC, the firms merged Tinder into Match without the consent of Tinder's board of directors and cancelled future dates for when options could be exercised. Match and IAC paid the plaintiffs $600m at the time, equivalent to Tinder being valued at $3bn. The plaintiffs said they had been forced to accept the $3bn valuation and were seeking at least $2bn in damages. However, the lawyers for Match and IAC argued that Mr Rad was suffering from \"seller's remorse\" and had not taken the opportunity to argue that Tinder was worth more than $3bn when it was being valued in 2017. Match Group's filing with the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) on Wednesday declared that the firm intends to pay the settlement using cash on hand. ",

Mask rules were brought back in on Tuesday after concerns about the Omicron coronavirus variant. Supermarkets are taking a light touch approach with Tesco, Aldi, Lidl and Iceland not challenging customers. Industry body The British Retail Consortium said it is up to police to enforce face mask rules, not retailers. Co-op policy director Paul Gerrard told Radio 5 Live that while Co-op would put up signs to remind people to wear masks, staff would not refuse to serve customers who were not wearing one. \"We have seen throughout the pandemic that the enforcement of social distancing rules has been a flashpoint for enormous levels of violence and abuse against my colleagues, and we will not put our colleagues at risk,\" he said. There was a rise in violence towards shop workers before the pandemic, and that rise has continued, he said. \"It's not just the frequency, it's the violence and the seriousness of it,\" Mr Gerrard said. \"Every day, in the 2,600 Co-op shops, ten of my colleagues will be physically attacked.\" \"Five of them will be attacked with a weapon - it could be a syringe, it could be a knife, it could be a hammer - and that's not unusual to the Co-op.\" Tesco will just be putting signs up to remind customers about face mask rules, the BBC understands.

Morrisons is expected to have staff checking face mask wearing at the front of the shops, and hand out masks to customers that have forgotten them. Asda has also said it will hand out masks to customers who have forgotten to bring them. Iceland boss Richard Walker told the BBC's Radio Four Today programme on Tuesday that it supported the reintroduction of face masks, but said it would be unfair to ask staff to confront people not wearing masks. \"They are already working under significant pressure, especially as we hit the busiest trading month of the year.\" \"I won't be putting my staff at any risk of confrontation or abuse,\" he said. Mr Walker said in the first lockdown from March to May last year, incidents of verbal abuse dropped from more than 50 incidents a week to five a week after staff were told not to challenge customers. From Tuesday, in England face coverings must now be worn in shops, shopping centres, in transport hubs and on public transport, according to government guidance. There are different rules in Northern Ireland, Scotland and Wales, but they are broadly similar. In England, the Department for Transport said people should wear face coverings in \"crowded and enclosed areas where you come into contact with people you do not usually meet\". People who don't wear masks on public transport can get fined £200 and upwards, it tweeted. The National Police Chiefs' Council says police forces will \"continue to enforce coronavirus regulations where it is necessary to do so\" and will support transport and retail staff in ensuring people wear face coverings. Assistant Chief Constable Owen Weatherill says officers will respond to incidents where \"individuals are violent or abusive towards staff or members of the public\" and will be more visible in towns and shopping centres. The BRC said in February this year that one retailer had reported that when reminding customers to shop alone, they were confronted and shouted at by an individual, who returned to the store later that afternoon \"brandishing an axe [and] … threatening the store team with it\". A shopworker at another retailer asked a couple to put on face coverings. They left the store, only to return hours later when they began \"coughing on staff, insisting they had coronavirus, which made the staff feel distressed.\" Another said staff had been \"threatened with a syringe… [because a shoplifter] was stealing cheese and said if I didn't get out of the way he would stab me.\" Incidents of physical violence increased by two thirds at the time, the BRC said, with flashpoints mainly being around coronavirus rules.

            "header": "Shops step in to supply cash as ATMs close",
            "content": "A scheme which allows shoppers at convenience stores to get cashback without having to make a purchase is being expanded rapidly over the next few weeks. Having started as a small trial, it is now available in 900 stores, and will soon be used in 2,000 shops. Shops are increasingly stepping in to provide cash to customers as ATMs close across the UK. But one retail group says shopkeepers should not be a substitute for ATMs. Average cash withdrawal climbs to £80\nShoppers start to use £100 contactless card limit The system operates through a PayPoint network in local stores, and is backed by Link, which oversees the UK's cash machine network. People using the service can choose to withdraw any amount between 1p and £50, rather than just the notes dispensed by an ATM. They do not have to buy anything in the shop to receive the money, and are not charged a fee. During the year-long trial, more than 24,800 transactions have been made, with an average withdrawal of £27.81. The requirement for the service is the result of disappearing free-to-use ATMs, particularly in less populated areas. There was a 25% drop in the number of free-to-use cash machines between January 2018 and October this year. Link's own figures suggested that while some wealthier parts of Edinburgh and London saw a sharp fall in demand for cash machines, there remained a greater reliance on cash in areas such as Liverpool, Bradford and Birmingham. Retailers receive a fee from the cardholder's bank each time the cashback service is used, and groups representing shopkeepers have given a guarded welcome to its expansion. \"Alternative ways of providing cash are essential, which is why we welcome the extension,\" said Tom Ironside, director of business and regulation at the British Retail Consortium. \"Nonetheless, the provision of cashback is not suitable for all retailers as it often requires them to hold significantly more cash than normal - putting them at an increased crime risk. For this reason, the availability of free-to-use ATMs in all parts of the country remains essential.\" Martin McTague, from the Federation of Small Businesses, said: \"There's been good anecdotal evidence from this cashback without purchase trial, especially with regards to footfall - shoppers come in to take out cash, and then make unplanned purchases when on site, leading them to build a new relationship with a small business. \"Making the wider roll-out a success depends on getting incentives right.\" He said the payments to shopkeepers needed to cover bank fees, which have been ramped up as bank branches have closed, higher insurance premiums owing to having cash on site, and compensation for the time needed to take notes and coins to and from access points. The government has also given its backing to cashback projects, having changed legislation following the UK's departure from the EU to allow it to happen. The trials, and subsequent extension of the scheme, is part of a wider project trying to ensure notes and coins are accessible to everyone who needs them across the UK. The latest Financial Lives survey from the Financial Conduct Authority (FCA) showed that more than five million people rely on cash every day. In July, the FCA, which regulates financial firms, warned that people living in rural areas were having to travel further to find somewhere to withdraw and deposit cash free of charge. The Age UK charity has said that people require the same guarantee of access to cash as they do for running water, electricity and the post. ",

            "header": "'My late mother's belongings were stuck in customs'",
            "content": "When Joanna Harry bought a property in Spain, she wanted to make it a place of her own. So, in early September, the 56-year-old packaged up various belongings - ranging from towels and bedding to some quirky decor - to send to the place where she may one day retire. The six parcels included some vintage items that belonged to her late mother, and held special sentimental value. The packages never arrived. Three ended up being returned to her South Wales home. Three were stuck at customs. \"It has been a bit of a nightmare,\" Mrs Harry said. \"There have been constant emails, no support, and the language barrier has made things difficult. \"These are possessions I love and would like back.\" Since the UK left the EU, new rules have applied to items being sent to the EU. Apart from letters, postcards and documents, anything being sent to the EU requires customs declarations forms to be attached. These are either CN22 or CN23 forms, depending on the value of the items. People sending from Northern Ireland do not need these forms. The recipient may then have to pay customs or VAT charges and a handling fee in the receiving country before they can claim the parcel, although low-value gifts (under €45, or £38) are generally free from VAT or charges. Mrs Harry used a postal service, Parcelhero, to ensure all the forms were completed, printed and attached to her parcels. Since the consumer group Which? got involved in her case, the Spanish postal service ADT Postale has said the parcels are being returned to the UK. Meanwhile, a ParcelHero spokesman told Which? that it was working to return the parcels to Mrs Harry. It has subsequently given Joanna £25 credit as an apology. A Parcelforce Worldwide spokesman said: 'We are currently experiencing delays to some items being delivered in Spain. Items are leaving the UK on time but are subject to some delay when being processed through Spanish customs. \"To avoid items being held at customs, please ensure you are providing complete and accurate electronic customs data and customs documentation (CN22/23).\" 'I was asked to pay an extra £82 for my £200 coat'\nEU firms stop UK deliveries over Brexit tax change In a survey of 1,000 Which? members, 51% of those asked who were planning to send a gift to someone in the EU said they did not know anything at all about the rules which came into force at the start of the year. Which? said that people sending Christmas gifts to the EU needed to be aware of the requirements. Also, under the rules, anyone in the UK receiving a gift from the EU worth more than £39 may face a bill for import VAT - with many items charged at 20%. For goods costing more than £135, customs duties may also apply, which can range from 0% to 25% of the product if they have not been paid by the sender already. The extra charges are usually collected by the courier on behalf of the government, with customers asked to pay before they can pick up their package. The courier may also charge a handling fee of its own. When the UK was part of the European Union's customs union, goods could move freely between the country and other member states without import taxes being charged. EU retailers sending packages to the UK need to fill out customs declaration forms. Shoppers may also have to pay customs or VAT charges, depending on the value of the product and where it came from. That created surprise for a number of shoppers at the start of the year, and could be a risk again during the festive season. UK consumers' rights when buying online, or receiving gifts, from the EU are now more complicated and could lead to disputes. VAT, customs duties and handling fees may all need to be paid. They could be applied before delivery. Many people may find they need to visit the post office to pay all the relevant charges before the item is released\nUnder the Consumer Rights Act, online shoppers have 14 days to return an unwanted item, but they may find it costs them money to send it back\nDisputes are likely to arise if buyers think the extra charges are a \"hidden cost\" that they were unaware of, and feel they should not pay. Now the UK has left the EU, this dispute can no longer be settled in UK courts. It falls under the jurisdiction of the country where the seller is located\nTo avoid losing UK consumers' trade, some overseas sellers in other parts of the world have introduced a rebate scheme to refund some of the charges post-delivery\nMeanwhile, any parcels or gifts sent from England, Wales or Scotland to the EU must have one of a variety of customs forms stuck to it ",

            "content": "The emergence of Omicron raises the uncertainty around inflation, the chair of the Federal Reserve has warned. Rising rates of Covid, plus the new variant, pose new risks to the US economy, Jerome Powell told a Congressional committee. In the past Mr Powell has called recent high rates of inflation transitory, a term he said should now be \"retired\". He also said the Fed should consider tapering its bond-buying stimulus more quickly. During the course of the pandemic the Federal Reserve has been praised for warding off recession with its asset purchasing programme. This month it began the process of reducing that support, the first step towards increasing the cost of borrowing, the usual policy strategy to tame inflation. However a debate has arisen over whether the support should be withdrawn more rapidly. US prices rising at fastest rate for three decades Some economists argue that faster tapering, and an earlier move to higher interest rates, are needed to tackle prices which are rising at their fastest pace for 30 years. Mr Powell has argued that higher prices are the result of pandemic disruption, including to supply chains, and swings in consumer demand. He predicted inflation would fade as the pandemic eased. However, the emergence of Omicron has shaken global markets, raising the prospect that restrictions on travel, social and economic activity could be extended further. \"The recent rise in Covid-19 cases and the emergence of the Omicron variant pose downside risks to employment and economic activity and increased uncertainty for inflation,\" Mr Powell told the Senate banking committee. \"Greater concerns about the virus could reduce people's willingness to work in person, which would slow progress in the labour market and intensify supply-chain disruptions,\" he added. When asked about his view of whether inflation could still be described as transitory, Mr Powell said: \"It is probably a good time to retire that word, and explain more clearly what we mean.\" He said he believed that high inflation would persist until the middle of next year, and so the central bank is \"likely\" to discuss speeding up the tapering of its asset-buying programme. The markets have interpreted the statements as a change of tone from the Federal Reserve chair, indicating a shift towards a tighter monetary policy. \"We've long maintained that the Fed is the ultimate owner of the 'transitory' characterisation and the chair's decision to move beyond that is a decidedly hawkish step,\" said Ian Lyngen at BMO Capital Markets.

            "header": "Omicron pauses the return to economic normality",
            "content": "The science may still be uncertain but the Omicron variant has definitively intruded upon recent stock market euphoria. The designation as a variant of concern last week, and then further comments this morning from vaccine makers that existing vaccines will not be as effective, has caused widespread and significant falls in share prices. So what will the economic effect be? It should be limited and that is mainly because it's clear that the UK Government and the US Government will do everything to avoid any further lockdowns. The world awaits the health data from hospitals, first from South Africa's outbreak, and then elsewhere, about its transmissibility and severity. The new restrictions announced here in the UK and around the world reflect real time science, and in particular an expectation that the variant takes some bricks out of the wall of vaccine immunity. That in and of itself will have some economic impact. In the UK, real time data from restaurant reservations and online job adverts were well above the equivalent day last year. Retail footfall was just 8% below the equivalent day in 2019. Things were beginning to get back to normal, even with a considerable number of Delta cases, and a steady stream of weekly deaths. Omicron has paused some of this process, merely by injecting a doubt that the pandemic is behind us. Global markets fall after Moderna Omicron warning\n'We’ve had 20 cancellations in one weekend'\nMandatory masks: 'We worry people won't come in' The restrictions announced are not too onerous, mainly linked to the use of masks. Industry has learned to adapt to the pandemic. But at times half the economic impact of the pandemic has come from consumers voluntarily deciding to socially distance, irrespective of legal restrictions. Already there has been a trickle of cancelled events and Christmas parties, for example, but it's important not to overstate that. Business travel and some tourism is definitely going to be hit due to renewed quarantine requirements. Supply chain bottlenecks that are already holding back recovery are only going to be exacerbated by a wave of transmission that requires some workers to isolate. Should hospitalisations increase however, the government could have to roll out its Plan B for the return of more stringent social restrictions. It really absolutely does not want to return to lockdowns. Past experience suggests this could hit the size of the economy in January by 2-3%. Only in those circumstances would the government renew pandemic financial supports. On Monday, the first ministers of Scotland and Wales asked the Treasury to prepare new emergency funding packages. The Treasury said this was a hypothetical situation and that \"vaccines remain our best line of defence and we'll continue to bolster our defences with an accelerated booster roll-out\". In short, because they do not expect to lockdown, they do not currently expect further support packages will be required. The data on whether the current modest measures will be sufficient won't start to be available until the middle of next month. So the uncertainty is likely to linger into next year, weighing on the economy just as it was starting to get back to normal. The material impact of this will be to strengthen the hand of those at the Bank of England who think that rate rises can wait until February, even as inflation spikes up. US central bank chief Jerome Powell has talked of the need for \"humility\", having underestimated the impact of the Delta variant last year. So the return to normal is on hold. The immediate fate of the economy, though, depends on the hospitalisation data. ",

            "content": "High Street fashion giant Inditex, which owns brands including Zara and Massimo Dutti, has appointed the founder's daughter as its new chairwoman. Marta Ortega will replace Pablo Isla, chairman of Inditex since 2011. Ms Ortega has been with the firm for 15 years, starting out as an assistant at its High Street brand Bershka. \"I have always said I would dedicate my life to building upon my parents' legacy,\" the 37-year-old said. \"I have lived and breathed this company since my childhood, and I have learned from all the great professionals I have worked with over the last 15 years,\" said Ms Ortega, adding that she was deeply honoured by the trust the firm was placing in her. Ms Ortega has been credited with strengthening the retailer's brand image, having led several campaigns, including the launch of Zara's premium collections such as Zara SRPLS and Charlotte Gainsbourg by Zara. Inditex was founded by Amancio Ortega with his ex-wife Rosalia in 1975 in Galicia, Spain. Mr Ortega is one of the world's richest men, with an estimated net worth of $77.8bn (£58.3bn), according to Forbes. He was chairman of Inditex until 2011. Inditex, whose brands also include Pull&Bear and Stradivariusm, has come to dominate High Streets around the world, with more than 6,600 shops globally. Most of its clothing is made close to its Spanish headquarters or in nearby countries such as Portugal, Morocco and Turkey, helping the firm to achieve its famously fast reaction times to new fashion trends. by Vivienne Nunis, BBC business reporter Marta Ortega Pérez began working for Inditex on a shop floor in London 15 years ago. Her new job will be as the company's chairwoman, helping steer a retail behemoth with nearly 7,000 stores, more than 8,000 factories and a market value of $100bn. Is she the right person for the job? She says she's grown up around the company and learned a lot in her time formally working there. But others will see this more as a Spanish version of the hit HBO series \"Succession\", where family members are given preference for top jobs over better qualified members of the team. Indeed shares in Inditex have fallen on news of the appointment. Alongside new chief executive Óscar García Maceiras, Marta Ortega Pérez will face a number of challenges. At a time when consumers are becoming more aware of the environmental costs of fast fashion, Zara particularly is in an awkward spot - its reputation is built on bringing style trends to High Street stores quickly and cheaply. There are also supply chain concerns. Just this week, authorities in the French city of Bordeaux rejected plans by a Zara store to double its floor space, over allegations the fashion label may have profited from the forced labour of Uighurs in China. But the new chief executive and chairwoman are unlikely to be steering the Inditex ship without the help of founder Amancio. When he resigned as chairman in 2011, he didn't put his feet up. Instead the man known as \"The Boss\" has remained very much involved in the company. Though now aged in his 80s, it's a fair bet he'll remain so, even with the appointment of the new executive team. The group also announced the appointment of new chief executive Óscar García Maceiras on Tuesday. He joined Inditex in March as general counsel and secretary of the board, following a career as a Spanish state attorney and in the private sector working for several Spanish banks. Inditex shares fell almost 5% after the announcement. Analysts at Kepler said outgoing chairman Mr Isla had driven Inditex's big international expansion over the past 17 years. \"We believe that the timing is not the best ... as we believe that both Marta Ortega and the CEO Oscar Maceiras have a lot to prove when it comes to their ability to run this big monster in the middle of the Covid crisis,\" it said. Maureen Hinton, retail research director at GlobalData, says investors and analysts are \"nervous\" about Marta Ortega because she is not well known outside the fashion group, but she doesn't think it is fair to make assumptions about the future of Zara and its owner Inditex. \"They've got two people there who have relevant and long experience of the company - Carlos Crespo and Oscar Maceiras,\" she told the BBC. \"The current chief executive Carlos Crespo has moved over to become chief operating officer, so it's not like he's leaving the company. And they say Oscar Maceiras is good at team building.\" She said talks about a succession plan had been underway at Inditex since Amancio Ortega stepped down in 2011: \"It was something that was going to happen eventually.\" Commenting on Ms Ortega's past performance at Zara, Ms Hinton said: \"It seems to me she has more marketing experience than managing experience, but as chairperson she will be steering the direction of the company, rather than hands-on day-to-day management.\" ",

The bank said the Covid pandemic had accelerated customers' use of digital banking instead of branches. It said none of the sites due to close would be the last bank in town but unions have heavily criticised the plans. \"TSB axing a quarter of its branches in 2022, on top of the numbers already closed, is a bitter blow for many communities,\" said Sharon Graham, general secretary of the Unite union. \"Unite has consistently argued that local banking and access to cash is essential especially for those on lower incomes.\" About 150 staff will be affected by the closures, but will be offered alternative roles. What does it mean for a town when a bank closes?\nCo-op Bank snubbed in TSB takeover approach TSB has published a list of the branches it is planning to close, which span the country and include nine in Scotland. \"Closing branches is an incredibly difficult decision to take, said Robin Bulloch, from TSB. \"These changes allow us to maintain an extensive branch presence across the country. They are accompanied by a significant investment programme to upgrade branches to better suit customer needs. And, where it takes longer to get to the nearest branch, we will introduce more 'pop-up' services in communities.\" These pop-up services, based in town halls, libraries and community centres in 10 areas, will allow customers to conduct basic banking, as well as receive digital support. The government has published plans to ensure consumers and businesses have a legal right to withdraw and deposit cash within \"a reasonable distance\" of their home or premises. TSB recently faced a public outcry over plans to shut a museum at the site of the world's first savings bank. The small cottage museum is on the site where Rev Henry Duncan set up his \"penny bank\" for parishioners in 1810. A deal has since been struck to transfer the site to another company in order to keep it open. ",

            "content": "EasyJet has seen \"some weakening\" in bookings amid concern about the new Covid variant, the airline's boss says. But Johan Lundgren told the BBC it was too early to assess what the full impact might be, saying: \"We need to see how things settle down.\" He also said bookings for next summer were largely unaffected, with strong pent-up demand likely to see a return close to pre-pandemic 2019 levels. The Omicron variant has led to the imposition of new travel rules. The new strain, which emerged in South Africa, had an immediate impact on the services of long-haul airlines such as British Airways and Virgin Atlantic. But as the virus spreads there are fears short-haul European airlines such as EasyJet could also be hit. Mr Lundgren told the BBC's Today programme his airline had not so far seen the same impact on bookings as when previous restrictions were introduced. He said the customer booking changes had mostly been people moving imminent trips to early next year. Mr Lundgren said he was supportive of the swift re-introduction of the \"red list\" crackdown on travel, but \"there's a question mark around the blanket PCR testing\" for infection. \"It's not obvious to me that if you're travelling in from a country… that doesn't have any reported cases of the Omicron, that you should assume that you should have to take an expensive PCR test,\" he said. New Covid variant leads to scramble for flights\nYour Covid refund rights if flights are cancelled\nMorocco bans UK flights due to Covid cases rising On Monday, EasyJet said it would extend its fee-free rebooking policy until March 2022. Mr Lundgren said the airline's restructuring during the collapse in air travel at the height of the pandemic meant it was well placed to handle any further disruption. The airline, which has cut costs and prioritised the strongest routes, said it had seen an encouraging start to the winter season. In a financial update on Tuesday, EasyJet reported that revenue booked for the second half of its financial year was ahead of 2019 levels. The airline is increasing its fleet plan by 25 aircraft, with slots added at Gatwick, Porto, Lisbon and Milan's Linate. However, the carrier still reported a loss before tax of £1.14bn for the year to end-September, up from a £835m loss the year before. Despite the hefty loss, which covered some of the worst periods of the pandemic, the figure was still better than expected, according to Sophie Lund-Yates of share broker Hargreaves Lansdown. She said EasyJet's restructuring, low-cost business model, and strong route network with bases at popular destinations, was cause for optimism about a bounce-back. However, she added: \"Airlines can't seem to catch a break. News of new Covid variants, and the potential for further travel restrictions, makes it incredibly difficult to predict trading patterns from here. \"There is no getting away from the fact [EasyJet has] further to climb and the coming months will be patchy at best.\" Meanwhile, other airlines voiced caution about the possible impact of Omicron on trading. The president of Dubai-based long haul carrier Emirates, Tim Clark, said a major hit to peak winter travel would cause serious problems for global aviation. He told Reuters news agency: \"December is a very important month for the air travel business. If that is lost, or the winter is lost to a lot of carriers, there will be significant traumas in the business, certainly the aviation business and the periphery.\" And the Scandinavian operator SAS said in a financial statement on Tuesday \"we remain cautious due to prevailing uncertainties\".

            "header": "Mandatory masks: 'We worry people won't shop with us'",
            "content": "Face coverings have become mandatory again in shops and on public transport in England as a precaution against the new Omicron variant of coronavirus. But shopkeepers are concerned that this could have a serious impact on their businesses, at a time when violence and verbal abuse against retail and hospitality staff is at an all-time high. Here's what people in the sector had to say. Katie Pitts, co-owner of Leeds-based fashion boutique The Dressing Room, is worried that frustration over the pandemic might affect consumers' spending behaviour this Christmas. \"We've got a lot of lovely customers who have helped us through a tough time, but people are a bit frustrated,\" she says. \"We're a non-essential retailer, so if they don't feel like wearing a mask, they might not come in.\" Although The Dressing Room has a website, 70% of all sales still come from footfall to the store, as customers prefer to try clothing on before they buy, says Ms Pitt. So far, no customers have declined to wear masks and Ms Pitts hopes it stays that way. \"It's not a discussion we want to have, it's not our rule, it's a rule we have to go by,\" she says. Where do you have to wear masks now? Nigel Bourne, the owner of Sussex-based cookware retailer Rye Cookshop, tells the BBC face covering rules should \"never have gone out in the first place\". He says he wishes the government would \"be stronger on advertising\" how people should wear masks, having experienced some customers wearing them wrongly. The shop owner, based in Rye, East Sussex, says he hasn't had to call the police over people not wearing masks as no-one has been abusive. But he has had to ask people to leave his shop. \"It's hard work all the policing of it. We do it for ourselves and for other people. I do not want to work in a shop where people are not wearing their masks properly. \"If the law says you have got to wear it, wear it.\" The guidance over how face coverings will be enforced in shops and on public transport will be set out in due course, the Department for Health and Social Care told the BBC. The National Police Chiefs' Council says police forces will \"continue to enforce coronavirus regulations where it is necessary to do so\" and will support transport and retail staff in ensuring people wear face coverings. It is unclear whether penalties for those who refuse to wear masks without good reason will change. Previously, people faced a £200 fine which was reduced to £100 if paid within 14 days. The fine doubled for each subsequent offence and could go up to £6,400 for the sixth and subsequent offences. Assistant Chief Constable Owen Weatherill says officers will respond to incidents where \"individuals are violent or abusive towards staff or members of the public\" and will be more visible in towns and shopping centres. According to the Office for National Statistics, 85% of adults said they had worn a face covering outside their home in the past seven days, with 70% saying they wore one often or always while shopping. However, just 18% of people shopping said that everyone or almost everyone they saw was wearing a face covering. Supermarket chain Iceland says it will not be policing whether customers are wearing face masks. Iceland's managing director Richard Walker told the BBC's Today programme that while staff and customer safety was a priority, he did not want to put his staff at \"risk of confrontation or abuse\". \"I think over 90% of retail staff have been threatened, assaulted or abused in the last 12 months and we alone have had over 4,000 incidents of reported verbal abuse each year,\" he said. During the first coronavirus lockdown from March-May last year, the number of incidents rose to more than 50 incidents a week, he added. \"Since staff were told not to challenge customers, that figure dropped tenfold to five a week,\" said Mr Walker. \"So I think if the government want it to happen, they must step in to help businesses like us and police the wearing of masks.\" According to consumer expert Kate Hardcastle, business owners are particularly worried about experiencing abuse, particularly when it comes to enforcing social distancing rules. \"Small businesses say they have felt intimidated - one told me they feel they can't operate in their store by themselves. \"They feel they have to have another presence there as support, in case something happens.\" Retailers are concerned about damaging the relationship with their customers, says Ms Hardcastle, at a time when they can't really afford for anything else to go wrong. \"Not only is it unpleasant to deal with, but a lot of shop owners are experiencing recruitment issues. It's not going to entice someone to go into a retail career if they have to cope with ongoing abuse,\" she says. But most of all, Ms Hardcastle says businesses are really \"terrified\" of being ordered by the government to close again. Rebecca Morter, chief executive of sustainable fashion shop Lone Design Club, says she has encountered a couple of customers who don't want to follow Covid rules on masks and social distancing in the past. She agrees with Ms Hardcastle that retailers are most concerned about being forced to close again. \"Anything that helps prevent the new variant and keep the virus spreading is a good thing,\" she says. \"I understand that some people disagree, but we really, really don't want to go into another lockdown, so for us it's important that everyone follows the rules so we can stay open.\" Manchester shopping mall the Trafford Centre told the BBC it would be deploying staff to hand out free masks and encouraging shoppers to wear face coverings unless they are exempt. Doug Russell, health and safety officer at shop workers' union Usdaw, says it is \"extremely regrettable\" that the government didn't keep existing rules on masks in place as the country reopened. Yet workers had no power to make customers wear them anyway, he adds, and that is unlikely to change this time. The fact the issue \"attracted so much aggression by a minority of people\" is a \"social bafflement\", adds Mr Russell. He says the new rules are inevitably going to lead to more \"clashes\" between shop workers and small groups of people who refuse to wear masks. \"Shop workers have been at the forefront all the way throughout the pandemic.\" ",

            "content": "\"We had 20 cancellations over the weekend, mostly for Christmas parties. Customers were phoning to tell us they weren't sure what was going to happen in a few weeks so they'd rather cancel now.\" Damian Wawrzyniak, an award-winning chef, is one of many in the hospitality industry worried about the impact the Omicron variant of coronavirus is having on his business. The sector has been allowed to operate free from restrictions since 19 July, but there are fears customer confidence in eating and drinking out has taken a hit as restaurants and bars prepare for their main money-making period of the year. There are also concerns some measures could return after the government announced it was reintroducing mandatory mask-wearing in shops and on public transport. \"Hospitality has been waiting for Christmas, and if it's not what we were hoping for, there's going to be some casualties across the industry, including my places,\" said Mr Wawrzyniak, who runs House of Feasts in Peterborough. \"We won't be able to survive without that Christmas trade.\" Where do you have to wear masks now?\nWhat Covid rules are being toughened in the UK? Hospitality has been one of the hardest hit industries by the coronavirus pandemic, with many pubs, hotels and eateries being closed during lockdowns. As businesses have begun to recover and recoup lost earnings, a chronic shortage in workers surfaced, with job vacancies reaching the highest levels since records began. Sam Morgan, who owns the restaurants Craft and 8, told the BBC that a corporate booking for a private dining experience cancelled on Monday after the announcement of the new Covid variant. He said the business, which had booked a table for 12 people, told him it had changed its policy and would look to rebook in January. The restaurants purchase fresh produce ahead of large bookings, but Mr Morgan said \"that food will now end up in the bin\" due to the slim chances of a replacement booking. His venues usually received up to 150 enquiries a day, he added, but had only seen about 10 in the last 48 hours. \"People are just freezing and they are not doing anything and that's all to do with consumer confidence,\" said Mr Morgan. The confidence dent to customers would affect hospitality more than other sectors, he added, as people may think: \"Do we really want go out? Do we really need to go? I probably should not book.\" However, Mr Morgan said he was \"encouraged\" that the government had not implemented restrictions on hospitality but said he would be \"naive\" to believe they may not return. He said his businesses relied on larger dining groups of six to 16 people, which would be affected if measures such as the \"rule of six\" returned. \"It's a challenge,\" said Mr Morgan. \"We are fighting a losing battle. We are ladened with debt.\" Meanwhile, Dave Critchley, chef and owner of Lu Ban restaurant in Liverpool, told the BBC his recently-opened business had never seen a \"solid, full December\" due to the pandemic. He said the Chinese-inspired dine-in was starting to see larger groups cancel their bookings. Since the weekend, two outside events the restaurant was catering for cancelled as a result of the new variant. \"It's a real kick in the teeth,\" added Mr Critchley. \"That's big business. It's a double whammy at the moment.\" The chef explained a strong Christmas was something the restaurant was \"desperate for\" due to January being a \"bleak time for hospitality\". \"We still want to have a business on the other side. We have got to expect the worst and hope for the best,\" he said. Industry figures have said the industry could not \"financially sustain another lockdown\", with some calling for government support. Kate Nicholls, chief executive of UK Hospitality, said the return of masks in shops and on public transport would \"undoubtedly have an immediate impact on consumer confidence\", which she said was \"fragile\". \"There is no doubt that this will have a dampening effect just as we were about to head into our busiest trading period,\" she added. Meanwhile, the British Beer and Pub Association said hospitality was a \"safe environment\" and restrictions \"need not be placed on our sector at this time - and particularly during the festive period where we visit the local to see friends and family\". Like others, Mr Wawrzyniak said the industry needs \"clear advice\" from the government. \"It's not for me to tell people to wear a mask or not. That's the government's job,\" he added. \"We went through hell in the last 18 months and we really don't need a repeat of that. We need to know what's going on.\" He said the government's decision to review current measures in three weeks could deliver a further blow. \"What happens if they announce, around 17 December, that they'll lock us down? It will be an absolute disaster.\" A government spokesman said it had taken \"swift and decisive action\" to mandate face coverings in some settings, but this did not apply to hospitality venues. He added: \"We have already provided an unprecedented support package of £352bn which hospitality businesses have had continued access to, and we have published a new Hospitality Strategy to support England's pubs, bars, restaurants and other venues to thrive long-term.\" ",

            "header": "Twitter co-founder Jack Dorsey steps down as chief executive",
            "content": "Twitter co-founder Jack Dorsey is stepping down as chief executive of the company. He will be replaced by the current chief technical officer, Parag Agrawal, Twitter said. Mr Dorsey, who co-founded Twitter in 2006, has been serving as chief executive of both Twitter and payment firm Square. \"It's finally time for me to leave\" he wrote in a statement, saying the company was \"ready to move on.\" Mr Dorsey said he had \"deep\" trust in his replacement. \"I'm deeply grateful for his skill, heart, and soul. It's his time to lead,\" he said. Mr Agrawal joined Twitter in 2011, and has been the firm's head of technology since 2017. Mr Dorsey challenged corporate conventions with his nose-ring, long beard, and a wellness regime including yoga and eating only one meal a day. But he came under pressure from investors, who felt Twitter was not getting the focus it needed while he was also running Square. On Sunday, Mr Dorsey tweeted, apparently unprompted: \"I love Twitter.\" The BBC is not responsible for the content of external sites.\nView original tweet on Twitter In a separate message to the official corporate statement, Mr Dorsey tweeted: \"Not sure anyone has heard but I resigned from Twitter.\" \"There's a lot of talk about the importance of a company being 'founder-led'. Ultimately I believe that's severely limiting and a single point of failure,\" he wrote in an attached email he sent to staff. He added that he would leave the board after his term expires. \"Why not stay or become chair? I believe it's really important to give Parag the space he needs to lead.\" Twitter's share price jumped as rumours of Mr Dorsey's departure emerged, first reported by CNBC. But by mid-afternoon shares were trading just under their value at the end of last week. Victoria Scholar, investment analyst at Interactive Investor, said the development had not come as a surprise to Twitter's board members \"who have reportedly been preparing to say goodbye to Dorsey since last year\". The change was being seen \"as a way for Twitter to turn over a new leaf and take bigger risks\", she said. Perhaps Mr Dorsey's most daring move was to ban former President Donald Trump from the platform, following the riots at the Capitol building. It provoked strong criticism from Mr Trump's supporters. \"People tend to conflate Jack Dorsey with Twitter censorship, but my sense is he's actually done what he could these past few years to keep the platform relatively open,\" tweeted Mike Solana, head of the private equity firm Founders Fund. \"Things will be worse without him, not better. Godspeed, bird king,\" he added. In a way, Jack Dorsey typifies the Silicon Valley chief executive. He's a multi-billionaire - and has founded two hugely successful companies - Twitter and Square. Yet he dresses in tie-dye t-shirts and sports a beard like a wizard. He's a hippie at heart, with high ideals for how technology can change the world for good. He genuinely believes, for example, that Bitcoin has the ability to create \"world peace\". And with Twitter, he certainly has changed the world. In particular it revolutionised how politicians communicate with voters - and how news is communicated with the public. Perhaps the best known user of Twitter was Donald Trump. The populist US president used the platform as a key way of bypassing traditional media. The decision to remove him from the platform after the Capitol Hill riots was undoubtedly the most controversial moment of Jack Dorsey's time. The nature of his departure is also interesting. He is extricating himself from the company, even giving up his board seat. That's very different to say, Jeff Bezos, who retains much influence at Amazon despite stepping down as boss earlier this year. Mr Dorsey claims this is his decision. But at a multi-billion dollar company, there could well be more at play behind the scenes. He is in his mid-40s, and still has lofty ambitions to change the world. With his track record, he may well do so again. The 45-year-old co-founded the company with Biz Stone, Evan Williams and Noah Glass in 2006. Mr Dorsey has, however, become the face of the company, having sent the earliest tweets on the service and due to his long tenure as chief executive. He left the role of Twitter chief in 2008 and founded the digital payments app Square, which has also grown into a multi-billion dollar company. Jack Dorsey's Square in Australia's biggest buyout\nJack Dorsey's first ever tweet sells for $2.9m However, he was brought back to helm Twitter in 2015 after then-chief executive Dick Costolo stepped down. The role has seen him appear in televised inquiries before US politicians to be quizzed about his platform and its potential role in the spread of disinformation - something Twitter has been repeatedly accused of acting too slowly on in recent years. Like other social media sites it has also been accused of political bias on both sides of the US political divide. Calls for his departure came in 2020 from Elliott management, an investment firm which owns a significant amount of Twitter's shares. The firm reportedly felt that a full-time chief executive with only one company to run would be better for Twitter's fortunes. Twitter: Five anti-vaccine strikes and you are out\nTwitter works with news sites to tackle disinformation But the two sides later came to an agreement which saw Mr Dorsey remain in his post. Reacting to the news of Mr Dorsey's resignation, Elliott said the new management team were \"the right leaders for Twitter at this pivotal moment for the company\". The change in leadership comes alongside several other changes to Twitter's board, including the appointment of Bret Taylor, an existing Twitter board member and veteran of Google and Salesforce, as the new chairman. \"I want to thank Jack for his visionary leadership and unrelenting dedication to Twitter since its founding,\" Mr Taylor said. \"Jack returned to Twitter and turned the Company around at the most critical time. The progress since then has been nothing short of incredible. \"Jack has given the world something invaluable and we will continue to carry it forward.\" ",

The original proposal for Anglia Square involved a 20-storey tower block and 1,200 homes, but was halted by then-secretary of state Robert Jenrick. New plans include a 60% smaller tower, 100 fewer homes, and increased green spaces. The Norwich Society said it was with \"a profound sense of relief\" the plans had been changed. It said it welcomed the \"abandonment of the concept of Anglia Square as a major new destination for retail and leisure uses\". But the society said there were \"no grounds for accepting 1,100 homes as the starting point for negotiations\", according to the Local Democracy Reporting Service. It also expressed concern about the \"potentially cavernous effects\" of a planned row of eight-storey blocks. Despite the concerns, it said there could be a \"successful outcome to this process, something which was invisible two years back\". The Norwich Society is a charity which it says is supporting the preservation, development and improvement of features of historic interest of the city.

            "content": "The Omicron variant could add pressure to a chronic shortage of microchips used in car manufacturing, the boss of car giant Nissan has warned. Makoto Uchida said it was too early to say when normal deliveries, and therefore finished cars, would resume. \"I can't give you a date. This new variant could add pressure to that, so how well we react is going to be crucial,\" he told the BBC. Products from cars, washing machines and smartphones rely on computer chips. Some factories had to close when the pandemic first struck in 2020, leading to a backlog in production in microchips, also known as semiconductors. The impact was exacerbated by soaring demand, with people working from home needing laptops, tablets and webcams to help them do their jobs. \"We have a semiconductor shortage as an industry and how we recover from that is critical,\" Mr Uchida told the BBC. Why is there a chip shortage?\nVauxhall Motors warns chip shortage to last months Japan has banned incoming flights from abroad in response to the international alarm over the omicron variant first detected in South Africa. Mr Uchida's comments come as Nissan announced its vehicle electrification strategy, which includes the proposed introduction of 23 electrified models by 2030, and the ambition that by 2026, 75% of the companies European sales will be electric vehicles. Earlier this year, Nissan announced a £1bn investment to turn its Sunderland plant in the UK into a hub for electric vehicle production. Its targets for China and the US are much less ambitious. Nissan hopes that 40% of the cars it sells in China will be electric or hybrid by 2026, while it only expects to hit that same proportion in the US by 2030 given slower consumer take-up. The company did not set a target date for the elimination of combustion engines. At the recent COP26 climate summit, Nissan, along with Toyota, VW and BMW, refused to join Ford and Volvo in signing a pledge to phase them out by 2040. Nissan is also investing more money in developing solid state batteries, which the industry hopes will ultimately prove more efficient than the current industry standard lithium-ion batteries. Mr Uchida said Nissan remained committed to its alliance with Renault and Mitsubishi, which was the brainchild of former Nissan boss Carlos Ghosn who is now living in exile in Beirut having been smuggled out of Japan while awaiting criminal prosecution on charges of financial crime. Mr Ghosn strenuously denies the charges. ",

            "header": "Online sellers 'hotbed' for dangerous items experts warn",
            "content": "A group of emergency services, consumer watchdogs and safety groups want the government to make online sellers more liable for selling dangerous items. Online marketplaces are a \"hotbed\" for risky electronics, such as hairdryers and straighteners with electric shock risks, and dangerous toys, it says. The group wants sites like Amazon, eBay, Wish and AliExpress to be held responsible for unsafe listings. Each of these retailers removed dangerous listings when contacted. At the moment, \"gaps in the law\" mean that such marketplaces are not held to the same standards as High Street shops, the group said. That means \"they have no responsibility for the safety of products sold to millions of consumers via their platforms\". That is because many purchases are made with \"third-party\" sellers - so the website itself is facilitating the purchase, but not selling it themselves. In a letter to government ministers, the group said the status quo \"continues to place consumers at risk\". Sue Davies from consumer group Which? - one of the signatories - said legislation \"is not fit for purpose and does not account for the massive shift to online shopping\". The letter is signed by the National Fire Chiefs Council, London Fire Brigade, Electrical Safety First, the British Toy and Hobby Association, and the Child Accident Prevention Trust, among others. Issues the group says it has identified include children's toys still going on sale that had already been found to fall short of safety standards - for example, when tiny button or \"coin\" batteries could be accessed by a small child and potentially swallowed. Dangerous products remain for sale on Wish\nRegulators allowed to take down eBay listings\nFestive lights sold online 'can be a fire risk' It also said there are plugs for high-powered devices that have no fuses, or do not meet UK electrical standards for safety. It says such examples are just part of a \"range of unsafe products being sold to consumers every day\". The letter lays out evidence to prove its point, including: 63% of electrical products from online marketplaces were \"non-compliant\" and nearly a quarter were unsafe, according to Office for Product Safety and Standards research\nunsafe children's toys that had been recalled from retailers were, in 69% of cases, still being sold online\nWhich? research discovered children's toys with toxic chemicals, dangerous \"sleeping bags\" for newborn babies, and smoke alarms that did not work - all for sale\nBritish Toy and Hobby Association research on toys sold by third-party online sellers found that 88% of samples bought in a year were illegal to sell in the UK, and 48% were unsafe \"This cannot be allowed to continue,\" the letter said. It said that given the shift towards digital purchases and Brexit, updates to the law are needed. \"It is time to close this dangerous gap in the law that allows online marketplaces to hold little to no responsibility for the safety of the products from which they profit,\" said Lesley Rudd, chief executive of Electrical Safety First. \"For too long consumers have been left to navigate online marketplaces with inadequate legal protection or confidence that what they are buying is safe.\" The campaign comes days after French politicians asked online platforms to remove listings from Wish over safety concerns. The companies accused of falling short were also given the chance to respond to allegations from the group. Wish said it was \"committed to creating a safe and fun environment for users to shop online, and continue to deploy further measures to help prevent, detect, and remove unsafe items from the platform\". EBay, meanwhile, said its security team \"has performed sweeps to identify and remove other listings offering such products, informed the relevant buyers and that appropriate action has been taken against the sellers\". It says that its automatic filters have blocked millions of unsafe listings from ever going live. Amazon said safety was important, adding: \"We have proactive measures in place to prevent suspicious or non-compliant products from being listed and we monitor the products sold in our stores for product safety concerns. \"When appropriate, we remove a product from the store, reach out to sellers, manufacturers, and government agencies for additional information, or take other actions.\" And Chinese site AliExpress said \"We take very seriously the safety of all our customers and we work hard to ensure a safe shopping environment.\" It highlighted that it was a \"third-party online marketplace\" rather than selling items itself, but said \"we have strict platform rules that require all third-party sellers to comply with all applicable local laws and regulations\".

            "header": "More work needed to create green jobs, report says",
            "content": "Efforts to create so-called green jobs need to intensify if the UK government is to achieve its target of two million roles by 2030, according to a report. Jobs linked to the green economy accounted for 1.2% of all advertised roles in the year to July 2021, consultancy PwC said. That equates to just 124,600 new jobs. Boosting green job creation is part of the government's \"green industrial revolution\" plans. In November 2020, the government announced £4bn would be spent as part of its plans to create two million green jobs by 2030. Green jobs: The new generation of workers making it work for them\nCOP26: Leaders agree global plan to boost green technology The COP 26 summit held in Glasgow a year later has put the issue into sharp focus again. But there are concerns that the green jobs transition could pose some risks, as it will have an impact on traditional jobs, especially in polluting industries. In September, the Trade Union Congress (TUC) warned up to 660,000 jobs could be at risk if the UK fails to reach its net-zero target as quickly as other nations. The simplest answer is a job that directly contributes to tackling climate change, although many think it should also cover roles that indirectly support that ambition. Growing sectors where one might find more green jobs being advertised include low-carbon farming, heating without emissions, and wind turbine maintenance. In its research, PwC said jobs that support the green economy indirectly should also be considered green. Such roles might include environmental advisers or experts in environmental or sustainability research and education. PwC's report said work was needed to ensure the move to a net-zero economy does not add to regional inequalities. It found that Wales, Northern Ireland and Yorkshire and the Humber lagged behind other parts of the UK in terms of transitioning to a greener economy. Scotland and London were the top performers, according to the research. PwC ranked areas in terms of how they performed in job creation, the benefits of green jobs, the loss of \"sunset jobs\", the carbon intensity of employment, and green workplaces. They hunted for online job ads that mentioned things like sustainability and environment - there had to be a number of mentions. Kevin Ellis, PwC chairman and senior partner, said: \"Jobs are getting greener and this is cause for optimism, but evidence is needed on the level and distribution of these opportunities. \"Left unchecked, green employment will grow in the most fertile spots, but not necessarily where they're needed most. \"By acting now, we have a massive opportunity to rebalance the economy and ensure a fair transition.\" A government spokesman told the BBC: \"As this data shows, hundreds of thousands of green jobs are being created across the country, and our landmark Net Zero Strategy sets out how the UK will accelerate this growth, unlocking £90bn in private investment. \"Our plans will see the majority of new green jobs to be created and supported outside London and the south east, with our shift to a low carbon economy providing an unprecedented opportunity to attract new, future-proof businesses in our industrial heartlands.\" ",

            "header": "More than 17 million have used buy now, pay later services",
            "content": "More than 17 million UK customers have now used a buy now pay later (BNPL) company to make an online purchase, company data shows. The payment method is also set to have its biggest Christmas yet, experts say. BNPL firms allow people to manage their shopping, either by postponing their bill for a short while, or splitting it into more manageable chunks over time, interest free. But critics say users too easily end up in debt and tougher rules are needed. The biggest provider in the UK, Klarna, has seen its customer base double to 15 million since early 2020. The market's other main players, Clearpay and LayBuy, are also expanding fast. Growth is fastest among users in their 40s and 50s, showing BNPL is no longer just a millennial and Gen Z trend. A recent survey for Citizens Advice found that almost one in 10 people were planning to use BNPL to help with Christmas shopping. Kate Hobson from Citizens Advice urged consumers \"not to spend more than they can afford\". \"If you're considering using buy now pay later, make sure you understand what you're signing up for, how you'll make the repayments and what will happen if you can't pay on time,\" she added. The main players in the market, however, feel they offer consumers a hassle-free means to pay for purchases without interest. It is also much cheaper than a credit card if late payment fees aren't incurred, they add. Buy Now Pay Later: 'I'm stressed over debt'\nCharities sound alarm over buy-now-pay-later debt Klarna, which launched in the UK in 2014, charges no interest or fees if payments are on time and claims around 40% of users repay money early. The service launched a \"pay now\" option and updated its terms ahead of an expected crackdown on the sector. Platform Clearpay stresses it does not report late paying users to credit agencies, and maintains that many of its users are in fact better with their money than they are given credit for. \"There are misperceptions that young people are bad at saving and investing money, however a report by Accenture on Clearpay users has shown that young people are more cautious with money than older people,\" a spokesperson said. LayBuy saw transactions grow 500% between 2019 and 2020 and the company reported a 56% spike in transactions last November, as Christmas shopping commenced. The family-run business, which was the first to run affordability checks on users, has since listed on the Australian Stock Exchange. Millions of shoppers use buy now pay later services to spread the cost of their online shopping throughout the year. Like any kind of credit, if you keep on top of it, it can be a sensible way of making sure you're not hit with a big bill at one point of the year. But of course it also makes it more tempting to spend more than you would do otherwise, especially with fewer credit checks. At this time of year, with so many different credit options available and other bills due for payment, lots of customers can get stuck in a real quagmire. It's always important to check the terms and conditions before you sign up - figure out what you are expected to pay back and when, don't just clip 'Pay Later' and hope for the best. If you do get into difficulties then flag it up quickly, most of the companies can arrange repayment plans with you which are more manageable if you contact them. And of course get advice from a debt charity directly if you are feeling stuck. The Treasury is consulting on how to regulate the BNPL sector, and the Financial Conduct Authority will publish proposals some time next year. A Treasury spokesperson said it was taking a \"proportionate approach\". \"Buy now pay later can be a helpful way to manage your finances so it's important that regulation is balanced and proportionate, ensuring that customers are given appropriate protections.\" But many charities want action to be taken sooner, arguing that many consumers could be pushed into borrowing more than they can afford this Christmas. Debt charity Christians Against Poverty recognises BNPL can be \"attractive\", especially at Christmas, but it worries users could lose track of spending. \"We're particularly concerned about those consumers who turn to credit like BNPL as a means of keeping on top of essentials, like bills or the weekly food shop,\" said spokesman Jonathan Shaw. \"Add to this the additional pressure to spend at Christmas and consumers can be left in an even more financially difficult situation.\" Growth in the sector shows no sign of slowing down. Established money brands Paypal and Monzo are poised to enter the market, and BNPL technology is evolving so that some brands can be used to make any purchase on any site. ",

            "header": "737 Max: Boeing refutes new safety concerns",
            "content": "It has been called \"the most scrutinised transport aircraft in history\", but some critics believe Boeing's 737 Max is still not safe. It was cleared to fly passengers again by US regulators last year, having been grounded following two catastrophic accidents. Since then, however, a number of potentially serious problems have been reported during 737 Max flights. Boeing insists the aircraft is both safe and reliable. On 14 October, a 737 Max took off from Boeing Field airport in Seattle, bound for Brussels. It was a delivery flight, taking the brand-new plane to start work for its owners, the travel group Tui. But minutes into the 5,000-mile journey, the pilots reported an urgent \"flight control problem\" and had to turn back. The aircraft landed safely shortly afterwards. The issue, linked to the autopilot, was rectified relatively quickly. The plane set off for Brussels again the following day, and has been flying regularly since then. However, this was not an isolated incident. Whenever a US carrier or repair station discovers any serious failure, malfunction or defect aboard an aircraft, it has to inform the US regulator, the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA), via a so-called \"service difficulty report\". There have been more than 180 such reports since the 737 Max returned to service. Most faults were found on planes that were on the ground. But on 22 occasions, they occurred in-flight, and on four of those the pilots declared emergencies. Former Boeing 737 Max pilot charged with fraud\nBoeing agrees deal with Ethiopia crash families\nCoronavirus: Boeing says air travel to recover by 2024 US pilots also declared emergencies on two further occasions due to engine failures. These events do not currently appear in the FAA's database, but have been reported on the Aviation Herald website, which lists accidents and incidents in commercial aviation. The problems occurred in a US fleet that is still relatively small, with fewer than 160 aircraft delivered as of mid-October - some of which were grounded for several weeks early in the year after the discovery of electrical issues. Service difficulty reports are also made public by the Canadian regulator, Transport Canada. Its database shows that the Canadian fleet of 56 737 Max aircraft has generated 19 reports, five of them relating to in-flight incidents. The 737 Max remains under intense scrutiny. The plane was grounded for 20 months from March 2019, after being involved in two major accidents, in which 346 people died. Its flight control software was modified, to remove a serious flaw implicated in both crashes. Other physical changes were made to the aircraft. It is important to stress that none of the issues reported to the FAA and Transport Canada are directly related either to the causes of these crashes, or to the changes made afterwards. But they do include problems with some critical systems, including the motors used to adjust the horizontal stabiliser - the wing on the tailplane of the aircraft. There have also been faults with engines, flight control systems, hydraulics and wiring. The horizontal stabiliser, in particular, is vital for keeping the aircraft in controlled flight. It can be adjusted manually, using a wheel by the pilot's knee. But under certain conditions, for example if the aircraft is going too fast, that may not be possible due to the aerodynamic loads involved. Joe Jacobsen is a former senior safety engineer at the FAA, which has been deeply critical of the way in which the agency originally certified the 737 Max. He says the reports do give cause for concern, particularly regarding the stabiliser motors, wiring and flight control systems. Such issues, he says, are most likely to be blamed on manufacturing. \"If they are not manufacturing-related\", he says \"then we have a problem with the system safety analysis, as I don't believe we would have predicted this number of failures is such a short time span with such a small fleet of aircraft.\" Gilles Primeau, a Canadian expert in flight control systems, is also alarmed. He has previously testified to Canadian lawmakers that in his opinion the stabiliser trim system on all 737 variants, not just the Max, is \"obsolete\", and does not have enough in-built redundancy in case of failures. He says \"a fundamental concept for safety-critical systems is that if the effects and severity of a failure cause a hazard, then the frequency of occurrence should be made infrequent enough by design... loss of horizontal stabiliser position can be catastrophic\". Coronavirus: Boeing says air travel to recover by 2024\nBoeing's 737 Max aircraft under scrutiny again\nSigns of 'metal fatigue' on Denver plane engine Ed Pierson is a former senior manager at Boeing's 737 plant, near Seattle, who has previously voiced serious concerns about manufacturing standards at the plant. He says the number of failure and defect reports is \"very troubling\". \"I'm concerned this is just the tip of the iceberg\", he says, adding: \"It makes one wonder what the airline's own maintenance reports say about the condition of these airplanes, if the mandatory reporting looks like this.\" However, not all experts are so alarmed. Dai Whittingham, chief executive of the UK Flight Safety Committee, has also seen the data. \"I don't think it's an unreasonable rate of occurrences,\" he explains. \"With a fleet that size, it's not an unexpected level of problems, for the length of time. \"They are complex systems, so these things happen\" Boeing did not respond to specific questions about the failures featured in the service difficulty reports. In a statement, it said: \"Since the 737 Max returned to service, airlines have flown nearly 240,000 flights around the world, and are conducting more than 1,300 flights every day. \"The in-service reliability is greater than 99%, and is consistent with other commercial airplane models\". People close to the 737 Max programme do, however, acknowledge that there have been specific issues with stabiliser trim motors, and that changes have been made to rectify them. The BBC also understands that regular weekly meetings take place between the aerospace giant and representatives of the engine manufacturer CFM International, in part to address the root causes of failures and in-flight shutdowns. The FAA, meanwhile, said: \"When we returned the 737 Max to service, we noted that routine incidents would occur with the aircraft, just as they do with every other make and model of aircraft. \"The FAA addresses these issues through the same Continued Operational Safety process that we provide for the entire US commercial fleet. We have seen no reported incidents attributable to the redesigned automated flight control system on the Max.\" ",

            "header": "Black Friday on track to beat last year's sales",
            "content": "Black Friday sales are on track to beat the bumper shopping bonanzas of the last two years, latest data suggests. Barclaycard, which processes about £1 in every £3 spent using cards, said by 17:00 GMT, there were 23% more transactions than that point in 2020. And the firm said there was a 2.4% rise in the volume of payments compared with the same period on Black Friday 2019. Analysts PwC predict £8.7bn will be spent on Friday, twice the amount spent last year, during lockdown. It is also higher than the £7.8bn spent before the pandemic in 2019. The increase comes despite warnings to expect less generous discounts and some shortages. Black Friday, which began in the US, sees retailers slash prices to entice shoppers ahead of the Christmas period. It is officially on Friday 26 November but retailers' campaigns span the whole month and started earlier than ever this year, with some in October. 'I don't need a new TV, but I'll probably get one'\nWarning over Black Friday price offers\nTech retailers warn of low Black Friday stock Rob Cameron, chief executive of Barclaycard Payments, said Black Friday was off to a \"strong start\" despite the country's economic challenges. \"As we reach the end of the Black Friday, it is great to see that the trend we have been seeing throughout the day has continued, and retailers will be happy that today's trading figures have surpassed those secured in 2019. \"They will be hoping for this spending pattern to continue, not only in the last few hours of trading, and into Cyber Monday, but also in the run up to the festive season.\" Metapack, a firm that connects major retailers with parcel delivery services, said data indicated that the biggest shipping days would take place on Monday and Tuesday, the same as last year. PwC predicts about 60% of adults in the UK will make purchases, spending an average of £280 each. But people are not only venturing out for shopping trips. On Friday, protestors gathered at Amazon buildings in the UK, US and Europe, with unions, equality and environmental groups saying Black Friday \"epitomises an obsession with over-consumption\". Meanwhile, Extinction Rebellion has targeted Amazon depots in the UK, blocking entrances and access roads. Linda Ellett, head of consumer markets at analysts KPMG, said deals were likely to be worse this year as retailers struggled with global supply issues linked to the pandemic, and shortages of HGV drivers and warehouse staff. Black Friday is the first big test for supply chains in the all important \"golden quarter\" for retailers. Shoppers have been buying early, worried they won't get the presents they want if they leave it until the last minute this year. Black Friday started as a one-day event but is now almost a month long blizzard of promotions. But expect fewer deals overall this time around amid all the problems over stock availability and labour shortages. Many retailers can ill afford to slash prices when their costs are soaring. Retailers also want to smooth out demand to try to reduce the pressure on distribution centres where goods are picked, packed and despatched over the big Black Friday weekend. A lot of businesses have been removing next day delivery options to help them cope. Some businesses, especially smaller independents, will shun this event altogether. It may have a lost a bit of its lustre, but Black Friday is still a massive shopping event. And it will probably be the most well organised retailers with scale and the biggest clout over suppliers who will cope the best. There are concerns some retailers will not be able to meet demand on the day, leading to long waits for orders to be processed and delivered. But analysts say most brands have spent months preparing for the sale and will have enough stock - although shoppers will not always get their first choice of product. John Lewis told the BBC: \"We've worked closely with our suppliers and we are confident we've got an extensive range of deals across a wide range of categories that represent great value for our customers.\" AO World, which has hired 500 extra drivers ahead of the day, said: \"Like all electrical retailers, we are currently unable to get all the stock we need in categories like gaming to meet customer demand largely because of global microchip shortages. \"We are working closely with our partners so that our customers continue to get the exceptional service and range they rely on.\" Metapack thinks most retailers will avoid a \"perfect storm\" but a few could be unlucky. \"We've already seen retailers reach out and suggest customers buy early for Christmas which should ease the pressure,\" said senior vice president Tom Forbes. Some big brands such as M&S and Next have shunned Black Friday this year, with M&S again saying its focus was on \"offering great value throughout the whole season\". Many independent shops have also opted-out as they cannot afford to offer deep discounts in the vital Christmas shopping period. Mike Cherry, chairman of the Federation of Small Businesses, urged shoppers to support smaller local businesses who are \"pinning their hopes to a bumper festive season\" after last year's restrictions. He said: \"Rather than reaching for the same old brands - where deals might not be all they seem in any case - shop bespoke, receive one-to-one personal service and give some new restaurants, cafes and pubs a try.\" Shoppers have also been warned to check whether offers are all they seem. An investigation by consumer rights group Which? found that 92% of Black Friday deals in 2020 were the same price or cheaper in the six months before the event. The Potions Cauldron gift shop in York is one of the independent retailers not taking part in Black Friday. Manager Phil Pinder thinks it's an American invention driven by retailers like Amazon who want to \"squeeze everyone else out\". \"I read a story saying that some of the electrical retailers are going to run out of stock by Christmas from doing Black Friday deals. \"I'm not playing that game... it seems illogical.\" The shop, which sells magical themed drinks, sweets and gifts, has been doing well this year but it is struggling with product shortages due to supply chain issues. Phil says it is missing about £50,000 of stock it hoped to sell before Christmas which is \"a real headache\". His message to shoppers this festive season is buy early: \"If you want to get a specific present, go out and get it now. There are probably not going to be many of those last minute sales this Christmas because I don't think the retailers will have the stock.\" ",

Shares in airlines and travel firms were hit hard, with BA-owner IAG and Wizz Air down 15%. Tui shed 10%. The UK and other nations have introduced a ban on flights from six southern African countries. UK Health Secretary Sajid Javid said scientists were \"deeply concerned\" about the new Covid strain and its potential to evade immunity. The UK has temporarily banned flights from South Africa, Namibia, Zimbabwe, Botswana, Lesotho and Eswatini starting from midday on Friday until 04:00 on Sunday. What are the UK travel rules?\nLive: Latest on the new variant All six counties are being added to the UK's travel red list. It means that any British or Irish resident arriving from the countries after 04:00 on Sunday will have to quarantine in a hotel, with those returning before that being asked to isolate at home. The FTSE 100 index suffered its biggest one day drop in more than a year. Shares of major UK lenders HSBC, Lloyds Bank, NatWest and Barclays all fell about 7% as investors scaled back expectations of a Bank of England interest rate rise in December. The biggest FTSE 100 riser was food delivery firm Ocado, up 4.5%, on anticipation that online firms could be a beneficiary if tighter restrictions are reintroduced. Cruise operator Carnival suffered a 15% slide, making it the biggest faller on the FTSE 250, while EasyJet tumbled 11.5%. Neil Wilson, chief market analyst at Markets.com said investors fear a new Covid variant \"will lead to fresh lockdowns, mobility restrictions and lower economic growth\". On Wall Street, the Dow Jones index slumped 2.8% in its shortened trading day following Thursday's Thanksgiving holiday. \"It's Black Friday today for the retailers, but it's 'Red Friday' right now for the stock market,\" said Patrick O'Hare at Briefing.com. Concern the new variant could slow global economic growth sent oil prices sharply lower. US WTI crude tumbled 11.3% to $69.53 per barrel, while European benchmark Brent retreated 10.2% to $73.81. The price of gold, a haven for investors in troubled times, rose. Despite the fall in the FTSE 100, the index is still trading nearly 12% higher than it was a year ago. A number of other countries - such as Germany, Italy and Israel - have banned flights from the six southern African nations. Both Germany and France's leading stock market indexes fell by more than 3% on Friday. European Commission president Ursula von der Leyen tweeted that other EU nations should also \"activate the emergency brake\" to stop travel from these countries. The BBC is not responsible for the content of external sites.\nView original tweet on Twitter Overnight stock markets in Japan, Hong Kong and Australia also fell as did indexes in India and South Korea. Oil prices also declined on fears the new Covid strain could lead to restrictions and dampen demand. Brent crude extended earlier declines to fall by 5.86% to $77.43 a barrel by early afternoon. \"The drop in the oil price is the market's way of saying it is worried about a reduction in economic activity,\" said Russ Mould, investment director at AJ Bell. In London, shares in oil giant BP dropped by 6.2%% while rival Shell also saw its share price fall by more than 4.6%. But Mr Mould added: \"The flipside of falling commodity prices is that a weaker oil price should provide some relief in terms of inflationary pressures. \"That may cause central banks to be more cautious towards raising rates in the near-term, however it does depend on whether the new Covid strain causes significant disruption or can be contained as best as possible in a rapid manner.\" Mr Javid said more needed to be learned about the new Covid variant. Only 59 confirmed cases have been identified in South Africa, Hong Kong and Botswana so far. However, he said the variant had a significant number of mutations, \"perhaps double the number of mutations that we have seen in the Delta variant\". He said that adding the six countries to the red list was about \"being cautious and taking action and trying to protect, as best we can, our borders\". How worrying is the new Covid variant?\nCovid variants: Do we need new vaccines yet? BA said: \"We'll be contacting affected customers with information about their flight.\" It added it was advising passengers to monitor the latest travel advice with the UK government and on the BA website. Virgin Atlantic said its flights from Johannesburg to London Heathrow would be cancelled between midday on Friday to early on Sunday morning. \"We're currently reviewing our schedule of South Africa operations for the coming week,\" it added. The carrier said any customers booked to travel to or from South Africa with Virgin Atlantic should check on the company's website. If they have booked through third parties or agents, they should get in touch with them. ",

            "content": "Protests are being staged at Amazon buildings in the UK, US, and Europe - on Black Friday. The shopping sales day is among Amazon's busiest all year. An international coalition of unions, equality and environmental groups called \"Make Amazon Pay\" is staging a day of action. The movement is demanding Amazon make changes to its business, including improved pay, an end to employee surveillance, and union engagement. In an unrelated separate protest, the Extinction Rebellion environmental group has blocked the entrances to Amazon distribution centres in the UK. The group says it has targeted 13 British buildings, including the largest one in Dunfermline. It is staging similar action abroad in Germany and Netherlands. Extinction Rebellion targets Amazon distribution centres\nBlack Friday spending set to soar despite fewer deals\nCan you buy the tech you want on Black Friday? The Make Amazon Pay coalition is not affiliated with Extinction Rebellion group, but also has environmental groups such as Greenpeace among its members. \"Amazon takes too much and gives back too little,\" it claims - backed by trade unions, grassroots campaigns and non-profit-making organisations in individual countries. In the UK, that includes: the GMB Union\nTrades Union Congress\nMomentum\nWar on Want\nInternational Transport Workers' Federation\nLabour Behind the Label No UK Amazon warehouses are unionised, so legally they can't strike. Many employees will be working on the day, but campaign groups which include Amazon workers are staging protests at Amazon buildings in Coalville, Leicestershire, Coventry, Peterborough and at its London headquarters. But strikes are being encouraged elsewhere. In Germany, for example, the union Verdi called on employees at major shipping centres to strike, beginning on Wednesday night. And in France, major union CGT is also calling for workers to down tools. Worldwide, nearly 50 organisations have signed up to a list of \"common demands\", published by the Make Amazon Pay coalition, which include: raising warehouse workers' pay and adding hazard pay and peak time increments\nhalting worker \"surveillance\" and strict productivity targets\nextending sick leave and improving Covid-19 tracking and reporting\nending casual employment status and \"union-busting\" activities\npaying taxes without using loopholes or tax havens Owen Espley, from the War on Want campaign group, said: \"Amazon is abusing its dominance across online retail, cloud services, and logistics, to create unfair competition that is driving down standards for everyone.

It filed Freedom of Information requests with four ambulance trusts near \"major Amazon sites\". It said the data shows that over five years, November had the most ambulance visits. The BBC is not responsible for the content of external sites.\nView original tweet on Twitter Amazon said such claims were \"using incomplete information that's without context and designed to intentionally mislead\". \"We know we're not perfect and are continuing to get better every day, but the fact is that Amazon has 40% fewer injuries on average compared to other transportation and warehousing businesses in the UK,\" a spokesperson said. It claimed the \"vast majority\" of ambulance visits to its buildings were for pre-existing conditions. Mick Rix, from the GMB Union, said: \"This company is a pandemic profiteer that can afford to do better.\" \"It's time for Amazon sit down with their workers' union GMB and make Amazon a great, safe place to work. \" Amazon reported a tripling of profits earlier this year, attributed to its success during the Covid-19 pandemic. Amazon issued a prepared statement in advance of the protests about the wider Make Amazon Pay movement. \"These groups represent a variety of interests, and while we are not perfect in any area, if you objectively look at what Amazon is doing in each one of these areas you'll see that we do take our role and our impact very seriously,\" it said. \"We are inventing and investing significantly in all these areas, playing a significant role in addressing climate change with the Climate Pledge commitment to be net zero carbon by 2040, continuing to offer competitive wages and great benefits, and inventing new ways to keep our employees safe and healthy in our operations network, to name just a few.\" ",

            "content": "A global shortage of fertilisers is driving up food prices and leaving poorer countries facing crisis, says the boss of a major fertiliser firm. Svein Tore Holsether, chief executive of Yara International, said higher gas prices were pushing up fertiliser costs and affecting food prices worldwide. Fertiliser requires large amounts of gas in its production. Mr Holsether said Yara had been forced to cut some production due to higher gas prices, which had led to shortages. The chief executive said developing countries would be hit hardest by the shortages, with crop yields declining and food prices rising. \"It's really scary, we are facing a food crisis and vulnerable people are being hit very hard,\" he told the BBC's Today programme. \"It's impacting food prices all over the world and it hits the wallets of many people. But for some people, especially in the developing world, this is not only a question about the wallet, but it's a question of life or death.\" Less fertiliser, Mr Holsether said, meant farmers in developing countries would not be able to plant as efficiently, leading to smaller crops. Farmers apply fertilizers to boost yields of crops such as corn, canola and wheat. The process of creating ammonia, which is present in many fertilisers, currently relies on hydropower or natural gas. The increase in gas prices in recent months has been triggered by several factors which have increased demand, including the unlocking of economies during the pandemic and reduced wind or rain for renewable power. This has led to a sharp rise in the cost of producing fertiliser, with the price of ammonia - the product Yara International produces more than anyone in the world - up 255% on last year. Mr Holsether said the situation was \"very volatile\" and called for support and funding for the World Food Programme \"to avoid famine at massive scale\". He said that last year Yara donated 40,000 tonnes of fertiliser, which resulted in small-hold farms in East Africa tripling their crop yields. \"It says a lot about the impact that fertiliser can have,\" he added.

            "content": "If all has gone according to plan, and the Thanksgiving feast didn't make them too sleepy, AJ and his wife Samantha will have set off from their Manhattan home at midnight for some serious Black Friday shopping in nearby New Jersey. \"I'm excited,\" says AJ, who works in a school. \"There'll probably be a crowd like you've never seen before.\" They don't need a new television, but AJ would like to pick up a new 70 inch screen if there's a bargain to be had. \"Every year, whether you need one or not, you look for a TV,\" he says. They'll also look for video games, other electronics, clothes, sweaters, cardigans, jackets, clothes for the kids. \"Whatever has the highest percentage off,\" he says. Samantha, a security guard, is already browsing the stores for something new to wear after a year-and-a half at home in a tracksuit, something stretchy, she says, to cope with that Thanksgiving dinner. Against the glitter of Christmas lights and sequined party-wear, US shops have been lining up the price promotions again in the run up to the Black Friday weekend, which traditionally kicks off the festive shopping season. This year is shaping up to be a bumper one, despite a backdrop of steeply rising prices, staffing and supply chain problems, and Covid rates that are rising too. Many Americans have saved money during the pandemic, topped up by government support payments, in the form of stimulus cheques and child tax credits. That's already been finding its way into the cash registers. So far this year retailers have already sold 15% more than they had by this time last year, and its 21% more than in 2019. \"It's like adding 50 million Americans to the economy in terms of demand,\" says Mark Mathews, vice president of the National Retail Federation. He and many others are predicting the spending spree will continue. UK Black Friday spending set to soar despite fewer deals\nWhy Christmas may be stuck in a shipping container \"The consumer is on fire,\" says Neil Saunders, managing director of GlobalData Retail. \"We've never seen spending this high.\" People have started to socialise a bit more, he says, so they're buying party clothes. Some have lost weight, some have put it on during the pandemic, and need new outfits. And cash that's not going on holidays and commuting is being spent on things for the home. It adds up to \"astonishing\" levels of spending, he says. It's a boon for the big brands and chains. Target, Walmart, Home Depot, Abercrombie & Fitch, Dick's Sporting Goods, Bath and Body Works, accessories firm Tapestry, have all managed to cash in, with strong results already. Neil Saunders puts it down in part at least to the American psyche, which he says is \"extremely robust\". Optimism and patriotism keep people spending, he says. Paris Ratcliff and her aunt Phyllis put it down to happiness - and the sheer relief that things are better than last year. \"I know for a fact I'm spending more money this year,\" says Paris, an education administrator from Chicago. \"Joy makes you spend more,\" agrees her aunt, Phyllis, a special needs teacher. A pandemic-prompted sense of camaraderie and sympathy will boost their gift shopping this year, they think. But in the meantime, Paris has picked up a pair of Kate Spade shoes for herself, and Phyllis has a Ralph Lauren coat, that was 60% off at Macy's. Amazon workers plan Black Friday strikes\nNew York scrambles for plates, staff and loo roll However, not everywhere is as bustling as it could be. Along Fifth Avenue and around Soho, both fashionable shopping districts, there are noticeable numbers of empty window fronts advertising for new tenants. With city centres still partially hollowed out by people working from home, and tourism only just restarting, spending has picked up in patches. \"You have the residential areas that to me look a little bit busier than some of the midtown business areas,\" says retail expert, Dana Telsey, chief executive of the Telsey Advisory Group. And supply chain problems, which are leaving some Christmas stock stuck in transit, are affecting firms unequally too. Those problems have \"put a hinge in everything,\" says Ms Telsey. \"Overall the big players have most of what you want in,\" she says. Although lower inventories, are likely to mean shoppers find there are fewer of the really big promotions, she adds. Large retailers such as Walmart have able to use their clout with suppliers and pay for air-freighting, it hasn't been the same for smaller retailers, says Mark Mathew at the National Retail Federation. \"They don't necessarily have the buying power,\" he says. \"If you're dealing with a freight company, and you're a multi-billion dollar company, you'll have a better relationship, deeper pockets, and they're more likely to help you out in these times.\" That's certainly the experience of Karen Barwick, who set up Boomerang Toys, in the Tribeca area of downtown New York 19 years ago. The lack of city centre workers means her shop, which stocks everything from the major brands to hand-crafted wooden toys from Europe, is still much quieter than normal. And she is struggling to get hold of the full range of Lego, Jellycats, and other Christmas must-haves. Hotwheels miniature racing cars, a reliable big seller, are in limited supply. \"We have 30 different models on back-order, but there are two on the shelves,\" she says. She hasn't been able to re-order Ravensburger puzzles. They stopped accepting new orders in September she says, presumably because they knew they couldn't fulfil them. The stock she is getting in is costing a lot more too. \"We're trying not to pass it on to the consumer, but there are instances we have to,\" she says. Boomerang is still only doing around 60% of the business they were in 2019. The shop will be open on Friday, but they're not expecting a particularly busy day. \"It's not going to be a bumper year for us, but as long we get through, have a solid, steady amount of sales, then we'll be satisfied,\" she says.

            "content": "The wife of a former top Nissan executive says her husband has become \"collateral damage\" in a dispute between the company and its one-time chairman Carlos Ghosn Greg Kelly was arrested in Tokyo in November 2018 at the same time as his former boss. Both were charged with financial crimes. But while Mr Ghosn himself escaped from Japan in dramatic style, Mr Kelly now faces a possible jail sentence. For Dee Kelly, the three years since her husband's detention have been \"devastating\" for their family. At the time of his arrest, Carlos Ghosn was one of the world's best-known businessmen, and something of a celebrity in Japan. Greg Kelly had a much lower profile. He was, nonetheless, representative director of the company, a member of the Nissan board, and the right-hand man of the chairman. \"He gave 30 years of his life to that company,\" explains Dee. \"He was very dedicated. He never wanted fame or fortune, didn't want power, didn't want money - he just really wanted whatever was best for the company, Nissan.\" In November 2018, the two men flew into Japan expecting to attend an urgent board meeting. Instead they were both detained - in Carlos Ghosn's case, in a blaze of publicity. They were charged with financial crimes linked to the alleged under-reporting of the chairman's pay. Carlos Ghosn: The downfall of the god of cars\nGhosn: Decision to flee was hardest of my life\nEx-Nissan boss Ghosn: How I escaped Japan in a box Just over a year later, Mr Ghosn escaped to Lebanon - hidden in a box carried aboard a private jet. Like his arrest, his flight created headlines around the world. In a turbulent press conference, he accused people within Nissan of orchestrating his downfall, in an effort to overturn plans for a merger between the Japanese firm and its French partner Renault. Nissan denies those allegations. But once the media furore had died down, Greg Kelly became something of the forgotten man of the affair. He remains in Japan, and this year went on trial facing charges of financial misconduct, which he denies. Although he has been allowed out on bail, Dee Kelly says his detention in Japan has had a profound impact on the couple. \"When you're a young person and you lose three years of your life, it's sad, you've lost three years,\" she explains. \"When you're 62, you're not looking at much time after that down the road, and to have lost this much of our lives is pretty devastating. \"To Greg and myself, the most important thing in our lives is our family - and we have not been able to see our sons or our grandchildren for two years. Dee has recently spent time in Washington, trying to generate political and diplomatic support for her husband. \"I think he's forgotten by some, especially in the media,\" she explains. \"When Carlos Ghosn was arrested, he was one of the most famous executives in the world, not only in the automotive industry but in all industry. \"I'd say definitely he [Greg Kelly] is collateral damage. He's left behind.\" She thinks her husband's trial has become, in part, a trial by proxy of his former boss. \"I think the escape of Mr Ghosn embarrassed people in Japan - and Greg's there,\" she says. \"We would go through days of testimony, weeks of testimony, where Greg's name really didn't come up - which was kind of fascinating, since he was the defendant in the courtroom.\" A verdict is expected in a few months' time. Prosecutors want him to be jailed for two years. ",

            "header": "Entice and Orbit become latest energy firms to go bust",
            "content": "Two more energy suppliers have gone bust amid the surge in gas prices, the regulator Ofgem has said. Entice Energy and Orbit Energy, which have about 5,400 and 65,000 customers respectively, ceased trading on Wednesday. The two firms are the latest companies to go under as higher wholesale gas prices have made price promises by suppliers to customers undeliverable. Ofgem said new suppliers would be found for the two companies' customers. Households have been advised to wait until a new supplier is appointed before thinking about switching company. Neil Lawrence, director of retail at Ofgem, said:  \"I want to reassure affected customers that they do not need to worry:  under our safety net we'll make sure your energy supplies continue. \" Orbit said energy supplies to its customers were \"secure\" and said any credit balances would be honoured. What can I do if my energy supplier goes bust? The collapse of Orbit and Entice comes after Bulb, the UK's seventh largest energy supplier, was handed about £1,000 per customer from the UK government to enable it to continue supplying energy. Bulb, which has 1.7 million customers, is the largest company to date to face difficulties in recent months and was put into special administration, which will allow it keep trading for the moment with a £1.7bn loan. It will be run by an administrator until a buyer can be found or until its customers have moved. Bulb's size is the reason it has been kept afloat by the government, rather than its customers being transferred to other suppliers, as has happened with other failing energy providers. Since the beginning of September, a total of 24 energy suppliers have now failed following a spike in gas prices. \"As suppliers continue to fall like dominoes, it's clear the market is not functioning as it should and there are serious questions for Ofgem to answer about how this has been allowed to happen,\" said Gillian Cooper, head of energy policy at Citizens Advice. As a result of a cap limiting what companies can charge their customers, some businesses have been forced to sell energy for less than they bought it for, due to rising wholesale gas prices. Bigger companies tend to buy gas further in advance, which helps them avoid large hits from a price spike. However, smaller firms are less able to do and have come under pressure. Customers of Orbit and Entice will be switched to a new tariff by Ofgem and be contacted by their new supplier. The regulator has previously advised people to take a meter reading and to wait until a new supplier has been appointed before looking to switch to another energy firm. Ofgem has said that consumers will also be protected by the energy price cap, which limits how much firms can charge per unit of gas, once switched to a new tariff. Customers will still continue to receive gas or electricity even if the energy supplier goes bust. Ofgem will move your account to a new supplier, but it may take a few weeks. Your new supplier should then contact you to explain what is happening with your account\nWhile you wait to hear from your new supplier: check your current balance and - if possible - download any bills; take a photo of your meter reading\nIf you pay by direct debit, there is no need to cancel it straight away, Citizens Advice says. Wait until your new account is set up before you cancel it\nIf you are in credit, your money is protected and you'll be paid back.

            "content": "Office Christmas parties will be smaller and more suburban this year, the boss of one of the UK's biggest pub groups has predicted. Phil Urban of Mitchells & Butlers, which owns Browns, All Bar One and Harvester, told the BBC that seasonal work celebrations would be \"different\". \"We won't see so many of those big office parties booked,\" he said. After being hit during the pandemic the group has cut annual losses, but warned of soaring wage and energy costs. Mitchells & Butlers (M&B) reported a pre-tax loss of £42m for the year to 25 September, although this was an improvement on the £123m loss it posted the previous year. Total revenue at the group fell to £1.07bn from £1.48bn, while like-for-like sales fell 9.6% after the group was affected by Covid-related restrictions. However, it said that in the eight weeks since the end of its financial year, like-for-like sales were up 2.7% on pre-pandemic levels. M&B, which employs more than 40,000 people across 1,700 sites, announced 1,300 job cuts last year. Mr Urban said: \"The trading environment remains challenging and cost headwinds continue to put pressure on the sector. \"However, we have strengthened our balance sheet and returned to profitability and cash generation.\" Cocktail sales up but ales out, says Wetherspoons\nWage rises will put 30p on a pint, says pub chain\nPubs and restaurants counting on Christmas cheer Talking about Christmas parties, Mr Urban told the BBC's Today programme that bookings were coming in as \"people are recognising that actually they missed out last year\". However, he forecast: \"We might see more of the smaller groups meeting in suburbia and maybe not so much in the city centres.\" Paul Jackson, managing director at Searcys, which runs restaurants in central London and Bath, said that while there has been a steady increase in party bookings, people are delaying confirming their plans. \"We are seeing more bookings for groups for special occasions. For example, The Orangery at Blenheim Palace is ahead of its bookings from 2019,\" he said. \"But there is a reluctance to confirm large bookings straightaway, with more waiting until the last minute, which is possibly due to the slight concern for the return of restrictions.\" With more people working from home, many workers may be loathe to have to bear the cost of travelling into a city location for a work celebration, analysts suggest. \"Pub and restaurant operators traditionally thrive in December from Christmas parties,\" said Russ Mould, investment director at AJ Bell. He said nervousness on behalf of many companies could see reduced staff party volumes, particularly as Covid rates remain high. \"Managers won't want to risk employees getting ill and a lot of people still feel uneasy about mixing in a crowded room.\" ",

            "content": "A delivery company has apologised amid reports that people are facing lengthy delays receiving their passports and some have had to cancel travel plans in the run-up to Christmas. TNT, which is owned by FedEx, has an exclusive contract to deliver travel documents for the UK Passport Office. But there are reports of delivery dates being delayed multiple times, with some people still waiting after a month rather than the standard two days. Passports have also been lost. A FedEx spokesperson said: \"We fully understand the importance of these shipments to our customers and are taking additional steps to provide timely delivery by adding additional resources to the operations in the UK. \"We apologise for any inconvenience caused.\" Due to Covid backlogs, passports are already taking up to 10 weeks to process, the Passport Office (HMPO) has warned. But delays delivering the documents are adding weeks on top of this, according to complaints on Trustpilot and Twitter. One person tweeted: \"Paid nearly £300 for two urgent Fast Track passports with a guaranteed 7-day turnaround. 20 days later and nothing - Can't get through to TNT and @HM_Passport seems to have washed their hands of it. Really distressed.\" Another said: \"I have had three delivery dates and it hasn't turned up. Been on hold on the customer service phone line for nearly 3 hours yesterday. Was told it was coming today but when I checked it has now been moved to Monday.\" An online petition has been started demanding an investigation into HMPO's £77m three-year contract with TNT, signed in 2019. What are the rules for travelling abroad? It states that thousands have experienced \"significant delays\" in getting their passports delivered in recent months, and many have cancelled travel plans as a result. \"Unlike many other couriers, TNT do not seem to provide real time tracking, nor can you provide delivery instructions,\" the petition says. \"People have experienced numerous failed delivery attempts, others have had their delivery date continuously pushed back with no end in sight. Some have even had their passport or application supporting documents lost by TNT.\" It added that it was \"nearly impossible\" to get information from TNT and the Passport Office was seemingly uninterested in helping. According to the Times newspaper, HMPO is turning to alternative postal companies. Quoting a source at the department, it said that in cases where TNT had lost a passport it was re-printing the document and sending it by Royal Mail instead. FedEx blamed the delays on an increase in passport applications as Covid-19 restrictions continue to ease. \"This has resulted in a significant increase in the items to be delivered through our dedicated HMPO network,\" it said. It added that it was working closely with HMPO to ensure recipients are informed of potential extended delivery times. A HMPO spokeswoman said it expected \"the highest standards from its partners\" but that TNT was dealing with an unexpectedly high volume of applications. \"We are aware of some additional reported issues from customers related to missed deliveries by our delivery partners, and are working closely with our partners to establish the root of this issue,\" she added.

            "content": "Bulb has been handed about £1,000 per customer from the UK government to enable it to continue supplying energy. The firm was put into special administration on Wednesday, which will allow it keep trading for the moment. Bulb will be run by administrator Teneo until a buyer can be found or until its customers have moved. The government loan of nearly £1.7bn will mean the administration is managed in a way that the lights stay on for Bulb's 1.7 million customers. Teneo estimates it will cost around £2.1bn to keep Bulb trading until the end of April next year. Business Secretary Kwasi Kwarteng can provide more money for the company if needed. Without the cash, Bulb would not have been able to keep going past the middle of December, court documents show. Due to its size, Bulb will be run as normal for the time being, rather than its customers being immediately transferred to other suppliers, as has happened with other failing energy providers. By April, the cap on energy prices may have increased significantly, which would mean higher revenues for the business. The company is three times larger than any other energy supplier that has failed in recent years. What can I do if my energy supplier goes bust? Normally regulator Ofgem lets a firm fail and moves its customers to a new supplier. At the High Court in London, Justice Adam Johnson said that if left unresolved uncertainty over Bulb would be \"bound to have an effect on customers, employees and suppliers\". He said that the administration was designed \"to keep the energy supply company going, with a view to it being rescued if that is possible\". He added that an alternative would be to appoint a supplier of last resort, adding: \"That is thought to be impractical here, given the size and importance of Bulb as a supplier\". The judge said that the £1.7bn would be \"of existential importance to Bulb\". Earlier in the day, Mr Kwarteng said the special administration regime was a temporary arrangement to provide \"an ultimate safety net to protect consumers and ensure continued supply\". He told the House of Commons: \"We do not want this company to be in this temporary state longer than is absolutely necessary.\" For Labour, shadow business secretary Ed Miliband said: \"With so many companies going bust in just two months, something not happening anywhere else in the world, it points to a systemic failure of regulation. \"Firms took risky bets and were allowed to do so and the government and Ofgem significantly deregulated the conditions of operation in 2016. Mr Miliband called for \"a proper external review of the regulation of the market\". As a result of a cap limiting what companies can charge their customers, some businesses have been forced to sell energy for less than they bought it for. Bigger companies tend to buy their gas further in advance, helping them avoid large hits from the price spike. However smaller firms that are less able to do that have come under pressure. Since the beginning of September, 22 energy suppliers have failed following a spike in gas prices. Labour MP Alex Sobel said: \"We're moving back to an oligopoly of energy companies who are increasing their profits whilst the supplier of last resort is socialising losses. Mr Kwarteng replied: \"I've always maintained that competition is absolutely essential in this market. \"What's happened is there's been a huge mismatch between the wholesale price and the retail price cap, and the retail price cap is there to protect consumers.\" Liberal Democrat MP Layla Moran suggested a \"Northern Rock-style energy company to take on customers of companies that have gone under\" if the current process is not working. Consumer group Which? said the support \"should provide reassurance\" to Bulb customers. \"We recommend Bulb customers to do nothing and wait for more information about the special administration process,\" said Which? home products and services editor Lisa Barber. \"Its customers will continue to see their bills limited by the price cap, which is likely to be the best deal for them at the moment. \"There are few savings to be made by switching and some suppliers are not taking on new customers due to high wholesale gas prices,\" she added.

Wardpark Studios in Cumbernauld has been bought by Hackman Capital Partners and Square Mile Capital Management. Located on a 14-acre former warehouse site, Wardpark is the largest film studio in Scotland. Wardpark CEO Terry Thomson said the deal will help \"further establish\" Scotland as one of the global hubs for the production of film and TV dramas. He added: \"The demand is unstoppable but we have to compete in a global market to attract inward productions. It is my intention to now expand our investments in the Scottish screen sector.\" Wardpark is currently home to the sixth season of the hit TV series Outlander and all previous seasons have also been filmed at the campus. The Wardpark staff will remain unchanged, according to a press release issued to announce the sale. Executive Director of Screen Scotland, Isabel Davis, said the studio has been a \"phenomenal training ground\" for the country's screen sector. She added: \"Wardpark Studios has led the surge in production from Scotland for many years now and remains at the forefront. \"It's great to see that Terry's success story has caught the attention of a global player.\" Michael Hackman, founder of Hackman Capital Partners, added: \"Wardpark has been a strong catalyst for growth in the country's creative sector and Scotland has become an important filming destination for international content creators.\" Hackman and its affiliate The MBS Group have 65 studio locations in their portfolio across six countries including MBS Media Campus and Sony Pictures Animation Studios in California. It comes at a productive time for the TV and film industry in Scotland, as a number of Amazon Prime series are filmed in the country. They include a TV adaptation of Neil Gaiman's fantasy novel Anansi Boys, which is due to be shot at First Stage Studios in Leith. ",

            "content": "India is set to go ahead with its plan to ban most cryptocurrencies in the country under a long-awaited bill. Expectations had grown in recent months that the government may soften its view on digital currencies. The ban would relate to all private cryptocurrencies with certain exceptions to allow the promotion of the underlying technology and its uses. Cryptocurrency prices dropped on Indian exchanges after the decision on the bill's future was announced. According to a government bulletin, the ban is part of the proposed Cryptocurrency and Regulation of Official Digital Currency Bill that will be introduced in its winter session. The planned legislation aims \"to create a facilitative framework for the creation of the official digital currency to be issued by the Reserve Bank of India (RBI)\". The plan to prohibit all private cryptocurrencies appeared to be essentially the same as an earlier draft of the bill submitted in January. In recent months it was thought the government may soften its stance on cryptocurrencies, possibly seeking to have them regulated as assets instead of a means of payment. While the description of the bill has remained the same, the exact differences have yet to be confirmed because the latest draft is not yet publicly available. The value of several digital currencies reportedly dropped following the announcement of the bill. Bitcoin fell more than 13% on the Indian exchange site WazirX, while Shiba Inu and Dogecoin both dropped more than 15%. However, Glen Goodman, author of The Crypto Trader, told the BBC's World Business Report radio programme that the global impact was \"relatively small\". \"Even when China decided to ban cryptocurrency - and that was a really big deal - it didn't completely massacre the crypto markets,\" he said. According to a video report by local news publication India Today, cryptocurrency trading is likely to continue under the proposed bill, as long as users buy from exchanges which meet certain requirements. The report added that the bill may focus on restricting who is allowed to create cryptocurrencies, with the aim of protecting investors. According to the CoinDesk website, the RBI, the country's central bank, is regarded as having conservative views about cryptocurrency. In March 2020, India's supreme court overturned a digital currency trading ban imposed by RBI for two years. And last week, RBI governor Shaktikanta Das said the bank had \"serious concerns from the point of view of macro-economic and financial stability\", and that blockchain technology can thrive without cryptocurrencies. However Mr Goodman pointed to the recent ban in China, and El Salvador's plan to build a Bitcoin city at the base of a volcano with the cryptocurrency used to fund the project. \"Governments take very different approaches to how they see it,\" he said. \"As a threat, an opportunity, or somewhere in-between.\" Mr Goodman said the Chinese government wants to get rid of all digital currencies except the one it is creating. \"They want to dominate cryptocurrencies, and it seems to me like the Indian government has got the same idea. \"They think, 'well if China is doing it, then so can we'.\" ",

            "content": "An attempt by oil importers to force down the price has not had much impact, and can only ever be short term - handing power to exporters when they meet next week\nThe politics and economics of energy is also putting further upward pressure on gas prices, as a reminder of a big British price hike next spring\nSupply shortages make the case for more drilling, according to the UK industry regulator, but there's also a warning to drillers that public support could run dry As Americans head home for Thanksgiving on crowded interstates, the cost of filling up that vast SUV is hurting. And President Joe Biden feels their pain. He has failed to persuade the Organisation of Oil Exporting Countries (OPEC), along with Russia (OPEC+), to respond to rising demand as the world economy gets back into growth post-pandemic. They only narrowly got to an agreement at their last meeting. Even if they weren't enjoying the higher revenue and discomfort for political adversaries around the world, exporters cannot turn the taps on or off as fast as the American political calendar requires it. So the Biden administration co-ordinated action by the big oil importers on Tuesday, boosting supply of crude oil by saying it will release it into the market from strategic stocks. On a given level of demand, that should reduce its price. It didn't go to plan. The market responded by pushing the spot price up by nearly $3 a barrel, so that it currently trades above $82. It seems that oil traders had already priced in some release of stocks, helping the price to drift below $80 a barrel from highs earlier in autumn. They're making assumptions on the future path of demand, further complicated by new waves of Covid infection and potential social and economic restrictions. The schedule on which the stocks get released was unclear. The US may simply bring forward sale of stock rather than adding to production. Others including China and India, while willing to show support for Biden's initiative, don't hold a Strategic Petroleum Reserve on anything like the scale of the US one. The UK joined in by asking oil producers to release roughly a day's UK production into the market. Analysts expected things to ease by around February. According to Louise Dickson, an oil market analyst with Rystad Energy, said: \"The release may be a case of too much too late, as the oil market was tightest and needed supply relief in September\". For students of economics, this an interesting example of market power. Even the world's biggest economies and biggest oil consumers cannot co-ordinate their use of stocks to thwart an export cartel and determine the price. With an OPEC+ meeting scheduled for next week, there's a real prospect the cartel could match the extra supply of crude oil by cutting exports. That would leave importers in little doubt about who holds the power. While importers with stocks can afford to make one big gesture, exporters have much, much deeper reserves with which to sustain their market power. There are further complications. Reducing the price of crude oil is no guarantee that it will be refined and made available to consumers in the forecourt. And the high price of natural gas for heating is shifting the oil market in favour of the sweet, light variety that can be refined for that by-product, with less demand for the sour variety that usually dominates trading. And that brings us to the problems of the natural gas industry. With tensions rising between Russia and Ukraine, linked to German moves to delay approval of the new Nordstream pipeline that Russia wants to open, geopolitics has again pushed up the spot price, by more than 15% in two days. It had been drifting down from early October highs, though remained far above levels earlier this year. For British bill-payers, who are protected for now by a price cap on household energy, the new upward trend is another reminder of the pain that will hit them when that cap is raised. That's currently scheduled for next April, but such is the pressure on energy suppliers paying wholesale rates while charging their customers far less, the frequency of reviewing the price cap could be increased as well. Without that review coming forward, this week's move into special administration by Bulb Energy was the one that the industry feared and also expected. As the seventh biggest supplier in Britain, it is too big for other companies to absorb, so it will take UK government action and perhaps a lot of public funds to keep it going. The cost of recouping that loss is also likely to land on bill-payers. All this seems a long way from the COP26 summit, when President Biden and many others were agreeing that oil and gas have to shrink massively, and not talking about supplying the market with more crude oil to help keep prices down. It's also a long way also from the pressure on the UK government to stop consent from new drilling and enhanced production. Under short-term pressure, political leaders are likely to favour lower prices over lower emissions. Ahead of the decision on whether to green light the Cambo gas field, west of Shetland, another significant voice is calling for continued drilling by the oil and gas industry in UK waters. Tim Eggar used to be energy minister in the Conservative government of the 1990s. He is now chairman of the Oil and Gas Authority (OGA). At a conference in London on Wednesday, he had two key messages. Following petrol shortages and with gas prices soaring: \"Security of supply is back in vogue\". The need for oil and gas to fuel transport, industry and heating will remain \"for the foreseeable future,\" he said. And so, he argued, it's better to produce it in UK waters, with lower emissions than arise from transporting it from other countries. But in a speech to the industry, there was another warning message worth noting - that the transition deal struck between government and industry, to reduce its carbon footprint very rapidly, is one that companies will have to adhere to. \"Industry's social licence to operate is barely holding,\" observed Mr Eggar. \"Failure to deliver the transition deal is not an option. \"These emissions targets should be viewed as the absolute minimum. Industry should look to smash these targets, not just meet them.\" The OGA regulator will \"hold industry to account on their side of the bargain by very closely tracking, monitoring and reporting on progress\".

            "content": "Insurer LV= has been accused of \"a number of shortcomings\" in keeping customers informed about its potential sale to a US private equity firm. Martin Shaw, chief executive of the Association of Financial Mutuals (AFM), told MPs it was vital that mutuals told members about changing strategies. He said the decision to sell LV was \"sad\", but \"consistent with the challenges within the business\". The proposed £530m takeover by Bain Capital has led to a backlash. LV=, founded in 1843 and formerly known as Liverpool Victoria, would lose its mutual status if the sale goes through. On Monday, just a few weeks before the voting deadline, LV= sent out a detailed analysis to its 1.2 million members explaining why it believed the Bain deal was best, having rebuffed an approach from a rival, Royal London. Insurer LV= appeals to members over £530m bid\nBoss of insurer LV= defends sale amid backlash Mr Shaw told MPs on the Treasury Committee: \"I think there were a number of shortcomings in the approach and I am sure that if the directors had their time again, they would improve the quality of communication throughout.\" He described the plight of LV= as a \"three-Act tragedy\". He said it invested in its general insurance business, knowing that the life insurance and pensions arm was shrinking, but then realising \"too late in the day that it was not the panacea they were hoping for\". It sold the general insurance business, but that did not stem the initial problem. Other mutuals had solved similar issues, said Mr Shaw, who is in charge of the trade body that represents mutual and not-for-profit insurers, friendly societies and other mutuals in the UK. LV= members would be given £100 each as part of the Bain Capital deal, and with-profit members would receive more. MPs were told that bonuses paid at the point of demutualisation were usually far outweighed by lower investment returns in the future, and a lower level of customer service. On Monday, LV= said that it would require significant investment from members for it to remain as a standalone business. \"It would not be fair for us to ask our with-profit members to finance a future that requires significant investment, which many would not benefit from,\" said David Barral, senior independent director of LV=. The Treasury Committee held a one-off session about the state of the mutual sector from major figures in the industry including building societies and credit unions. The committee also heard that building societies were facing stiff competition from banks in selling mortgages, owing to the financial effects of the pandemic. Around £170bn was saved into current accounts, savings accounts and business accounts as a result of individuals spending less during the pandemic, and firms receiving financial support from the government. Mike Regnier, chief executive of the Yorkshire Building Society, said that ring-fenced retail banks wanted to lend out that money as mortgages, so pushed down interest rates to gain customers. He said that it would take many years for that extra cash to filter through the system. Building societies account for 23% of the mortgage market in the UK, and 18% of the savings sector. ",

            "content": "Apple's much promoted digital driver's licence feature is now to be delayed to early 2022. Announced in September, the scheme will allow residents in eight US states to store state IDs and driver's licences inside the Apple Wallet app on their iPhone. The delay follows Apple's announcement it was looking for \"sole control\" over how states rolled out the feature. Reports have stated the new feature will come at a cost to the taxpayer. The delay was first noticed on an update to Apple's iOS 15 page, by technology website MacRumors. Apple has not provided a specific release date for the feature beyond the early 2022 timeframe. And there is conflicting information on the company's site, with the software's All New Features page still stating the ID feature is coming in \"late 2021\". BBC News has asked Apple for comment. Arizona, and Georgia will introduce the system first, with Connecticut, Iowa, Kentucky, Maryland, Oklahoma, and Utah also signed up. Apple has said it is in discussions with other US states - reportedly including Florida - as it works to offer the feature, announced at a presentation in June, nationwide in the future. The \"first locations\" to use the system will be airport-security checkpoints run by the Transportation Security Administration (TSA), Apple says. Some users had expressed privacy concerns about handing over smartphones to police or security officials. And Apple now says users do not need to unlock or hand over their phones for the system to work for airport security. But it remains unclear if or how it might eventually work for other uses of ID, such as drivers stopped by police. ",

            "content": "Several stallholders at a town's market said they were quitting rather than moving to a £4.7m replacement facility. Some traders in Great Yarmouth, many of whom have been operating for generations, said the new covered stalls being built were too small. The borough council said its new canopied market, partly on the same site, would be \"a more attractive place for shoppers\". The first phase of the market is expected to open in January. Brewer's Chip Saloon will have served the town for 120 years in 2022 and owner, Robin Platten, said the council had not listened to traders. \"We always asked for space. We just needed something that was fit for purpose, for us to fit our equipment into,\" he said. For 75 years Barrie's Tea Stall has been serving drinks and hot snacks. Mel Wilson, who took over the stall 17 years ago with husband Jimmy, said they would shut for good on Christmas Eve. \"It's not how we wanted to go. We would have loved to have embraced the market and everything, but what we're being offered is just awful compared to what we've already got,\" she said. \"It's a shame as they're going to rip the heart out of the town centre.\" Blake's Butchers was founded 100 years ago and Philip Blake, 63, said the shorter one-year leases being offered would lead to \"fly-by-night\" stallholders. \"Not being funny, but I think they'll be selling little bits and pieces, and like Norwich market, next time you go, it's gone,\" he said. He said he was the fourth generation of his family to work on the stall and he would probably retire now. In a statement, Great Yarmouth Borough Council said: \"Our new market place is designed to be a more attractive place for shoppers to come to, and we are pleased that the majority of current stallholders have decided to stay with us. \"We know a handful of stalls have decided that the move isn't for them and we will be sorry to see them go, but the majority of traders choosing to remain will enjoy long-term leases for the first time and a much more pleasant environment for them and their customers.\" Find BBC News: East of England on Facebook, Instagram and Twitter.

            "header": "Apple sues Israeli spyware firm NSO Group",
            "content": "Apple is suing Israeli spyware firm NSO Group and its parent company for allegedly targeting iPhone users with a hacking tool. NSO's Pegasus software can infect both iPhones and Android devices, allowing operators to extract messages, photos and emails, record calls and secretly activate microphones and cameras. NSO Group said its tools were made to target terrorists and criminals. But it has allegedly also been used on activists, politicians and journalists. NSO Group says it only supplies Pegasus to military, law enforcement and intelligence agencies from countries with good human-rights records. However earlier this month, US officials placed the company on a trade blacklist, saying the software had \"enabled foreign governments to conduct transnational repression, which is the practice of authoritarian governments targeting dissidents, journalists and activists\". Apple's move follows a lawsuit launched in 2019 by WhatsApp which is still working its way through the US court system. In its initial court filing, WhatsApp said NSO Group \"developed their malware in order to access messages and other communications after they were decrypted on target devices\". Other tech firms, including Microsoft, Meta Platforms (formerly Facebook), Google-owner Alphabet and Cisco Systems have all previously criticised NSO. NSO Group: Israeli spyware company added to US trade blacklist\nPegasus spyware seller: Blame our customers, not us, for hacking In a blog post announcing the California lawsuit, Apple said it wanted to hold NSO Group and its parent company OSY Technologies \"accountable for the surveillance and targeting of Apple users\". \"To prevent further abuse and harm to its users, Apple is also seeking a permanent injunction to ban NSO Group from using any Apple software, services, or devices,\" it said. Apple prides itself on its privacy. It's a major selling point for its devices. So it's not totally surprising that a company that has allegedly sought to bypass Apple security features might antagonise the giant. That's not the only reason Apple is making a stand though. Not all hackers are considered equals. NSO Group has government clients, or as Apple puts it, is \"state-sponsored\". NSO claims it only works with agencies with good human rights records. In that way the company has tried to distinguish itself from underground hackers doing nefarious activities. By suing NSO Group Apple is rejecting that distinction. Apple is making the point that it doesn't matter who you are, if you're a group trying to hack into an Apple product they'll take action - whatever the motives. But there's a bit more depth to it than that. Apple will feel it's easier, and more politically palatable, to sue a private company, rather than the governments who are allegedly using the tech. In its complaint, filed in the US District Court for the Northern District of California, Apple said NSO's tools were used in \"concerted efforts in 2021 to target and attack Apple customers\" and that \"US citizens have been surveilled by NSO's spyware on mobile devices that can and do cross international borders.\" Apple alleged that NSO group created more than 100 fake Apple ID user credentials to carry out its attacks. The tech giant said that its servers were not hacked, but that NSO misused and manipulated the servers to deliver the attacks on Apple users. Apple also alleged that NSO Group was directly involved in providing consulting services for the spyware, but NSO maintains that it only sells its tools to clients. Apple said it was forced to engage in a continual arms race with NSO, saying the Israeli firm was \"constantly updating their malware and exploits to overcome Apple's own security upgrades\". The iPhone maker said that it will donate $10m, as well as any damages recovered in the lawsuit, to cybersurveillance research groups including Citizen Lab, the University of Toronto group that first discovered NSO's attacks. NSO Group said in response: \"Thousands of lives were saved around the world thanks to NSO Group's technologies used by its customers\". \"Paedophiles and terrorists can freely operate in technological safe-havens, and we provide governments with the lawful tools to fight [them]. \"NSO group will continue to advocate for the truth.\" ",

            "content": "People being treated for mental health difficulties should be routinely directed to financial support, a charity has urged. The pandemic pushed a host of people into a cycle of debt, many of whom were unable to access Covid support measures, the Money and Mental Health Policy Institute said. It estimates that 2.5 million people considered suicide as a result. Signposting for money matters could be provided by GPs and banks, it said. People in problem debt get 60-day break scheme\n'Impulse buying led me to buy a car I didn't need' The charity said that mental health issues could lead to reduced concentration or memory problems, which made it difficult to manage money in general. These challenges were compounded during the pandemic by loss of income and employment, poor health, and issues with benefits payments. Rob is one of those whose situation worsened during the pandemic. \"There was no social connection. Therapy moved online and I couldn't see my family who are a huge source of support. The year has been horrendous, you can have suicidal thoughts and think: 'If I did something no-one would know',\" he said. The 55-year-old went on to explain how rising energy bills created further problems. \"When you spend more on heating, and don't have the money to spend on other stuff, there are limitations. \"I've had to deal with an increase in food prices. I had to find out what times the supermarkets put out the discounted food. The fact that you have to go to the shops at a certain time to get the discounted food makes you feel ashamed,\" he said \"Shame is a big thing that leads to anxiety and depression, then you don't want to get out of bed, you don't want to eat - it spirals.\" A survey for the institute suggested that 37% of people with mental health problems were behind on at least one payment in the previous year compared with 14% of those without mental health problems. One in four had no savings that they could use for an urgent or emergency expense. Martin Lewis, of Money Saving Expert, who founded the charity, said: \"The pandemic financially split the nation. Many gained - those who had support and lower costs often built up savings. \"Yet for others, it was catastrophic, and it is a national tragedy that a disproportionate number of that group are those struggling with their mental health who missed out on the support they need to avoid reaching crisis point. \"Government, health professionals and essential services need to double down on efforts to stop people with mental health problems falling further into financial hardship. Prevention is better, and in the long run cheaper for the nation, than cure.\" For more information and support visit the BBC Action Line STING - 'IS THAT MY DESTINY?': The 100 million selling artist on family and fame\nIN PRISON WITH NELSON MANDELA: Fellow inmate Ahmed Kathrada speaks about being imprisoned under the Apartheid regime ",

            "header": "Universal credit boost for workers takes effect",
            "content": "Budget changes that boost the income of some working people on universal credit come into force from now, the government has announced. Workers will now take home 8p more of any extra pound earned, owing to a shift in the so-called taper rate. Chancellor Rishi Sunak said in October's Budget that the change would take effect \"within weeks\" and no later than December 1. The policy was announced amid debate over the benefit's suitability. About two million people will benefit by an average of £1,000 following the move, the government said. However, the Resolution Foundation think tank calculated that 3.6 million families will remain worse off because the alterations failed to offset the loss of a £20 a week uplift in universal credit provided during the pandemic. Most universal credit claimants lose some of their benefits if they earn more money. The rate at which they lose the benefits is known as the taper rate. From now, the taper rate is 55%, which means that if you earn an extra pound you lose 55p in benefits. Previously, the rate was 63%, so workers will now take home 8p more of an extra £1 earned. Workers with responsibility for children or disabilities that limit their ability to work are allowed to earn a certain amount before they start losing their universal credit, which is called a work allowance. The work allowances for eligible claimants has also now gone up by £500 a year. Read more: Universal credit: What is the taper rate? They include two million households which are dependant on benefits and have nobody in work. Mr Sunak had been under pressure from MPs, including some Conservatives, about the withdrawal in October of the temporary £20-a-week universal credit uplift, and its effect on the finances of financially-stretched families. In the Budget, he announced the move to reward those who worked and earned more, while still on universal credit. The chancellor said on Wednesday: \"These changes come into force today and will mean that with Christmas approaching, hard-working families keeping an extra £1,000 a year of what they earn.\" The Department for Work and Pensions is encouraging people to check online benefit calculators to work out how their income could be boosted. The changes mean that an extra 600,000 families, all in work, will become entitled to some universal credit payments, according to economists at the Institute for Fiscal Studies (IFS). That takes the total to seven million, or 26% of working-age families. Eight ways the Budget affects you and your money\nMillions of poor families hit, Budget analysis finds\nThe universal credit claimants paying top tax rates The result was that those who were earning a significant income, perhaps even at the level of a higher-rate taxpayer, might still be entitled to some help through universal credit, said Tom Waters, senior research economist at the IFS. For example, a lone parent with two children and monthly rent of £750 can now earn up to £51,900 a year before losing all of their universal credit entitlement. \"Along with other recent reforms, it means that 2.7 million working households on benefits will be better off than under the 2015 tax and benefit system,\" said Mr Waters. \"However, 2.1 million will still be worse off as will almost all two million benefit dependent working age households with nobody in work.\" The changes to universal credit take effect to a backdrop of the rising cost of living - with the inflation rate expected to peak next year - and tax increases in April. That would negate any wage rises experienced particularly by middle-income earners. Low-income households would also feel \"real pain\" as the cost of living is set to increase faster than benefit payments, the IFS has said.

            "content": "America's three largest pharmacies have been found to be liable for helping fuel a painkiller crisis in two Ohio counties, in a landmark case. A federal court found that actions by Walgreens Boots Alliance, CVS, and Walmart helped create an oversupply of addictive opioid pills. The scale of compensation, to be paid to the two Ohio counties, will be decided at a future hearing. CVS said it would appeal against the judgement. The other retailers, who all contested the cases, did not immediately comment. Over the last two decades, millions of Americans have become addicts through over-prescription and abuse of legal opiate-based painkillers such as Fentanyl and OxyContin. Nearly 500,000 deaths were attributed to painkiller overdoses between 1999 and 2019. Local and state governments say the painkiller epidemic put huge strain on their resources as they tried to tackle it through social programmes and the legal system. There are around 3,300 other cases being brought in an attempt to recoup some of those costs from firms that profited from the sales of the painkillers. US drug overdose deaths hit record levels\nSacklers win immunity from further opioid litigation\nOpioid crisis: US drug giants reach $26bn settlement As well as the pharmacy chains, big pharmaceutical companies and medical professionals have been accused of turning a blind eye to the problem. Lawyers for the two Ohio counties, Lake and Trumbull, said the costs are potentially $1bn for each county, to cover social and legal expenses related to the impact of the opioid epidemic. \"The judgement today against Walmart, Walgreens and CVS represents the overdue reckoning for their complicity in creating a public nuisance,\" they said in a joint statement. They argued that the pharmacies created a public nuisance by failing to ensure opioid prescriptions were valid allowing excessive quantities of addictive pain pills to flood their communities. Walgreens Boots Alliance, CVS and Walmart denied the allegations, saying they had taken steps to prevent painkillers being diverted from their intended legal use. CVS in a statement said it strongly disagreed with the verdict and would appeal. \"As plaintiffs' own experts testified, many factors have contributed to the opioid abuse issue, and solving this problem will require involvement from all stakeholders in our healthcare system and all members of our community,\" CVS said. Other cases around the country are relying on the \"public nuisance\" argument to target the companies involved in making and distributing the opioid painkillers. However earlier this month courts in Oklahoma and California rejected it as a legal argument in cases against drugs makers. ",

            "content": "The US has said it is releasing 50 million barrels of oil from its reserves in an attempt to bring down soaring energy and petrol prices. The move is being taken in parallel with other major oil-consuming nations, including China, India, Japan, South Korea and the UK. US President Joe Biden has repeatedly asked the Opec group of oil-producing nations to boost output more rapidly. But Opec has stuck to an agreement to only increase production gradually. It says it is concerned that a resurgence of coronavirus cases could drive down demand, as happened at the height of the pandemic. Crude oil prices recently touched seven-year highs, amid a sharp uptick in global demand as economies recover from the coronavirus crisis. It's driven up petrol prices and energy bills in many countries. In a statement the White House said: \"American consumers are feeling the impact of elevated gas prices at the pump and in their home heating bills, and American businesses are, too, because oil supply has not kept up with demand. \"That's why President Biden is using every tool available to him to work to lower prices and address the lack of supply.\" As part of the coordinated effort, the UK government will allow firms to voluntarily release 1.5 million barrels of oil from privately-held reserves. It said the action would support the global economic recovery but \"any benefit for UK drivers is likely to be limited and short in nature\". India will release five million barrels, while South Korea, Japan and China will announce the amount and timing of their releases in due course. Officials said it was the first time that the US had coordinated such a move with some of the world's largest oil consumers. But analysts questioned whether it would have much impact. \"It's not large enough to bring down prices in a meaningful way and may even backfire if it prompts Opec+ [which includes Russia] to slow the pace at which it is raising output,\" said Caroline Bain, chief commodities economist at Capital Economics. But the effort by Washington to team up with other major economies to lower energy prices sends a warning to Opec and other big producers that they need to address concerns about high crude prices, which are up more than 50% this year. Opec+, which includes major producers such as Saudi Arabia and Russia, has repeatedly rebuffed requests to pump more oil at its monthly meetings, causing frustration in the US. \"We will continue talking to international partners on this issue,\" a senior US administration official told reporters on Tuesday. \"The president stands ready to take additional action if needed, and is prepared to use his full authorities working in coordination with the rest of the world.\" Carsten Fritsch, a Commerzbank analyst, said the move may lead to Opec+ rethinking its strategy and agreeing to increase output at a meeting next week. \"To put things into perspective, 50 million barrels is equivalent to a production hike by 1.6 million barrels per day for one month or by 1 million barrels per day for seven weeks. This is quite significant.\" However, Caroline Bain, chief commodities analyst a Capital Economics, said the release was \"not large enough to bring down prices in a meaningful way and may even backfire if it prompts Opec+ to slow the pace at which it is raising output\". \"As such, it seems quite symbolic and politically motivated,\" she said. She added that the move \"also seems a bit impatient\" with the consensus among analysts being that if Opec+ continues to pump more oil, the market will move into surplus in the first quarter next year. This \"would naturally bring down oil prices,\" Ms Bain said. ",

He made the remarks during a visit to Homerton College at Cambridge University and said he had tried to support the issue for much of his life. During his visit to to the city he also opened AstraZeneca's £1bn global Research and Development facility at the Cambridge Biomedical Campus. He also spoke with traders at Cambridge Market. At Homerton College, Prince Charles, who was met by the college's principal, Lord Woolley, said: \"I could not be more pleased to hear about the excellent work being carried out to promote greater inclusion and diversity. \"As Lord Woolley knows, this is a subject which has always been close to my heart, and which I have sought to take forward, and to support, as much as possible much of my life. \"For our society to meet successfully the huge challenges before us, we will need all our talents and all our contributions. \"That is not simply a good intention - it is the most profound good sense.\" \"I have said before that our diversity is our greatest strength, and I become ever more convinced of that truth as time goes by and as I see fresh examples of that principle - as I do so clearly here today.\" The prince held a private meeting with Lord Woolley, who is also an equalities campaigner and the founder of Operation Black Vote. He became the first black man to lead an Oxbridge college after taking up his post last month. He previously collaborated with the Prince's Trust on addressing disadvantage among people from ethnic minorities. He also attended a session on \"Get In Cambridge\" to discuss access to education and learn of the college's vision to welcome and support students from diverse backgrounds. In March, the Duke and Duchess of Sussex, in an interview with US talk show host Oprah Winfrey, accused an unnamed member of the royal family of making a racist remark about their son, Archie, before he was born. In the aftermath, the Duke of Cambridge defended the monarchy against accusations of racism, saying: \"We're very much not a racist family.\" Opening AstraZeneca's new £1bn Discovery Centre research facility, the prince was told how the firm had supplied more than two billion doses of its Covid-19 vaccine. The new centre, on the campus which also contains Addenbrooke's and Royal Papworth NHS hospitals and GlaxoSmithKline's Experimental Medicine and Clinical Pharmacology Unit, will accommodate more than 2,200 scientists, \"I must say it has been absolutely fascinating to see at least some of the work that takes place inside this centre and to think that - supported by interactions across the city and beyond - it will ultimately enhance and save the lives of untold millions of people around the world in the years and decades to come,\" said the heir to the throne. Earlier in the day he visited Cambridge's city centre market, taking time to talk with stallholders and shake the hands of some of the hundreds of people who came to see him, from behind barriers which circled the markets place during his visit.

            "content": "Italy's competition watchdog has fined Amazon and Apple more than €200m (£168m) for allegedly flouting competition regulations. The fine relates to Beats headphones, a brand bought by Apple for $3bn (£1.8bn at the time) in 2014. A 2018 agreement between the tech giants meant only selected resellers could sell the products on Amazon's Italian website. Both Apple and Amazon said they plan to appeal against the fines. The Italian Competition Authority said the actions of the two companies also violated European Union rules, and affected competition on pricing. It ordered the two companies to end the restrictions and give resellers access in a \"non-discriminatory manner.\" Apple said it respected the watchdog's decision, \"but believe we have done nothing wrong.\" Teaming up with selected resellers helps customer safety because it ensures products are genuine, Apple said. \"Non-genuine products deliver an inferior experience and can often be dangerous,\" said its spokesperson. \"To ensure our customers purchase genuine products, we work closely with our reseller partners and have dedicated teams of experts around the world who work with law enforcement, customs and merchants, to ensure only genuine Apple products are being sold.\" Amazon said it strongly disagreed with the decision of the Italian authority, and that its share of the proposed fine (€68.7m) was \"disproportionate and unjustified\". A spokesperson for the company said: \"We reject the suggestion that Amazon benefits by excluding sellers from our store, since our business model relies on their success. It said the agreement at issue \"more than doubled\" the catalogue of products available to Italian customers, and resulted in \"better deals and faster shipping\". ",

            "content": "Online electricals retailer AO World has warned Xbox and Playstation games devices, and iPhones could be in short supply this Christmas. A global shortage of computer chips has hit availability of such items. AO warned that these shortages as well as supply chain problems in the festive trading period would hit its profits. The retailer saw sales soar during lockdown, but that runaway growth has been halted by higher labour and transport costs. AO warned that the key festive trading period would be \"significantly softer\" than anticipated. On Tuesday, the firm posted a half-year pre-tax loss of £10m, down from an £18m profit in the six months last year. That sent AO's share price crashing by about 25% initially on Tuesday, although it had recovered slightly to stand about 15% lower by late morning. The nationwide lorry driver shortage that has hit many companies remains a problem, AO said. It had recruited about 500 new drivers to help beat labour shortages, but said it was still seeing \"meaningful supply chain challenges\", product shortages and higher costs of transport and freight. Tech retailers warn of low Black Friday stock\nIkea to raise prices as supply problems bite\nWhy is there an HGV driver shortage? \"At the start of our financial year in April, we planned for continued revenue growth and built up our cost base accordingly,\" AO said. \"However, since then, growth in the UK has been impacted by the nationwide shortage of delivery drivers and the ongoing disruption in the global supply chain, and the German online market has seen significantly increased competition. \"As we now look to the second half, we continue to see meaningful supply chain challenges with poor availability in certain categories, particularly in our newer products where we have less scale, experience and leverage.\" In addition, shipping costs, the cost of materials and consumer price inflation \"remain challenging uncertainties\", the company said. Many companies - from toy, food and clothes retailers to furniture giant Ikea - have warned of labour shortages, higher costs and disruption to supplies. At the weekend, technology retailers warned that they may have insufficient stock to meet Black Friday demand due to delays in the supply chain. AO World, which sells a diverse range of electrical goods, including laptops, washing machines, and mobile phones, said the \"all-important\" festive period would be far tougher than it anticipated just a few weeks ago. It expects underlying profits for the year to March of between £10m-£20m compared with a previous forecast of between £35m-£50m issued in October. Profits last year nearly tripled to £64m. Richard Hunter, head of markets at online share broker Interactive Investor, called AO's problems a \"white-knuckle ride\". In addition to supply problems and staff shortages in the UK, he pointed to issues overseas. \"The group's foray into the German market is not only in the early stages of establishing the brand, but is also being faced by significantly increased competition,\" he said. The fall in AO's share price, which now stands at about 105p, will prove continuing disappointment for staff, who in 2020 were offered a generous bonus scheme. Employees would share £140m if the price hit £9.41 by 2025, and £240m if it went to £12.55. AO's highest closing price is about £4.30, reached in January. In October, the government introduced special temporary work visas to attract more foreign workers to the UK. ",

Luton Rising, a Luton Borough Council company that owns London Luton Airport, has agreed with its operator, London Luton Airport Operations, that it can retain the money over three years. The agreement will support the airport's recovery from the pandemic. In a joint statement the companies said it would \"provide certainty\" for those who rely on the airport for employment. Alberto Martin, chief executive of London Luton Airport Operations, said the deal \"creates reassurance for the thousands of people and the many local businesses who rely on us through the supply chain\". The operator will \"retain £45m over a three-year period from past and future passenger income that would have been due to Luton Rising had passenger numbers not reduced\", the statement said. As part of the airport's recovery from the impacts of coronavirus, the operator has committed to \"delivering the real living wage for all its direct employees during 2022, and the reintroduction of a dedicated taxi rank for local Hackney Carriage drivers\". Luton Rising and London Luton Airport Operations Ltd will also work on \"ambitious sustainability and net zero strategies\", the statement said. Graham Olver, chief executive of Luton Rising, said: \"This agreement sets out how we will continue to work together over the coming decade to build back better, stronger and greener, and support the vital economic and employment recovery that we will want to see in the supply chain and across the region. \"Importantly for Luton residents, this has also been achieved with no direct impact on council tax, and continues to protect the vital investment we make every year in voluntary and community services to improve people's lives.\" Find BBC News: East of England on Facebook, Instagram and Twitter.

            "content": "A trend for longer-term fixed-rate mortgages is set to test homeowners' appetite for certainty over cost - but brokers warn risks will still remain. On Tuesday, Kensington Mortgages launched a mortgage product with a rate that can be fixed for up to 40 years. Borrowers already have a choice of long-term fixes beyond the traditional two-year deals, with scores of 10-year products available. Brokers say the benefits are clear, but such products are unsuitable for many. Slow rise from ultra-low mortgage rates predicted Kensington is a non-bank mortgage provider and is able to offer the new product with the backing of Rothesay, a huge pensions insurance specialist. It said that borrowers could fix their rate for anything between 11 and 40 years, with the cost dependant on the length of repayment and the size of the loan compared to the value of the home. Applicants must not be older than 70 at the end of the mortgage term. Online lender Habito also launched a deal for up to 40 years earlier this year. Borrowers, aware of the historically low mortgage rates, have been applying for longer-term fixed-rate deals, but these have commonly been five-year deals. Lenders are now also offering a selection of 158 different 10-year products, according to financial information service Moneyfacts, amid expectations that the Bank rate will rise soon. \"A [longer] fixed-for-term mortgage - already very popular in some parts of continental Europe - is likely to become increasingly attractive in a rate rising environment,\" said Mark Arnold, chief executive of Kensington Mortgages. That view is backed by government which has said it wants to see more certainty for borrowers. Without the need to include a buffer for potentially higher rates in the future, borrowers on a 40-year fixed deal may be able to borrow more. There are options which would allow people to continue on the same deal, without an extra charge, if they moved home, and allowances if borrowers became critically ill or sold up. However, brokers point out that there are still plenty of considerations that create risks for borrowers. Aaron Strutt, from Trinity Financial, said that borrowers would be paying higher interest on these longer-term deals, potentially for many years. Changing circumstances in people's lives could also have a big effect. If a customer needed to borrow more in the future - for example, for home improvements - then that could prove costly. David Hollingworth, of London and Country Mortgages, echoed that view, pointing out that borrowers would be tied in to a rate, but would also be tied in to certain conditions. \"They still face a dilemma - it is quite a balance to consider what is most important to them,\" he said. First-time buyers might also find that paying off their mortgage debt over time, and seeing the home rise in value, could easily make cheaper deals available to them in the future, which they would miss out on by fixing a rate for a long time. There should also be a consideration of how to pay for a long-term mortgage in later life. Becky O'Connor, head of pensions and savings at Interactive Investor, said: \"The rise of mortgages with ultra-long terms that stretch way past retirement age is worrying. It requires a fundamental rethink of what people will need in retirement and could require a change to the assumptions that underpin current guidance for pension savers on how much they should aim to have in their pot. \"If you are considering paying a mortgage into retirement, there's a huge reality check coming: you will need a much bigger pension than most people are currently on track for to finance this additional borrowing.\" ",

Industry body Oil and Gas UK (OGUK) said the estimated 1.2m tonnes would range from enormous platforms to equipment from the seabed. Operators could spend £16.6bn on the programme, according to the Decommissioning Insight 2021 report. It is hoped it could support thousands of jobs. OGUK predicted work in this area would be \"returning to its usual pace\" after a decline last year. In 2020 there were 84 wells decommissioned on the UK continental shelf (UKCS). North Sea decommissioning to top £15bn by 2030\nUK 'has largest decommissioning market'\nQ&A: North Sea decommissioning From 2022 to 2024 it is forecast that almost 600 wells and about 45 platform topsides and structures will be decommissioned. About 95% of the material that is decommissioned from old oil and gas platforms and other structures is typically recycled, OGUK said. However it added the focus was now switching to how items could be reused, so that parts - or sometimes even whole structures - could be used for new purposes. Joe Leask, OGUK's decommissioning manager, predicted \"an exciting 10 years\". He said: \"Decommissioning is more than a great challenge. It's also a huge opportunity for UK companies to show their engineering skills, powers of innovation and ability to compete on a global scale. \"Decommissioning is also a key part of the UK's transition to low-carbon energy and its aim of reaching net zero by 2050. This is partly because the installations being removed tend to be older and so generate more emissions relative to the oil and gas they produce. \"But it is also because of the growing opportunities for reuse, repurposing and recycling.\" The long-term outlook for fossil fuel demand remains uncertain. Earlier this month, a new global agreement to limit climate change - the Glasgow Climate Pact - was reached at the COP26 summit. ",

            "content": "Bulb Energy, which has 1.7 million customers, has announced that the firm will be put into administration. It is the largest UK energy company to face difficulties following a sharp rise in wholesale gas prices this year. Bulb will become the first energy company to be placed into \"special administration\", where it is run by the government through the regulator Ofgem. \"Customers of Bulb do not need to worry - Bulb will continue to operate as normal,\" Ofgem said. \"Customers will see no disruption to their supply and their account and tariff will continue as normal. Bulb staff will still be available to answer calls and queries.\" The special administration measure is only used if Ofgem is unable to find another company to take over an energy firm's customers. The regulator said it was planning to apply to a court to appoint an administrator who will run the company. Bulb said energy supplies were \"secure and all credit balances are protected\". Bulb is the UK's seventh biggest energy company and has 1,000 staff. It has been trying to shore up its finances for several weeks. Ofgem set up the Special Administrator Regime (SAR) for when an energy company goes bust but is too big to have its customers transferred to another firm. What can I do if my energy supplier goes bust? The aim of the regime is to stop financial failure spreading across the industry. Under the SAR scheme, the government can make grants and loans to the company while its future is sorted out. It could come in the shape of a takeover by another company, selling parts of its business or customers being transferred to another firm. Provision for special administration, owing to the collapse of a major player in the UK energy sector, has been part of the law for 10 years. It had never been needed until now. So, this decision will be a hugely significant moment in this gas crisis. But it is one to which customers of Bulb are being urged to respond by remaining calm and essentially doing nothing. It is written into the rules that a special administrator, unlike an ordinary administrator, has an obligation to consider consumers' interests as well as those of creditors who are owed money by Bulb. It means customers have short-term certainty that their supply, their current tariff, their credit balance and their bills will continue as normal. That means switching now would be a bad, and expensive, idea. Longer-term, some of that certainty diminishes as decisions are made about the future sale or wind-up of the company. Sarah Coles, a personal finance analyst at Hargreaves Lansdown, said that in effect it meant the \"taxpayer is likely to take the strain, so we might all end up paying a price\". A host of energy companies have gone bust over the last three months as wholesale gas prices have soared, affecting nearly four million customers. On Monday, Ofgem said British Gas would take on customers from Neon Reef and Social Energy Supply, which went bust last week. The two firms had a combined 35,000 customers. The UK's energy price cap - which limits what providers can charge - has exacerbated the problem, firms say. Justina Miltienyte, an energy policy expert at Uswitch, said the failure of Bulb signalled the \"tipping point\" of the UK energy crisis. \"Ultimately this demise wasn't caused by a badly run business model. Instead, Bulb was choked off by the way the government decided to structure the current energy market with the price cap.\" But Keith Anderson, chief executive of Scottish Power, said Bulb's fall into administration should \"focus minds on how the market operates\" and \"why so many companies have been allowed to operate so recklessly for so long\". \"The government has had to step in to protect customers from a failure of unprecedented size, and it will have to use taxpayers' money to do so,\" he added. John Arnold, a Bulb customer for several years from Potters Bar in Hertfordshire, told the BBC he was \"not surprised\" by the supplier's struggles given the current market, but added he was \"more than a little disappointed\" they had gone into administration. \"In my experience they have been a good company to deal with. I like their green credentials and their tariffs have been very fair,\" the 69-year-old said. Deborah Davenport, from Easton on the Hill in the East Midlands, said Bulb's customer service was \"absolutely brilliant\". While renovating her cottage which involved installing solar panels and a new gas supply, Ms Davenport said there were a few \"hiccups\" with meter readings and bills, but added Bulb solved the problems promptly. Bulb was \"just really pragmatic\" to deal with, she said, compared to some other energy firms who she believes \"do not care about people\". \"I just thought I had a voice with Bulb.\" London-based Bulb, which caters to 5-6% of the UK energy market, said the gas price crisis meant it was unable to raise the financing it needed from investors to keep on operating. \"The rising energy crisis... has concerned investors who can't go ahead while wholesale prices are so high and the price cap - designed to protect customers - currently means suppliers provide energy at a significant loss,\" Bulb said on its website. Bulb was founded in 2015 to compete with the Big Six energy firms and claimed to offer cheaper and greener electricity than its rivals. It grew quickly and launched divisions in France, Spain and the US, which will continue to trade. According to Bulb's latest available accounts, in the year to 31 March 2020 the company made losses of £63m. It also had a £55m loan facility due for repayment on 31 December this year. In September, Bulb appointed investment bank Lazard to look into restructuring options, which reportedly included a joint venture or merger with another firm, and a cash injection from existing shareholders. Customers will still continue to receive gas or electricity even if the energy supplier goes bust. Ofgem will move your account to a new supplier, but it may take a few weeks.

            "content": "Jerome Powell has been nominated for a second term as chair of the US Federal Reserve by President Joe Biden. Mr Powell is set to stay in the role, which includes managing inflation and regulating the financial system, for a further four years. He was initially appointed by former President Donald Trump and started his first term in 2018. The 68-year-old Republican has been praised for his management of the economy during the pandemic. The other front-running candidate, Lael Brainard, was favoured by progressives on the left of President Biden's Democratic Party. They have criticised Mr Powell for not doing enough to tackle climate change and poverty and say he has weakened regulation of financial institutions. Ms Brainard, who has been on the board of governors of the Federal Reserve since 2014, has been nominated as vice chair. Announcing the nominations, President Biden said: \"While there's still more to be done, we've made remarkable progress over the last 10 months in getting Americans back to work and getting our economy moving again. \"That success is a testament to the economic agenda I've pursued and to the decisive action that the Federal Reserve has taken under Chair Powell and Dr Brainard to help steer us through the worst downturn in modern American history and put us on the path to recovery.\" The nominations need to be confirmed in the Senate, before Mr Powell and Ms Brainard take up their posts in February 2022. After months of speculation and weeks of apparent hesitation, Joe Biden has decided to stick with Jerome Powell for what is, arguably, the most powerful economic job in the world. He does this despite clear indications that this will anger the left in his party. Some liberals in the closely-divided Senate have already promised to oppose Powell, who was first selected by Donald Trump, when his nomination comes to a vote in the chamber. Biden may think that by also picking the more left-leaning Lael Brainard to be vice-chair he would assuage some of this dissatisfaction, but that seems unlikely for liberals who want the Federal Reserve to be more aggressive in addressing income inequality and banking power. Instead, Biden has opted for stability in the Federal Reserve at a time when rising interest rates and continued Covid-related challenges put the US economy in a precarious position. The president may consider Powell the safe choice, with some Republicans already offering their support. But if Senate Democrats fracture over the nomination, it may make it more difficult for them to stick together to pass Biden's Build Back Better social spending legislation - a development could have grave political consequences for their party. Mr Biden said he was confident that Mr Powell and Ms Brainard would focus on tackling inflation, but also shared his belief that urgent action was needed to tackle climate change and risks to the financial system. President Biden's government is coming under increasing pressure as prices continue to rise for every day goods, eating into ordinary Americans' spending power. US prices rising at fastest rate for three decades\nUS Fed to trim pandemic stimulus from this month\nLeft-wing Democrats want Fed chief replaced Last month, consumer price inflation reached 6.2%, defying predictions, including from Mr Powell, that it would come quickly back under control once the economy reopened. The Federal Reserve has primary responsibility for managing inflation but the issue is also affecting the president's own poll ratings, according to a poll for CBS published this weekend. US Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen said having an independent and experienced Federal reserve was \"critically important to navigating this turbulent time\". US stocks opened higher after the news, which was broadly in line with what investors had expected. The appointment of Mr Powell, a former private equity lawyer and Republican, appointed by a Democratic president, represents a return to the traditional, non-partisan approach to selecting the Fed chair, after a more politicised approach from President Trump. It also ensures continuity of policy at a time of considerable debate over interest rate strategy. ",

Speaking at the CBI's annual conference, director general Tony Danker said that \"levelling up\" could not be left to the free market. He added \"high-valued\" sectors, firms and jobs were needed across the UK. Boris Johnson told the same conference levelling up was still his \"moral mission\" and an \"economic imperative\". The prime minister also defended the scaled-back plans for rail in the North, insisting the government's new schemes would still be \"transformatory\". Meanwhile, Labour leader Sir Keir Starmer outlined \"five fiscal rules\" at the CBI conference that the next Labour government intended to follow, saying the Conservatives had \"missed an opportunity to remake Britain\" with the autumn Budget. Mr Danker told the CBI conference that the headquarters of many businesses were currently \"too often based in London and the South East\", with the UK operating as a \"branch line economy\", showing that the free market had failed to create prosperity across the country. But he said the rise of new industries such as biotech provided the opportunity for a \"new industrial revolution\" across the UK and \"a shot at redemption\". \"For five decades we've had no idea how to [tackle the divide], but now we've got industries like clean and renewable energy, life sciences, cyber-security and they don't have to be based in the South East,\" Mr Danker told the BBC's Today programme earlier on Monday. UK growth slows as supply issues hit the recovery\nFairer, greener economy 'offers prizes for all' The CBI is concerned that old industries such as textiles in Lancashire, shipbuilding on the Clyde, and steel in Sheffield have been allowed to \"die\" since the 1980s. It also disagrees with the government's decision to scrap the Leeds leg of the HS2 high-speed rail line, which was originally billed as being key to levelling up. Last week, the government dropped plans to extend the HS2 line to Leeds and said the Northern Powerhouse Rail route from Liverpool to Leeds would run partly on existing lines rather than new ones. The CBI also thinks firms should be encouraged to cluster in towns, and should have more power in decisions over local infrastructure and in coming up with economic strategies. Mr Danker told the Today programme: \"I do think we need a much firmer, more ambitious growth strategy from the government. \"At the end of the day, if we [the UK] don't get growth up back to our pre-crisis, pre 2008 growth rates, what we're going to have is cuts to spending, rises in taxes, so growth has to be the North Star.\" Speaking at the same conference, the prime minister acknowledged there were \"chronic problems\" underlying the UK economy, including the imbalance between firms which were \"go-getting world-beaters\" and the \"long comet tail\" of firms which lacked the necessary skills and investment to boost productivity. But he said levelling-up was achievable and would help the UK become a bigger economy than Germany. \"If this country could achieve the same kind of geographical balance and dispersion of growth and wealth that you find in most of our most successful economic comparators, and if all our businesses could reach more balance in their levels of productivity, then there would be absolutely no stopping us. \"We would achieve - what I believe we can - and become the biggest and most successful economy in Europe.\" Labour's Sir Keir told the CBI conference that the next Labour government would make a \"contract\" with business where it made fiscal discipline and investment into skills a priority. \"What we need now is a sector-by-sector plan, for the car industry, for the steel industry, for all industry - our competitors are already doing it, we can't afford not to,\" he said. \"This is our side of the contract - to run a stable government and a tight ship, to equip the next generation for work, to invest in British business and to create a wave of high-skilled jobs.\" ",

            "content": "Holidaymakers are being urged to use £132m worth of unspent vouchers issued during the pandemic before they lose financial protection. The credit notes were offered by travel firms as alternatives to cash refunds when holidays had to be cancelled. The vouchers, backed by the Atol insurance scheme, can be used towards new holidays or exchanged for cash. But the regulator said the refund protection against firms going bust will end on 30 September 2022. The Civil Aviation Authority (CAA) also said travel firms would not longer be able to issue the Atol-protected cover after 20 December. The refund credit notes (RCNs) were issued from March last year, the month of the first UK coronavirus lockdown. Michael Budge, head of Atol, which is run by the CAA, said: \"With over £130m of Atol refund credit notes yet to be redeemed, and international travel opening up again, we want to remind consumers to redeem any unused credits to make sure they do not lose out.\" He said RCNs were a fantastic tool to reassure consumers and support the industry. Many travel firms faced ruin if they were forced to hand back huge refunds in cash after large swathes of the industry closed down. But travellers were outraged at being offered credit notes instead of cash refunds, fearing that if firms went bust they would lose money. In July 2020, the CAA decided to cover credit notes under the Atol scheme, and £131.7m of them remain unspent. \"The decision to end the scheme reflects the changing of international travel restrictions with significantly increased demand from consumers over recent months due to the opening up of more destinations.\" Mr Budge said. Under the Atol scheme, if a firm goes out of business holiday costs will be refunded. If it happens when travellers are abroad they will be able to finish their holidays and fly home. All tour operators selling package holidays by air must hold an Atol licence. ",

A Bain Capital takeover would mean LV= losing its mutual status, with members given £100 each as part of the deal. LV= has issued more details about the offer ahead of a vote by members, saying it saves the firm's future as \"business as usual does not work\". The Bain deal faces a backlash from politicians and its member-customers. Politicians from several parties have raised concerns about the prospect of LV= being bought by a US private equity firm. Some LV= members are also unhappy over the size of the possible payouts if the deal goes through. LV=, founded in 1843 and formerly known as Liverpool Victoria, has also rebuffed an approach from a rival, Royal London. Row over sale of insurer LV= escalates\nBoss of insurer LV= defends sale amid backlash On Monday, LV= set out a more detailed analysis of why it believed the Bain deal was best, saying to remain a standalone business would require significant investment from its members. \"We all came to the firm conclusion it would not be fair for us to ask our with-profit members to finance a future that requires significant investment, which many would not benefit from,\" said David Barral, senior independent director of LV=. \"It was a decision we didn't take lightly given our mutual heritage, but we know it is the right choice because it saves the future of LV=.\" The analysis of LV='s position concluded that: LV= was a sub-scale, life and pensions business with a loss-making new business unit.\nThe group had a \"challenged\" capital structure and operated in an increasingly competitive market dominated by well-capitalised, global insurers\nLV= needed more than £100m of investment in IT modernisation, business operational improvements, product developments and customer service\nAny new investment would have to be funded from within LV=, which could hit returns to with-profit members. The report said a Bain deal brought the needed financial stability, and would mean a further £212m of capital being available for distribution to members, increasing the total to £616m. LV= said: \"The board received several proposals and after due diligence and negotiation, concluded unanimously... that Bain Capital offered the best outcome for LV= members, employees and other stakeholders compared to all other proposals received and all strategic options considered.\" Bosses at LV have previously said it was \"grossly misleading\" for Royal London to describe its proposal as a \"mutual alternative\", stressing that any such deal would still lead to demutualisation. Royal London has insisted that LV remaining a mutual \"is an option\" under its approach. \"We do not want to break up LV and would be delighted if the LV board would engage in discussions,\" it added.

            "content": "New homes and buildings in England will be required by law to install electric vehicle charging points from next year, the prime minister has announced. The government said the move will see up to 145,000 charging points installed across the country each year. New-build supermarkets, workplaces and buildings undergoing major renovations will also come under the new law. The move comes as the UK aims to switch to electric cars, with new petrol and diesel cars sales banned from 2030. Announcing the new laws at the Confederation of British Industry's conference on Monday, Prime Minister Boris Johnson said the UK was going to \"radically\" change its cars, trucks, buses and other modes of transport. \"The force driving that change won't be government, it won't even be business...it will be the consumer. It will be the young people of today, who can see the consequences of climate change and will be demanding better from us.\" But Labour said the announcement does not address the \"appalling\" geographical divide in available charging points. \"London and the South East have more public car charging points than the rest of England and Wales combined. Yet there is nothing here to help address this. \"Nor is there help so lower and middle income families can afford electric vehicles or the investment required to build the gigafactories we need,\" Labour said. The government said the new laws will \"make it as easy as refuelling a petrol or diesel car today\". It said \"simpler ways to pay\" to charge vehicles through contactless payments would also be introduced at \"all new fast and rapid charge points\". Britain currently has about 25,000 charging points, but the Competition and Markets Authority has said it could need 10 times as many before 2030. The switch to electric vehicles is part of the UK's strategy to hit climate targets, with cars and taxis accounting for 16% of UK emissions in 2019. Several major car manufacturers, such as Jaguar and Volvo plan to go all electric from 2025 and 2030 and Ford has said all vehicles sold in Europe will be electric by 2030. However, four of the world's biggest carmakers, Volkswagen, Toyota, Renault-Nissan and Hyundai-Kia failed to sign a COP 26 summit pledge to only sell zero emissions cars and vans by 2035. UK electric car sales are growing, with about 10% of cars sold in 2020 being electric, up from 2.5% in 2018. However, concerns have been raised about the lack of charging infrastructure. The Policy Exchange think tank has warned the rollout of charging points has fallen behind and said there is a risk of \"charging blackspots\" in small towns and rural areas unless it speeds up. MPs on the Transport Select Committee have also said people must be protected from excessive pricing for public electric car charging, with home charging being much cheaper. Mike Childs, Friends of the Earth's head of policy, welcomed the government's announcement, adding that electric vehicles had a \"significant role to play in building a zero-carbon future\". \"New housing should also include secure cycle storage and access to high quality public transport, to provide real alternatives to driving and help cut congestion,\" Mr Childs added. Along with its announcement on charging points, the government also confirmed almost £10m will fund a new hydrogen project at the UK's largest onshore windfarm near Glasgow. The cash injection will help the Whitelee green hydrogen project develop the UK's largest electrolyser, a system which converts water into hydrogen gas as a way to store energy and supply local transport providers with zero-carbon fuel.

            "header": "Indian billionaires bet big on homegrown couture",
            "content": "India's largest conglomerates have been snapping up stakes in high-end, homegrown designer brands to help them scale up and go global. The trend, experts say, points to a luxury retail market on the cusp of maturity. In October, Reliance Brands Limited (RBL), a subsidiary of the the oil-to-telecoms Reliance conglomerate, announced it was buying 40% equity in celebrity fashion designer Manish Malhotra's eponymous label. A week later, the company bought more than 50% stake in Ritu Kumar, one of India's oldest fashion houses. Malhotra, who has been dressing Bollywood's biggest stars for the last 30 years, launched his label about 15 years ago. He has annual revenues in the ballpark of $30m (£22m), according to Forbes. The secretive Chinese brand dressing Gen Z The call to partner with a corporate house like Reliance was driven partly by his decision to focus on his upcoming Bollywood directorial debut, Malhotra said. But it was also the result of his ambition to expand internationally. \"I have the practical knowledge, but for someone who has not studied the business of fashion, my dreams and stories need that backing to go global,\" he told the BBC at his design workshop in Mumbai city's Santacruz suburb. \"The label needs to get more organised. It's very family-led.\" It's a logical move, and in line with international trends, says Ankur Bisen, senior partner at Technopak retail consultancy. He points to several fashion powerhouses - Dior, Chanel, Hugo Boss, Saint Laurent (YSL) - who did the same: they \"institutionalised\" by moving beyond the founder who started the eponymous labels. \"Many of the designers in India are now in their 50s, and 60s and having to take that call,\" Mr Bisen said. Reliance is keen to set up more flagship stores by Malhotra, and also hasten the company's foray into e-commerce. RBL's current portfolio of brand partnerships includes marquee global brands such as Armani Exchange, Bottega Veneta, Jimmy Choo, Kate Spade New York, Michael Kors, Tiffany & Co. among others. But RBL isn't the first or only company to invest in homegrown labels. Aditya Birla Fashion, owned by the India-based multinational Aditya Birla Group, has done the same - in recent years it has acquired stake in major couturiers like Sabyasachi, Tarun Tahiliani and Shantanu & Nikhil. The shift towards domestic designer brands was long overdue, experts say. Can sustainable fashion turn the red carpet green? \"International brands are not going to appeal to an Indian audience. They've tried,\" said Nonita Kalra, editor in chief of Tata CliQ Luxury. \"Apparel in India remains very specifically Indian in its taste. If you want to grow in the fashion market, you'll have to grow keeping very specific Indian tastes in mind,\" She added that since couture shopping in India is largely driven by weddings and religious festivals, the allure of homegrown labels lies in their emphasis on bridal and ethnic fashion. And by partnering with corporate companies, she said, designers can \"fine-tune and layer\" their products so they can reach a larger market through more affordable luxury wear. In fact, earlier this year, Sabyasachi became the first Indian designer to launch a collection in partnership with Swedish fashion giant H&M. And Rahul Mishra, a rising haute couture designer, collaborated with a popular Indian affordable label - W - to launch a collection ahead of the festival season this year. According to data from McKinsey, India's apparel market will be worth $60bn in 2022, making it the sixth-largest in the world, comparable to the UK and Germany. Couture labels occupy a small sliver of it currently, and are still modest in size, compared to their global counterparts. The annual turnover in India's top 10 couture houses ranges between $25-$100m, according to the Economic Times. But the interest in them is \"not because of who they are today, but what they can be tomorrow,\" Ms Bisen said. \"Also the alternative for retailers - label development, building design talent and creating brand recall - is too expensive and time-consuming.\" That is, it's easier to invest in a label that already has all of that. But making a global play with ethnic couture might be easier dreamt than achieved. Both demand and supply are a challenge. In a world where fashion trends are set largely in Europe and America, and the market is patronised by consumers from China and the Middle East, making Indian ethnic wear aspirational is a tough proposition. It's also difficult to introduce a supply chain that suits the global industrial model to Indian fashion, which still relies on weavers, handiwork and a vast informal talent pool. While the pandemic was a temporary setback, industry watchers say the revival has been quick, aided by e-commerce. This has also made it easier for local designers to tap into India's wealthy and 18 million-strong diaspora. \"Increasingly nomadic customers who are cosmopolitan in their outlook have reshaped our approach of looking at customers in a geography-agnostic way,\" said Darshan Mehta, president and chief executive of RBL. As the world opens up after the pandemic, Indian designers are also keen to expand overseas. Access to capital was a huge handicap for these labels, but that is no longer a hurdle. After the investment from Aditya Birla Fashion, Sabyasachi has announced that he will open a sprawling 60,000 sqft (5,574 sqm) store in New York in 2022. And in February this year, he showcased a selection of clothes and accessories in the city's luxury department store, Bergdorf Goodman. Given the flurry of announcements, experts believe the sector is riding a wave of optimism. \"Luxury needs help,\" Ms Kalra said. \"I think we are going to see a very accelerated rate of acquisition, change and growth. It won't always be easy, and there will be dramatic break ups, and pleasant falls outs and conscious uncouplings.\" \"But I think things as we know it are going to change forever.\" ",

            "content": "The COP26 summit was a successful showcase for Glasgow, and for the social and business benefits of getting back together, post-Covid.\nIt highlighted the business travel industry as conference traffic gets back to growth, following an unprecedented Covid shock. It is having to adapt.\nPatterns of working will have changed forever, including the merger of work with leisure time as people book desirable locations to meet and then stay on for remote work mixed with travel. The Glasgow Climate Pact may not have lived up to expectations for reduced carbon emissions and limiting global warming: but the COP26 gathering that led to the agreement certainly did. The past week has been a hectic one for the former United Nations territory on the north bank of the Clyde, as it was returned to the control of the UK Cabinet Office and much of the township dismantled. That work is far from finished, but the vast suspended spinning globe was removed from the Hydro in time for Fat Boy Slim, and the conference centre should be fully brushed and flossed in time for a conference of dental hygienists by the end of this month. Kathleen Warden, who leads the conference division of the Scottish Event Campus, was getting messages throughout the fortnight from other conference venues and from clients to say how good Glasgow was looking. The Armadillo, the Hydro, the Squinty Bridge, Finnieston Titan crane and the River Clyde itself provided the iconography. Even though some US news networks and the UK prime minister himself seemed to think that Glasgow and Edinburgh were one and the same, there wasn't a media market around the globe that wasn't aware that this was the crossroads for what Warden calls the world's most important gathering this year. It was one that made her team immensely proud. Almost every nation was represented. Heads of government came to Glasgow from most of them. There were 37,000 accredited delegates. And although Covid and security conspired to bring notoriously long queues, there were no significant security breaches, and street protests met with firm but mostly amiable policing. The evidence so far suggests much lower level of Covid transmission than in the general population, and the weather was unseasonably settled and sunny, with the exception of the drookit Saturday for the big march. So if that can be seen as a success, what next for the Glasgow host city and for Scottish tourism? Glasgow's name will reverberate into the future\nWhat was agreed at COP26? VisitScotland, with other Scottish government agencies, tapped into the environmental zeitgeist with promotional videos issued during COP26 that highlighted Scotland's outdoors and green awareness. One was titled \"treading lightly\". This did not seem the appropriate moment to encourage visiting dignitaries, delegates and media to sample Scotland's golf courses or to burn fossil fuels round the North Coast 500. However, the message that \"Scotland is Open\" - the slogan and top line takeaway from Scottish government marketing - will not have been lost on both visitors and distant observers. The same theme is being aimed at visitors, travellers, potential migrant workers and students, and at investors. At the Scottish Event Campus, with its exhibition, conference and concert facilities, bookings are picking up, after 20 dismal months of cancellations, uncertainty and temporary conversion into the Louisa Jordan NHS hospital. Kathleen Warden explained to me that, in normal times, 80% of its conference activity is \"associations\" - from philatelists to those dental hygienists. They have to get back to meeting, she argues. Not doing so is not an option. And for all the Zoom and Teams meetings, with which people have both kept in touch and found an alternative to business travel for meetings, nothing beats the chemistry, social interaction and serendipity of medics, scientists and technologists meeting and sharing and getting to understand one another. Professor John Lennon, an expert in travel and tourism at Glasgow Caledonian University, acknowledged that work had changed, and cities with it. More people are working from home and will continue to do so, he said, but that means employers have to focus all the more on bringing them together on occasion - to inform, inspire, evoke and manage them. Team-building may therefore become a more important part of that, taking participants out of conventional conference activities and into more practical, social and enjoyable activities. Think of it as a large, quite expensive, office water cooler. It's reasonable to assume that we have learned to value social interaction more, having spent so many months being denied it. And that value can translate into earnings. Lennon says Scotland has not done all that well at converting the potential for drawing people out of such conferences and events and sending them out around Scotland to sample the leisure options. That may be changing, he notes: AirBnB booking figures are growing most strongly in the category of 28-days-plus. That suggests people are travelling to a city for work, and opting to stay there for leisure and for continuing remote work from a different, temporary home - making the most of the change of view and travelling more slowly, with less impact on the planet. Kathleen Warden told me that the industry reckons on getting back to pre-pandemic levels of activity between next year and 2024. A worse case scenario - in a study of the sector commissioned by Cities Restart, a grouping that want to see city centres kick-started back to life - would hit London particularly hard. International travel is recovering more slowly than domestic, and leisure more quickly than business. The metropolis had around 40% of the UK's international business events spend. And if Covid and uncertainty continue into a worst case scenario, then it would take nine years, to 2028, before a recovery returns London to pre-pandemic levels. The Tourism Economics study, however, has a rosier scenario in which the business events market picks up pace to reach 43% more value by 2026 - more than £17bn. It says international visitors for such events are worth six times more than domestic ones, at nearly £1,100 per head, and that gap has been growing. For the global picture, another study for the World Travel and Tourism Council (WTTC), working with McKinsey consultancy, the estimate is of growth by quarter this year, reaching two-thirds of its previous level during 2022. But the report, published earlier this month and snappily titled \"Adapting to Endemic Covid-19: The Outlook for Business Travel\", brings a reminder of just how precipitous the decline has been. It concludes that the travel and tourism sector as a whole suffered losses of US$4.5 trillion, with 62 million jobs lost worldwide. Domestic visitor spend was down 45% in 2020 and international by 69%. Although business travel represented only 21% of global travel in 2019, it has been much more important to some city destinations and to some travel companies. Planespotter excitement over COP26 aircraft Pre-pandemic, the WTTC report says that business travel brought around 70% of revenue for the world's high-end hotel chains. And although business travellers only represent around 12% of air passengers, their premium seats and flexible ticketing brought in between 55 and 75% of airline profits. Even with recovery, it seems unlikely that such patterns of spending will recover unchanged. The challenge for the industry is to invest in facilities - including the technology for hybrid conferences of attendees and remote contributions - and to be nimble in adaptation to new ways of working and meeting. There will be business opportunities as well as challenges. As Scotland's airports saw at the start of COP26 when heads of government arrived, one business travel sector that has done well out of Covid, and the reduction in scheduled flying, happens also to be among the worst for the environment: the market for private jets.

Charisma Meehan, 17, Decrae Simms, 17, Alex Yang, 16, and Ethan Widgery-Powell, 15, set up their brand Brum Ting, inspired by their home city. The youngsters began by working in the club's Nechells workshop to create products alongside school work. They received support and tuition from mentors at the free@last youth centre and now have global ambitions. \"I believe that with the correct input and effort that Brum Ting can become a worldwide brand name,\" Ethan said. \"More people will know our story and become inspired to thrive in their work, everyday lives and their passion for whatever it is they enjoy.\" The friends were inspired by one of their youth club projects, which involved making jewellery and selling it at a market in Sutton Coldfield. Free@last founder John Street said they were \"bitten by the business bug\" and spotted a gap in the market for Birmingham-themed souvenirs and merchandise. \"Every step of the journey has been a challenge - from learning to Zoom and attend meetings through lockdown, to having enough money to buy products to sell, to finding the right suppliers who will help them on their journey,\" Mr Street said. \"The biggest challenge now is finding the time to manage school, life, mental wellbeing and business.\" The teenagers have already sold hundreds of pounds worth of clothing and accessories. For their next step, they hope to franchise \"Ting\" so other towns and cities can have similar projects and inspire other young people to get into business. \"As long as we stay determined and put the work in, I'm more than sure Brum Ting will be successful,\" Decrae said.

            "content": "An entrepreneur accused of scamming investors for millions of dollars with a bogus blood test has surprised a US court by testifying in her defence. Elizabeth Holmes is accused of making false claims about her firm Theranos, including that its technology could detect diseases with a drop of blood. Ms Holmes, 37, faces multiple charges of fraud and could spend years in jail if found guilty. She denies wrongdoing. At its peak her firm was valued at $9bn (£6.5bn). Taking the stand Ms Holmes said her work at Theranos had made her believe in the company's technology. She explained about how she founded the firm after dropping out of Stanford University, and how her team made an apparent technological breakthrough. \"We worked for years with teams of scientists and engineers to miniaturise all of the technologies in the laboratory,\" she told jurors. Who is Elizabeth Holmes and why is she on trial? Throughout the two-month trial, jurors in California have heard testimony from more than two dozen prosecution witnesses. They include patients and investors who prosecutors say Ms Holmes deceived. Ms Holmes rose to fame in 2013 thanks to technology she claimed could test for multiple diseases using just a few drops of blood from a finger prick. She attracted high-profile investors including Rupert Murdoch but in 2015 a whistleblower revealed the tests did not work, and the billionaire fell from grace. By 2018 Theranos had collapsed amid one of the biggest corporate scandals in recent US history. Ms Holmes has pleaded not guilty to nine counts of wire fraud and two counts of conspiracy. Her lawyers say she did not intend to defraud, but instead \"naively underestimated\" the challenges her business faced. The trial, which began in September, is expected to run until next month. It's been described as Silicon Valley's trial of the decade. Books, podcasts, even a Hollywood film has been commissioned about what happened at the company. Yet up until now it wasn't clear whether Ms Holmes would give evidence - defendants are not obliged to testify in US criminal cases. Removing her mask the jury was able to see the defendant for the first time. She smiled and spoke with confidence about the company's origins and why she wanted to help people. It's a seriously risky move for the defence, as it now opens Ms Holmes up to cross-examination. The move could be viewed as a sign of weakness, allowing the prosecution at the subject in a fraud case could backfire. But Holmes clearly believes that she can convince jurors that her intentions were honourable, and that she was unaware of Theranos' major problems. She has an awful lot on the line. If found guilty she could face up 20 years in prison. ",

            "header": "Early Christmas shopping lifts retail sales in October",
            "content": "Early Christmas shopping helped to push up shop sales in October as people spent more on clothing and on toys. Sales rose by 0.8% in October, following no growth in September, according to the Office for National Statistics (ONS). Clothing sales reached their highest level since the start of the pandemic, said the ONS. It also said second-hand stores, like charity shops and auction houses, had seen sales rise. Sales in clothing stores were only 0.5% below pre-pandemic levels, \"with some retailers suggesting that early Christmas trading had boosted sales,\" the ONS said. Items that people were buying or pre-ordering earlier than usual for Christmas this year included toys and clothes, shoes and accessories. \"After five months of no growth, retail sales picked up in October,\" said ONS chief economist Grant Fitzner. \"Although sales overall are above pre-pandemic levels, it remains a mixed picture.\" Fuel sales fell sharply, returning to more normal levels after the fuel supply crisis in September, and food and online sales also dropped. Why is the cost of living going up?\nFive items that are going up in price and why Helen Dickinson, chief executive of the British Retail Consortium, said that retailers were putting in \"a gargantuan effort\" to make sure they had Christmas stock amid continuing supply chain problems. \"Labour shortages throughout the supply chains - from farms to distribution - are pushing up costs and creating some gaps on the shelves,\" she said. \"Nonetheless, retailers are prioritising Christmas essentials, and many have laid out their festive offerings a little earlier to ensure everyone has time to buy treats and decorations before the big day.\" She said that retailers were hoping demand would be sustained throughout the Christmas period. \"However, challenges remain, with higher prices looming and many households facing rising energy bills.\" The jump in sales in non-food stores, which includes second-hand shops, helped to boost October's figures. Robin Osterley, chief executive of the Charity Retail Association, said like-for-like sales across the charity shop sector in October were between 3% and 5% higher than before the Covid pandemic - a \"very significant\" rise. People's attitudes had been changing towards donating and buying second-hand clothing in particular, he said, in part due to growing environmental awareness. \"To chuck it in the bin is not doing anything apart from filling up landfill,\" he said. \"[And] people want to buy from a good cause.\" There is a growing \"backlash to fast fashion\", he added, saying that people wanted to buy good quality second-hand clothing \"that will last\". \"We are in a zeitgeist of people wanting to buy second-hand. We see that lasting for a very long time, if not forever,\" he said. There are also sobering reasons why second-hand sales are booming, Mr Osterley said. Many people are finding their household budgets are being squeezed by redundancy or price rises, he said. \"People are coming to charity shops for economic reasons,\" he said. \"They are looking to buy in the most cost effective way. I think inflation is a factor.\" The cost of living rose again in October with annual inflation running at 4.2%, its highest rate in almost 10 years. Between August and September there was a fall in sales volumes in second-hand goods stores such as charity shops, auction houses and antique shops, but sales of expensive items at auction can make this data volatile, the ONS said. Separate figures from the ONS showed that government borrowing dipped last month as the economy continued to recover and the furlough scheme wound up. Borrowing - the difference between its spending and tax income - stood at £18.8bn in October, £200m less than a year earlier. Despite the fall, the figure still marked the second-highest total for October since monthly records began in 1993. The interest the government pays on what it borrows also jumped because of rising inflation. The ONS said interest payments tripled in October from a year earlier to £5.6bn. The government has spent record amounts on emergency measures during the pandemic, such as the furlough scheme, which was designed to protect wages. That was withdrawn completely on 1 October. Chancellor Rishi Sunak said government support in the pandemic \"protected millions of jobs and businesses, but also left us with much higher public debt\". He added that Budget measures \"will keep debt on a sustainable path in the years to come\". ",

            "header": "Firm offers staff unlimited leave to stop burnout",
            "content": "Workers at a London stockbrokers will have unlimited holiday from next year to try to prevent staff burnout. Finncapp employees will have to take a minimum of four weeks leave plus two or three days every quarter. Unlimited paid holiday is a perk popular among some US tech firms but less so among financial services companies. For some companies it works well, increasing productivity, but others found staff took less time off. Finncapp, which also gives financial advice, has been \"exceptionally busy\" as City mergers and capital markets boom, chief executive Sam Smith told the BBC. Ms Smith said the company really started to notice how much mental health strain employees were under in February this year. On Zoom calls, people were getting frustrated and some were not wanting to communicate. \"People were fed up and had no resilience left because of having been in the pandemic for a long time,\" she said. Staff had worked very long hours from home in the pandemic, especially during lockdowns, and the \"lines between work and life became blurred\", Ms Smith said. \"There were no boundaries, no respite, it was just constant,\" she said, not only in her company but in others. And because everyone else was working, that put more pressure on people to just keep working, she said. By June, mental health pressures were starting to hit employees' physical health, with people taking time off, and the company decided to change its working practices. From 1 January, staff will have to take minimum leave, and that does not include time off to care for sick parents, children or pets, or time off for parents evenings or to deal with household problems such as a broken boiler. \"All these things are not holiday,\" Ms Smith said. The company decided to set out minimum amounts of leave that must be taken - which was first reported by Bloomberg - as the fear was that just having a blanket policy of offering unlimited leave could backfire. That is what happened at software firm CharlieHR, where an unlimited leave policy led to staff not taking enough holiday. \"The reality is that it's not actually unlimited,\" chief operating officer Ben Gately previously told the BBC. Other firms have been trying to deal with workplace stress by giving workers some time off. Dating app Bumble temporarily closed its offices in June for a week to combat workplace stress. It brought in a policy where twice a year there is a week-long company-wide holiday. Employees have unlimited paid leave and UK workers must take 24 days holiday. \"Our teams were expressing Zoom fatigue, as well as actual burnout,\" said Tariq Shaukat, president of Bumble. \"The stress comes from always being connected but when working from home, or vacationing, there's always a feeling of 'what am I missing'?\" In April, LinkedIn shut down for a week, giving nearly all of its 16,000 employees a break. Nike headquarters staff in Oregon also got a week off in August to support their mental health. ",

            "header": "The boom in buying a car without ever leaving your sofa",
            "content": "\"This will become the norm - simply because it is so much easier, and quicker, than visiting a showroom or seller. You can buy a car from the comfort of your own home, at any time of the day, and tailor the delivery to suit you.\" NHS junior doctor, May Lang, 30, is one of a growing number of people happy to buy their cars entirely online. Most Britons have a budget of £15,000 or less to purchase a car, according to YouGov, and up until now making this kind of large purchase has been slow to move online - perhaps unsurprising given the sums involved and complexity of the transaction. But Covid has dramatically changed how we do our shopping, altering not only the type of products we are willing to buy online, but also how we make some of our most expensive purchases. The pandemic coincided with the rise of a new breed of car dealers like Cazoo and Cinch, which let shoppers buy, part-exchange and finance used vehicles entirely online. Until relatively recently, buying a car involved hours scouring adverts, travelling to showrooms, test-driving different makes and models, and enduring \"the hard sell\" pitches at the dealership. Those days may be numbered. Many prospective buyers now conduct their research entirely online and decide what they want before even heading to a forecourt. Nathan Coe, the boss of car advertising giant AutoTrader, says the rise of so-called online disrupters in the sector has started a ripple effect - with traditional dealerships also shifting more of their car-buying process online. \"What they have done is catalyse the rest of the industry to think 'hang on, we have got to do more of this online',\" he says. Even if you've never heard of these new names, you've probably been bombarded by their advertising. Cazoo sponsors a host of sporting competitions and teams, including the English Football League, Aston Villa and Everton, while Cinch prominently features celebrity Rylan Clark in its primetime TV adverts. The firms currently only make up a fraction - about 2% - of what is a very large and lucrative UK used-car market, but many believe they are here to stay and will only grow. They have been helped by a surge in demand and prices for used cars - driven primarily by a shortage of materials like microchips that has curbed production of new vehicles. \"Other markets that started a lot earlier in their shift to online are [now] 60-70% online, whereas cars are lagging significantly,\" say Cazoo founder and chief executive Alex Chesterman, pointing to the travel industry or property market. Online platforms simplify the experience by offering greater choice and transparency on price, he argues. \"If you think about the traditional experience - going to a used car dealer - it has limited selection [and] is not particularly convenient. You have to travel a certain distance to view a product that you may, or may not buy. You also don't get transparency traditionally on pricing - you have to haggle in order to get the best price.\" The entrepreneur, whose glittering track-record includes creating online film distributer LoveFilm and property website Zoopla, says his inspiration for Cazoo came from a booming business in the US car market, called Carvana. The huge size of the used-car market was also a big draw - with plenty of space for new competitors and ideas. \"It's an almost £100bn market in the UK and a £500bn market across Europe.\" In creating Cazoo, his team has \"always tried to focus on consumer experience\", Mr Chesterman says. \"There were plenty who said 'nobody will ever buy a car online, they have to go and see it'. Well, three years later I can tell you with absolute certainty that is not true at all.\" According to data from AutoTrader, 72% of customers are interested in conducting more of their car-buying process online. Chief executive Nathan Coe says AutoTrader's website traffic increased year-on-year and that during the pandemic, the industry discovered \"ways of doing things digitally\" which didn't involve the forecourt in sales. Could shopping online for a car become as routine as ordering the supermarket shop or purchasing from Amazon? Ms Lang, who first bought a Toyota Aygo, and then an electric Nissan Leaf through Cazoo won't go back to the old approach. \"I found the process to be incredibly easy. I simply chose the car I wanted...paid for it, and selected my preferred date and time of delivery.\" So, where does this leave the car salesperson? \"I'm definitely not saying there won't be any salespeople anymore,\" says Mr Coe. \"I think the job will change quite dramatically, and the nature of that person, how they are paid, what they are rewarded for, what they are trying to deliver, will differ.\" Cazoo's strategy so far is paying off, with revenues up by 267% in the 12 months to 30 September. It was valued at £5bn when it listed on the New York Stock Exchange in August. Cinch forecasts selling 70,000 used cars in 2021, after launching in July last year. But buying online doesn't work for everyone - about 1.5 million homes in the UK still have no internet access, Ofcom says, and many of this group will be older shoppers. There will also be buyers who will want to see the car first. Alex Chesterman says online and offline dealers can happily co-exist: \"We are at less than 2% digital today and maybe we get 20% digital in five years - that still means 80% of the world carries on doing what they are currently doing.\" However Emma Hull, a 26-year-old who works for Liberty Marketing in Cardiff, says she would not buy online again after a negative experience buying her Audi A1 from a dealership based in Birmingham. After parting with thousands she then paid £150 for her new car to be delivered. But on arrival she found it was damaged, with more scratches than advertised and a stain on one seat. It was also \"really dirty\", she says. Philip Nothard, insight and strategy director at Cox Automotive, says there has been disruption on the market \"where it's all about online, it's all about efficiency\", but believes there is still a need for showrooms and demand from consumers to physically see cars. Peter Smyth, director of Swansway Car Dealers, believes the industry will evolve in to a hybrid system that offers full sales online and in forecourts. \"Most people we find even when they buy online, leave a holding deposit, but in the end they always want to come and inspect the vehicle,\" he says.

            "content": "Alibaba shares have slumped by more than 10% in Hong Kong trade after the Chinese online retail giant warned of a slowdown in consumer spending. The company forecast that its annual revenue would grow at the slowest pace since its stock market debut in 2014. The weak figures underscore the firm's struggles with increasing competition and Beijing's regulatory crackdown. On Thursday, Alibaba's US-listed shares ended the New York trading session more than 11% lower. In the three months to the end of September, Alibaba's revenue rose by 29% to 200.7bn yuan ($31.4bn, £23.3bn), its slowest rate of growth for a year and a half. The company also said it expects its annual revenue to grow by between 20% and 23%, which is lower than analysts' forecasts. Alibaba chief executive Daniel Zhang told investors that increasing competition and slowing consumption in China were the main causes of the weaker growth. Chinese shoppers have become more cautious about spending as new coronavirus outbreaks, power cuts and concerns about the property market weigh on sentiment. The latest figures do not include sales from this month's Singles Day, or \"11.11 Global Shopping Festival\". This year Alibaba's usually glitzy event was a more toned down affair than previously as Beijing cracks down on businesses and China's economic growth slows. Sales for the 11-day event rose at their slowest rate since it was launched in 2009, up 8.5% on last year. However, customer spending still hit a fresh record high of 540.3bn yuan. Alibaba has come under intense scrutiny from Beijing as tough new rules have been imposed on the country's big technology companies. Earlier this year, it paid a record $2.8bn fine after a probe found it had abused its dominant market position for years. Alibaba also said it would change the way it conducted its business. The company's shares have lost more than a third of their value so far this year. ",

            "content": "A group of US states is investigating how Instagram targets children, despite it posing potential risks to them. The group - made up of both Democrat and Republican states - is investigating Instagram and Facebook's parent company Meta to determine if consumer protection laws were broken. It comes after a company whistleblower testified in the US that the company knew its products can harm children. A Meta spokesman on Thursday denied that their platforms are unhealthy. Massachusetts Attorney General Maura Healey, a Democrat who first announced the inquiry, tweeted: \"Facebook, or Meta, has known Instagram is linked to depression, eating disorders & suicide among young people.\" \"We will identify if any laws were broken and end the abuse for good.\" Nebraska Attorney General Doug Peterson, a Republican, said that the companies \"treat our children as mere commodities to manipulate for longer screen time engagement and data extraction\". \"These social media platforms are extremely dangerous and have been proven to cause both physical and mental harm in young people,\" added New York Attorney General Letitia James. Facebook Files: 5 things leaked documents reveal\nFacebook under fire over secret teen research Facebook, which owns Instagram and WhatsApp changed its name to Meta last month after a series of scandals. A Meta spokesman pushed back against the consortium's allegations. \"These accusations are false and demonstrate a deep misunderstanding of the facts,\" a spokesman said in a statement. \"While challenges in protecting young people online impact the entire industry, we've led the industry in combating bullying and supporting people struggling with suicidal thoughts, self-injury, and eating disorders,\" he added. The announcement comes after a series of explosive reports based on of documents leaked by former Facebook employee Frances Haugen. In testimony to lawmakers in the US, she said the company knowingly pushed its platforms to young children despite knowing that they could cause health issues. In September, the platform abandoned plans for a child-focused app after a group of over 40 state attorneys general wrote and urged them to cancel it. Instagram, like other platforms, requires users to be over 13, but the company has admitted that it knows some users are younger. When Meta's CEO Zuckerberg responded to Frances Haugen's leaks he said something intriguing. \"If we attack organisations making an effort to study their impact on the world, we're effectively sending the message that it's safer not to look at all, in case you find something that could be held against you.\" What Zuckerberg was essentially saying is if companies get whacked for conducting research into the effects of their products - they won't conduct the research at all. It's important because Instagram is by no means the only social media platform that teens use. TikTok for example has an enormous teen following, as does Snapchat. How do they affect teen mental health? Well we don't know, because if they have conducted this research, they haven't released it. This is Meta' great grievance - that it is facing the consequences of bothering to understand the impact of their products. But that isn't quite right either. The nature of Instagram, its algorithmic push that promotes beauty, style, success - is different to other apps. It would be far better if Facebook gave its data to independent analysts to able to research harmful effects. But it would be far worse if the company simply stopped looking under the bonnet, in case it found something it didn't like. ",

            "header": "Cladding crisis: 'Some days I can't leave the house'",
            "content": "\"It's like a crippling depression where you can't get up. My anxiety is really bad, some days I can't leave the house.\" Sophie Grayling, 28, bought a two-bed flat in Chelmsford, Essex just weeks after her son Reuben was born in 2017. It was supposed to be a safe, secure place to bring up a child, but all that quickly changed. In December 2020, the mother-of-one was told the building had dangerous external cladding and as a result, the sale on her property fell through. Since then, she tells the BBC she has felt \"trapped and helpless\", living constantly in fear that she might lose the roof over her head and have to declare bankruptcy. Concerns over building safety were triggered by the Grenfell Tower fire in 2017 in which 72 people died. An inquiry found the type of cladding used was the primary cause of the fire's rapid spread. It's estimated more than half a million people are still living in flats with dangerous cladding and flammable materials. Some are facing bills of more than £100,000 to make their properties safe. New research, shared exclusively with the BBC by the University of Sheffield and UK Collaborative Centre for Housing Evidence, concluded the building safety crisis is having a \"catastrophic impact on the mental health of some leaseholders\". Dr Jenny Preece's research is based on a series of in-depth interviews carried out over the summer with affected leaseholders from England and Wales. \"Several people talked about a point of crisis and needing to get help from a GP; they felt trapped and it was leading to feelings of suicide and self-harm,\" she said. \"Some participants were taking anti-depressants as a result of the mental health impact of the problems they were living with: you're stuck and there's literally nothing you can do about it.\" The impacts were likened to living through \"ongoing trauma\". Leaseholders talked about the loss of control over their own lives, the inability to plan for the future, no timeframe for building safety problems to be resolved and the crippling financial burden on their shoulders. Another cladding victim, Will Martin, 33, described it as being \"like a ball and chain wrapped around your legs\". Mr Martin is a junior doctor who owns a flat in Sheffield with dangerous cladding. He is the co-founder of the campaign Organisation UK Cladding Action Group and has helped to organise nationwide protests and demonstrations. That has been his coping mechanism, but Mr Martin says he deeply regrets his decision ever to buy a flat. \"I was so embarrassed and utterly ashamed that I, a sensible person, made this colossal mistake and error of judgement by buying this property. The last four years and the impact it has had on my mental health will stay with me forever. It has been torturous,\" he said. \"Government has always said 'leaseholders should not have to pay', but the reality is that many face a constant barrage of entirely unaffordable bills and, in addition to paying through their pockets, today's research by the University of Sheffield lays bare the mental health costs faced by many on a daily basis.\" Back in Essex, Ms Grayling went to her GP for help and was prescribed anti-anxiety medication. Her doctor was so shocked by the situation he wrote to her local MP, Vicky Ford, asking for the issues to be raised in Parliament. \"Sophie feels utterly trapped. She cannot remortgage, she cannot sell.\" Last year, the House of Commons Housing Select Committee, made up of a group of cross-party MPs, warned that the cladding scandal was becoming a public health crisis. Psychologists have told the BBC that people living in these conditions for long periods of time will need counselling and therapy to get through it. Professor Sir Cary Cooper is a leading stress expert and occupational psychologist at the University of Manchester. \"In life, uncertainty and lack of control are the two leading causes of stress, and these people have it in tonnes,\" said Professor Cooper. \"Number one, you know you are going to have to cough up some money. Number two, you don't know how much and it could be substantial. So the worries about that, on top of everything else, these people really do need support and they will need counselling support.\" According to Dr Preece, the financial burden, rather than safety concerns, has often been the great source of concern for leaseholders: \"If we don't see a change in policy or government action where is it going end?\" Her report makes a series of recommendations, including urging the government to carry out an audit of the number of buildings affected and extend the funding to cover buildings of all heights and all types of fire safety faults. It also calls for a taskforce to be established to pursue residential developers and manufacturers of cladding materials for compensation. Ms Grayling's building in Chelmsford is less than 18 metres in height, and, therefore, not eligible for government funding to fix the faults. But after months of uncertainty, the developer of her block has now agreed to pay to remove and replace the dangerous cladding. She hopes she may soon be able to sell the flat and move on with her life. \"I am at the tip of the iceberg, I feel lucky,\" she says. \"I have support from friends and family [and] my love for my son got me through, pulled me out of the deepest despair and meant I did get help.\" The government has promised a £5bn Building Safety Fund to remove flammable cladding on high-rise buildings of above 18 metres in height, but MPs have estimated the total cost would be £15bn. A Department for Levelling Up Housing and Communities (DLUHC) spokesperson said the department would be setting out \"further proposals in due course\" to support leaseholders in low and mid-rise blocks. \"It is unacceptable and unfair that leaseholders are facing excessive bills - they are innocent parties in this and we recognise the impact it can have on their mental health,\" the DLUHC spokesperson said. \"Building owners and industry must make buildings safe without passing on costs to leaseholders. \"Most blocks of flats are safe and do not need expensive works, and we continue to drive extreme risk aversion out of the market, by encouraging a more proportionate, evidence-based approach from lenders and insurers.\" ",

            "content": "Facebook has written to the Los Angeles Police Department (LAPD), demanding that it stop setting up fake profiles to conduct surveillance on users. This comes after the Guardian revealed that the US police department had been working with a tech firm, analysing user data to help solve crimes. Facebook expressly prohibits the creation and use of fake accounts. The intent, it said, was to \"create a safe environment where people can trust and hold one another accountable\". \"Not only do LAPD instructional documents use Facebook as an explicit example in advising officers to set up fake social media accounts, but documents also indicate that LAPD policies simply allow officers to create fake accounts for 'online investigative activity',\" wrote Facebook's vice president and deputy general counsel for civil rights Roy Austin in a letter outlining Facebook's policies. \"While the legitimacy of such policies may be up to the LAPD, officers must abide by Facebook's policies when creating accounts on our services. The Police Department should cease all activities on Facebook that involve the use of fake accounts, impersonation of others, and collection of data for surveillance purposes.\" Documents obtained through public record requests made by non-profit organisation the Brennan Center of Justice showed that in 2019, the LAPD had been using Voyager Labs' social media surveillance software to collect data from suspects' social media networks, including their friends' accounts. Voyager Labs claims its software is able to analyse large amounts data to help solve crimes, including helping to discern users' motives and beliefs. The LAPD said in emails that the software had been particularly useful in investigating the activities of street gangs online and crucial in helping its robbery and homicide division collect evidence. Facebook argues that spying on users and impersonating legitimate users goes against its purpose, which is to enable people to \"connect and share with real people using their authentic identities\". However, Robert Potter, an Australian security expert specialising in lawful surveillance, thinks fake names can be justified in situations where human rights activists or journalists are seeking to protect their privacy online, or for users in countries where there is internet censorship. And he is surprised at the social network's strong stance against the LAPD, when it has been slow to take action in the past on issues like misleading political ads, online scams and social media's negative effects on teenagers. \"It's genuinely interesting to see that Facebook has become the nexus for so many problematic communications, from child trafficking and terrorism communications to Covid disinformation,\" he told the BBC. \"Yet they seem to care more about the LAPD misusing their platform than sometimes they do about China or Russia.\" Despite its claims regarding authenticity and accountability, in August the social network banned the accounts of US academics researching political ads on its platform. Facebook said the researchers' data-scraping browser extension tool undermined its security, while the academics argued that their work was vital in maintaining democracy and keeping the social network's practices transparent. \"If you're not cracking down across the board on malicious actors using your platform, you don't have strong grounds to crack down on legitimate use of the platform,\" said Mr Potter, who built the Washington Post's cyber-security operations centre and has advised the Australian government on cyber-security. \"You're not special if you run a social media platform. If there's not a rule saying you can't have an undercover cop in a church, why should a social media platform be any different?\" ",

Its remaining stores, which sell a wide range of consumer goods and snack foods, will be beefed up to offer more in-person health services. Through the pandemic, Americans have grown increasingly accustomed to accessing advice, testing and vaccinations at their local drugstore. CVS, along with other pharmacy chains, have played a leading part in rolling out Covid-19 vaccines in the US, in particular. Pfizer to let poorer nations make new Covid pill\nAstraZeneca to take profits from Covid vaccine\nAntiviral Covid pill 89% effective, Pfizer says CVS Health Corp, which operates more than 9,900 locations across the US, said it had been planning to expand the services it offered since it acquired health insurer Aetna in 2018. The retailer said it would start closing stores in the spring of 2022, shutting 300 branches a year over three years, although it has not yet identified which shops will close. At its remaining sites, CVS plans to expand its health hubs that offer treatments for every day health problems, as well as chronic care. CVS said the long term strategy was to expand care delivery, while shrinking its bricks-and-mortar retail business. \"Our retail stores are fundamental to our strategy and who we are as a company,\" the company's chief executive Karen Lynch said. \"We remain focused on the competitive advantage provided by our presence in thousands of communities across the country, which complements our rapidly expanding digital presence.\" CVS is the US's largest pharmacy chain, ahead of chief rival Walgreens Boots Alliance. Analyst Neil Saunders, managing director of GlobalData, said the decision makes sense considering \"CVS has neglected stores for far too long and has pushed some of them into the downward spiral of irrelevance\". Walgreens also recently shifted its focus, investing in other care providers, namely $5.2bn (£3.9bn) in healthcare provider VillageMD and $330m in health services provider CareCentrix. ",

            "header": "Making tracks across the border",
            "content": "Give and take in the new rail plans for the north of England and Midlands have created winners, losers and disappointment.\nHigh-speed rail plans as they affect Scotland are not much changed - with reduced travel times almost entirely because of improvements to tracks and capacity in the south. But choices are yet to be made on how fast London trains will be, depending how often they have to stop.\nThe UK government is yet to set out its plans for improved transport connections across the UK's internal borders, but they could be arriving soon. In terms of \"levelling up\" the left-behind bits of Britain, rail is a test case of what that means and whether it's serious. With some give and some take, one of the more generous assessments is that UK ministers' \"integrated rail\" plan has delivered a very British outcome - \"a half-built railway\". Without managing expectations and by pulling back on past plans, a lot of money is being deployed in the building of a lot of disappointment. There were expectations of high speed services reaching Leeds and transforming the grim infrastructure that has long failed to link northern mill towns to the modern world. Past plans have now been revised and costs cut. And in the small print, note that plans will still have to go through the financial gateways, which the Treasury controls like fortifications. HS2 rail extension to Leeds scrapped\nWhat is HS2 and where will it go? So what does it mean for Scotland and links to the south? As with air connections, remember not just to see this as a means of getting out of Scotland. Transport also brings in visitors for business and leisure, and rail is a travel option that cuts down on aviation and road emissions. That environmental rail advantage is more important for Scotland because speed and length of journey makes the aircraft a serious competitor to the long-distance train, in a way that it rarely does in England. Cancellation of the new high speed link between Leeds and points south could diminish the range of options for travellers linking further north with Edinburgh and the east of Scotland, particularly if journeys are to the the north of England and Midlands. Journeys between Scotland and England have seen faster growth for destination Manchester and Birmingham than the growth for London. All of them have been growing a lot in recent decades. The Victorian rail network that built spokes in and out of London is unlike the modern demand for services that aren't about the metropolis. And that growth in passenger numbers is why capacity - and particularly in the southern portions of the journey, as population becomes more dense - is a constraint that has to be addressed. That can be done with more tracks, longer trains and smarter signalling, as well as faster trains. Apart from Leeds, the impact on Scottish links with English cities is not as great as the change that will or won't take place across the north of England. It remains the case that a journey that typically takes four and a half hours from London to Glasgow should be cut by about 50 minutes, once HS2 has reached a point near Wigan. At that point, a northbound train will transfer off high-speed tracks, and as it continues north, it won't be able to go as fast. The east coast line, from Edinburgh through York and Peterborough to London, is to get an upgrade. That is badly needed. Rail campaigners point to ageing overhead gantries and the failure to provide sufficient electric power for the newest trains north of Newcastle, meaning that at least some of them have to switch to diesel. If the new plans for \"integrated rail\" do as promised on the east coast line, that could cut journey times by 20 minutes between Newcastle and London. But the plans give no indication of improvements north of the Tyne. Rail campaigners say there could be improvements to speed up these long-distance services on tracks north of the border. Most of these would use existing line, in some cases and places adding parallel tracks so that slower trains don't get in the way of the fast ones. That could cut Glasgow to London journeys to only three hours, but that depends how often they stop. If the priority is to link Scotland with London in order to reduce demand for air travel, then the priority should be very few stops and the minimum possible journey time. A rough reckoning by the rail industry is that a cut in journey time from 4 hours 30 minutes to 3 hours 40 should knock out about half of the demand for London air links with Scotland's central belt. Taking it down to three hours could replace air travel. But there are other priorities in the north of England. \"Levelling up\" means services that stop and don't hurtle past English towns in order to suit Scottish travellers. It was recently reported that a Scottish government official had admitted to a transport conference that plans for improving rail connectivity with England have been shunted into a siding for the past couple of years. That appears to reflect a lack of co-operation between Whitehall and St Andrew's House. Even if it has stopped its own work in high speed rail, the Scottish government remains keen on the UK government pushing on. Said a spokesperson at Transport Scotland: \"We have consistently supported HS2 from the outset and called for it to extend further north to Scotland, recognising the benefits this will bring from the improvements in the connectivity, capacity and resilience of the rail network, in addition to a welcome reduction in journey times. \"It is therefore disappointing that the ambition for HS2 has been scaled back rather than expand by bringing it north of Border.\" A strategic transport projects review is expected this winter, with a 20-year time horizon. Boris Johnson's government wants to be seen to be improving cross-border links of all sorts, and on its own terms for political reasons. A \"union connectivity review\" has been long-awaited. Its first draft pointed to improvements to the road links to Northern Ireland through Scotland. It could also take on the hopes of a railway that links the new Edinburgh-Border railway with Carlisle. Stand by for a tannoy announcement that the review will be arriving at a UK government platform in the next few weeks. ",

This type of fraud rose by 71% in the first half of the year. At present, refunds by banks are governed by a voluntary code which consumer groups argue has been a lottery for scam victims. Regulators will also force the UK's 14 big banking groups to publish data on fraud reimbursement. A total of £355m was lost through so-called authorised push payment (APP) fraud cases in the first half of the year. Victims pay fraudsters who they believe are genuine organisations, such as banks, the police, or solicitors. These scams accounted for a significant chunk of the £754m lost in total to fraud during the same period. Banks have interpreted a voluntary code differently, meaning some victims are refunded while others are not, in seemingly similar circumstances. Customers are also unaware of the frequency of cases involving their own banks, and what proportion of victims are reimbursed by their bank. Under the plans, which are under consultation until January, legislation would be changed to ensure blameless victims are refunded. The Payments Systems Regulator also said that large banks and building societies would need to publish data on APP scams, including reimbursement levels for victims. They would include the AIB Group (UK), Bank of Scotland, Barclays, Clydesdale Bank, the Co-operative Bank, HSBC, Lloyds, Metro Bank, Monzo, NatWest/RBS, Nationwide Building Society, Northern Bank, Santander, Starling Bank, TSB, Ulster Bank and Virgin Money.

We agree that more needs to be done and have long called for a regulated code, backed by legislation, to ensure consumer protections apply consistently.\" However, she said that other organisations, such as social media and online platforms, needed to play their part in tackling fraud as well.

Local service upgrades, bringing faster journeys, will happen up to 10 years earlier than planned, ministers say. The plan will cost £96bn, but only half of that is thought to be new money. It comes as businesses reacted angrily to reports the East Midlands-Leeds HS2 high-speed line would not be built. However, campaigners against the HS2 have said they are \"elated\" by the reports. Transport Secretary Grant Shapps will unveil the plans this morning. Speaking to the BBC, Deputy Prime Minister Dominic Raab denied that the government was rowing back on promises to \"level up\" the country with HS2. He called the new plan \"good for the whole country\", adding: \"We are entirely delivering on the aspiration and ambition of the levelling up agenda.\" The Department for Transport (DfT) says its Integrated Rail Plan (IRP) will improve journey times and capacity \"from London and across the Pennines\" and \"strengthen connections between major cities in the North and Midlands\".

Writing in the Yorkshire Post, Mr Johnson appears to confirm reports that a shorter high-speed route will be created from Birmingham to East Midlands Parkway, with the HS2 trains then running up as far as Sheffield on mainline tracks. In his article Mr Johnson wrote: \"HS2 will come to Sheffield, meaning a trip to or from London will take just one hour 27 minutes - precisely the same as under the old HS2 plans. \"We'll look at how to get HS2 to Leeds too, with a new study on the best way to make it happen. \"But high-speed rail is grindingly slow to build. Under the original blueprint, first drawn up more than a decade ago, Yorkshire would have not have seen the benefits of our investment until at least the 2040s. Levelling up can't wait that long.\" The government is also expected to put money aside to explore setting up a tram service for Leeds and spend £360m on contactless ticketing across commuter rail networks. The IRP was initiated after the 2020 Oakervee Review into major transport schemes including HS2 and Northern Powerhouse Rail (NPR). But the prime minister has come under pressure recently over claims the government intends to \"water down\" planned rail upgrades. There has been outcry from some politicians and businesses in the north of England at reports that there will not be an entire new fast line between Leeds and Manchester, via Bradford. The improvements to the NPR east-west connections are likely to involve upgrades to existing infrastructure. Tracy Brabin, Labour Mayor for West Yorkshire, told the BBC: \"If what we're hearing is true, it's a betrayal of the North and a betrayal of the people I represent. \"It's going to affect our potential and investment and opportunity, and it's just not good enough.\" However, earlier this week, Sandra Haith, from an anti-HS2 campaign group in Bramley, Rotherham, said she was \"absolutely elated\", saying the proposed route would have brought \"untold devastation\" and \"heartbreak\" to communities along the line. Nick Garthwaite, director of chemical manufacturer Christeyns Ltd in Bradford and vice chair of the West & North Yorkshire Chamber of Commerce, says he is disappointed by the reports that a new line between Manchester and Leeds may not be built. \"I feel the city and its people have been betrayed - we might not get the through railway station that Bradford so desperately needs and indeed was tacitly promised by government over a long period of time,\" he told the BBC. A key concern for businesses in Bradford is trying to attract more talent to come to work there, so not having good transport links is a problem. \"What I'm worried about is that these young talented people in Bradford will be thinking twice about staying in the city,\" he said. Mr Garthwaite said it was likely that businesses would also consider locating new factories in other parts of England. His concerns seem to be shared by others. A student told the BBC that many young people were now moving away from Bradford and Leeds to live in cities like Nottingham and Manchester, because the transport links were so poor. \"I'm definitely not going to be staying in Leeds or Bradford because it's not reliable enough,\" she said. Speaking to the PA news agency on Tuesday, Transport Secretary Grant Shapps said: \"[People in the North] should definitely feel optimistic. \"Not only are we going to spend a huge amount of money doing this, we are going to deliver it decades before it would have otherwise happened.\" Mr Shapps added that if he had been transport secretary 15 years ago with responsibility for HS2, then \"I would have started in the North and moved south, I think that would have made sense\". He went on: \"The Northern Powerhouse Rail, the Midlands Connect - all of those did not exist when HS2 was first mooted, but we are where we are and it's being built and we need to make sure we connect it all up and that's what the Integrated Rail Plan intends to achieve.\" However, Henri Murison, director of the Northern Powerhouse Partnership, told the BBC's Today programme: \"I think we've got a real risk of disappointment across the North. \"The budget that's been promised, £96bn, is about £30bn less than the previous plans and what we were being offered. That means real cuts on the eastern leg, real cuts to the new line across the Pennines through Bradford.\" He said it was now vital to ensure better connectivity between Leeds and Sheffield, as the North was \"going to lose on that connectivity to the West Midlands and London\". Mick Whelan, general secretary of train drivers' union Aslef, accused the government of using \"smoke and mirrors\" while breaking its promises. \"HS2 was meant to be a world-beater... instead, the Tories are letting us down,\" he said. \"This government is a government of broken promises. It has announced Northern Powerhouse Rail an incredible 60 times - and I know because we've counted - and now it puts the project in the bin.\" Do you live or work in Nottingham, Bradford or Leeds?

            "content": "UK employers should stop asking jobseekers about their previous salaries, a campaign group is urging. The Fawcett Society says asking about previous pay when recruiting contributes to the gender pay gap, by keeping women on lower wages. Its survey of 2,200 working adults found that 47% of people had been asked about past salaries. Meanwhile, 61% of women said the question had an impact on their confidence to negotiate better pay. The Fawcett Society's chief executive Jemima Olchawski told the BBC that unless more is done, the gender pay gap will not be closed until at least 2050. \"We're calling on employers to make a simple change and stop asking potential employees about salary history,\" she said. \"Evidence shows that this will help to stamp out pay inequality, not only for women but for people of colour, and people with disabilities.\" Workers call the shots as job vacancies boom\nWhere are all the job vacancies?\nFirms step up graduate pay amid fierce competition The campaign group warned that asking prospective candidates about their salary history meant companies could end up replicating gender pay gaps from other organisations. The survey also found that 58% of women and 54% of men felt salary history questions meant they were offered a lower wage than they might otherwise have been paid. Only a quarter of people feel that pay should be based on past salaries, compared to 80% of respondents, who felt that their pay should be based on their skill and responsibilities. The campaign group also found that 77% of people felt their salaries should reflect the value of the work they do. The report added that the pace of change to close the gender pay gap was \"glacial\". The Fawcett Society stressed that more needed to be done by the government and employers to tackle its causes, such as stamping out discrimination. Peter Cheese, head of the Chartered Institute of Personnel and Development (CIPD), agrees that setting pay grades based on what people were paid in previous jobs can \"exacerbate the problem\". But he believed questions about previous salaries were legitimate. \"I'm not convinced that employers should never ask about previous pay because it's not an unnatural question to ask,\" he told the BBC. \"Indeed, prospective employees will tend to raise their expectations about pay and that's a perfectly natural question in the recruitment process.\" He said that the issue was becoming prominent now because the UK was in a tight labour market with \"upwards pressure\" on pay. \"We need to be honest about that - if we think we can get away with paying the absolute minimum, we might be disappointed about our ability to recruit,\" Mr Cheese added. \"What we want is to encourage employers to be transparent about how they pay; the basis under which they pay and how that reflects things like market dynamics; and that they communicate that to their own organisation, as well as to external recruits.\" ",

            "content": "Amazon will stop accepting Visa credit cards issued in the UK from 19 January, the online retail giant has said. It said the move was due to high credit card transaction fees but said Visa debit cards would still be accepted. Visa said it was \"very disappointed that Amazon is threatening to restrict consumer choice in the future\". Amazon said: \"The cost of accepting card payments continues to be an obstacle for businesses striving to provide the best prices for customers.\" The online retailer said costs should be going down over time due to advances in technology, \"but instead they continue to stay high or even rise\". An Amazon spokesperson said the dispute was to do with \"pretty egregious\" price rises from Visa over a number of years with no additional value to its service. Amazon is offering £20 for Prime customers to switch from using Visa to an alternative payment method, and £10 for other customers, if they have a Visa cards as their default or only payment method on their account. Visa said in a statement it was \"very disappointed that Amazon is threatening to restrict consumer choice in the future. When consumer choice is limited, nobody wins.\" It said it had \"a long-standing relationship with Amazon\" and that it was trying to resolve the situation so customers would be able to use Visa credit cards with Amazon UK. Amazon declined to say how much Visa charges the retailer to process transactions made on credit cards. Visa also declined to comment though it claimed that on average it takes less than 0.1% of the value of a purchase. Amazon and Visa said any changes in fees had nothing to do with Brexit. Both Visa and its rival Mastercard have raised the so-called interchange fee on cross-border transactions between businesses in the UK and the European Union following Brexit. The dispute between Amazon and Visa is to do with the fees the credit card company charges Amazon for its services in the UK. Amazon is also considering dropping Visa as a partner for its US co-branded credit card. It is in talks with payment networks, including Mastercard, American Express and Visa - as part of what it calls a standard process, the BBC has learnt. This row between two corporate titans is now being played out in full view of their customers. Amazon says Visa's fees are excessive, and an obstacle to low prices for consumers. Visa says its fees are competitive, has minimal effect on prices, and that nobody wins when choice is restricted. Whether or not this row is about fees, or whether that is just a smokescreen is largely irrelevant to consumers using these services. They just know they may have to change the way they pay on Amazon. Yet, the timing is significant. These messages to customers hit home harder when people are regularly using Amazon for Christmas shopping. But it also means there is still time before January 19 for a compromise to be reached. James Andrews, senior personal finance editor at comparison website Money.co.uk, said the move \"will come as a blow to the millions of Britons\" who use Visa credit cards, including Barclaycard and HSBC customers. \"With American Express also rejected by many UK retailers, that means people looking for rewards on their spending or trying to split the cost of shopping with a 0% purchase card on Amazon will be effectively forced to choose a Mastercard,\" he said. He added that a rewards card that is offered by Amazon is \"powered by Mastercard\". Mastercard's executive vice chairman Ann Cairns, said: \"It's very important that customers have choice, and have the widest variety of ability to pay, whether that's through cards or from their bank accounts or cash, and remember that it is never the consumer that pays fees.\" \"We talk to Amazon all the time because obviously we are two big global businesses and Amazon is one of our top customers around the world.\" Retail analyst Steve Dresser said in a tweet that Amazon could be aiming to bring Visa fees down with its move. The BBC is not responsible for the content of external sites.\nView original tweet on Twitter The Federation of Small Businesses (FSB) said credit card fees \"charged by the handful of card providers which dominate the cashless payment space have soared in recent years\". \"Small businesses are almost always charged more for card terminals than big corporates - so when online giants start throwing down the gauntlet, you know the situation is becoming critical,\" said FSB national chairman Mike Cherry. Businesses have had ongoing concerns about credit card fees from the major providers. Last October, Visa and Mastercard were accused by the British Retail Consortium (BRC) of charging excessive fees. The trade body said they had doubled in two years. At the time, the BRC warned that retailers would be forced to pass on costs to consumers, with credit card bills rising by up to £40. The Payment Systems Regulator said there were \"real questions about how well the cards market is working\". \"We will look into how well this market is working, including the issue of increasing card fees,\" a spokesman for the regulator said. \"If necessary we will intervene to address any issues we identify.\" He said a final strategy would be published in the new year.

            "content": "House of Fraser's flagship Oxford Street store will close its doors for good in January. The Art Deco building will be turned into an office block with shops, a gym and a rooftop restaurant. Westminster City Council gave the green light to redevelopment plans and the landlord has now given notice to quit. Owner Fraser Group has blamed \"archaic business rates\" and warns further closures are \"inevitable\" without reform. Number 318 Oxford Street has been a feature of London's most famous retail avenue for decades. It was purpose-built as a department store and traded under the name of DH Evans until it was rebranded as House of Fraser in 2001. Fraser Group, formerly known as Sports Direct International plc, took ownership of the store in 2018 but its tenure has come to an end. Westminster councillors unanimously approved the plans, which will see £100m spent on revamping the building. West End ward councillor Tim Barnes, who spoke in support of the plans at the meeting, welcomed the proposal. Wooing shoppers back to Oxford Street\nAlmost 50 shops a day disappear from High Streets\nTopshop's Oxford Street store up for sale \"Oxford Street has suffered particularly badly during the pandemic, but Covid-19 just accelerated changes to retail habits that were already taking place,\" he said. \"By investing in this flagship building and creating a vibrant mix of uses, the vibrancy of Oxford Street can be assured for residents, visitors and workers.\" Andrew Davidson, a partner at architects PDP London, said the landmark store would now undergo a \"once-in-a-hundred-year\" transformation. He said the building, which dates back to 1937, would become \"a vibrant and flexible mixed-use destination, where Londoners will enjoy working, keeping fit, shopping and relaxing\". New owner, Publica Properties Establishment, will demolish the two existing top floors and build three new floors, making the building eight storeys high. A rooftop restaurant will be created with 360 degree views across London and access to external terraces. Offices and shops will fill the remaining storeys, with lower floors being converted into a gym and a basement swimming pool. A Fraser Group spokesman warned that dozens of other House of Fraser stores across the UK were now at risk. He said: \"As a business which is continuing to invest significantly into the British High Street, we feel it's only fair to recognise and request an urgent review of the current archaic business rates, which continue to be astonishingly outdated. \"If business rates were reviewed it would support the future of House of Fraser. Without this, further store closures are inevitable.\" A spokesman for the Treasury said the budget last month froze the business rates multiplier and provided almost £1.7bn in further business rates relief for 2022-23. He said: \"We've just concluded a review of business rates. \"We think a tax on the use and value of commercial property remains an important part of a balanced business tax system and we're making changes to make their operation fairer and more effective for businesses.\" ",

            "content": "Apple has announced a \"self-service repair\" programme so \"customers who are comfortable\" can fix their own devices. At launch, in early 2022 in the US, it will cover replacing the batteries, screens and cameras of recent iPhones. But Apple's new repair store will sell more than 200 parts and tools. It comes after months of increasing pressure on Apple from the grassroots right-to-repair movement, which wants individuals and independent repair shops to be able to fix electronics. \"Self Service Repair is intended for individual technicians with the knowledge and experience to repair electronic devices,\" Apple said. But \"for the vast majority of customers\" visiting a certified professional repair shop would be a better option. \"Creating greater access to Apple genuine parts gives our customers even more choice if a repair is needed,\" Apple chief operating officer Jeff Williams said. \"By designing products for durability, longevity, and increased repairability, customers enjoy a long-lasting product that holds its value for years,\" the company said. Apple has often been held up as one of the fiercest opponents of the right to repair, claiming safety issues. Independent repair-instructions website iFixit, which recently took Apple to task for making it much harder to repair iPhone screens, tweeted: \"We never thought we'd see the day.\" The BBC is not responsible for the content of external sites.\nView original tweet on Twitter \"Apple has long claimed that letting consumers fix their own stuff would be dangerous,\" iFixit said in a statement to media. \"Now, with renewed governmental interest in repair markets - and soon after notably bad press... Apple has found unexpected interest in letting people fix the things they own.\" And Canadian computer hardware reviewers Hardware Canucks wrote: \"It may be a small step overall - but for Apple to do it, this is a massive win for the right-to-repair movement.\" Apple said the Self Service Repair programme would allow individual customers to \"join more than 5,000 Apple authorised service providers and 2,800 independent repair providers who have access to these parts, tools, and manuals\". It had been expanding its authorised repair network, so access to official parts \"has nearly doubled\" in the past three years, it said. But Apple's authorised repair schemes have long been criticised for having extensive terms and restrictions such as where the replacement parts come from - making it unlikely a random component from a broken phone could easily be harvested and \"transplanted\" for repair. And the company maintains tight controls on the pricing of those components. The right-to-repair movement has attracted much attention in recent years, with several US states considering \"fair repair\" legislation. Right-to-repair movement gains ground\nApple co-founder backs right-to-repair movement And earlier this year, Apple co-founder Steve Wozniak - who built the first Apple computers in a garage with Steve Jobs in the 1970s - came out in favour of the movement. \"We wouldn't have had an Apple had I not grown up in a very open technology world,\" he said, in July.

The event is at the Arc Shopping Centre in Bury St Edmunds, Suffolk runs from 26 November until Christmas Eve. People have jokingly asked if they needed to bring a shovel, while others have said omitting the words St Edmunds from its name was a \"massive faux pas\". The town's mayor said that, given the attention it had attracted, maybe it was \"marketing genius\". On the Arc Shopping Centre's Facebook page, one person said calling the event the Bury Santa Experience was a \"bit dark\". Another said: \"Where are we burying him? Do I need my own shovel?\"  James Sheen, from the We Love Bury St Edmunds Facebook group, said: \"To omit the words St Edmunds is a massive faux pas, how could they be so stupid?\" But the town's Conservative mayor Peter Thompson said he was not sure if it was a \"faux pas or marketing genius\". \"Perhaps it's been thought through perfectly because it's been shared far and wide - tickets are selling very well,\" he said.

Organisers said it would include a trail through an \"enchanted forest\" before families reached Santa's Toyshop and finish the experience visiting Father Christmas in his grotto. Mr Thompson said the £20,000 invested by the town council was \"without doubt\" worth it. \"It's already been a success. When we look at the ticket sales that are online, it will soon be sold out, and Christmas Eve is already sold out,\" he said.

            "content": "Workers at game-development titan Activision Blizzard have staged a walkout, after reports chief executive Bobby Kotick had long been aware of harassment allegations. The Wall Street Journal published an extensive investigation into the company, alleging Mr Kotick had \"intervened\" in at least one case. Mr Kotick called the report \"inaccurate and misleading\". He has not been personally accused of any misconduct amid the scandal. The scandal erupted in July, when the company, which makes Call of Duty and World of Warcraft, was sued by the state of California over its \"frat boy\" culture. And in the months since, the company has lost several key senior staff, including the namesake of one of its popular characters. Separately, Blizzard head J Allen Brack stepped down in August, in the immediate aftermath of the revelations and following an initial staff walkout. More than 20 Activision staff leave after claims\nThe perfect storm striking World of Warcraft The newspaper's investigation said Mr Kotick had been aware of sexual-misconduct claims \"for years\", including at least one rape allegation as far back as 2018, but failed to report the matter to the board of directors. It also alleged when a senior figure at one of the publisher's studios was accused of sexual harassment, and an internal investigation launched, Mr Kotick \"intervened to keep him\". Mr Kotick is also accused of leaving a voicemail, in 2006, threatening to kill a female member of staff. The Wall Street Journal also covered a previously reported incident, from 2007, when he was accused of firing a flight attendant on his private jet after she complained of sexual harassment by the pilot. Both cases were settled out of court. After the report was published, the ABK Workers Alliance - an employee's group for Activision's umbrella of companies - tweeted it was staging a walkout later that day and calling for Mr Kotick to step down. The BBC is not responsible for the content of external sites.\nView original tweet on Twitter Supporters estimated 150 people had gathered outside one of the main offices in Irvine, California, despite the short notice. Games journalist Jason Schreier, whose reporting specialises in internal industry mechanics and working conditions, tweeted the turnout was \"an impressive number, considering it was called two hours ago (and most employees are working from home)\". The Wall Street Journal's extensive report also alleged Jennifer Oneal, who stepped in to lead Blizzard amid the scandal, had sent an email, in September, detailing her personal experience of sexual harassment and expressing a lack of faith in the company to change its culture. She also recalled a 2007 company event involving strippers, which Mr Kotick attended, the newspaper said. Earlier this month, Activision announced Ms Oneal would leave the company at the end of the year. Mr Kotick pre-empted publication of the Wall Street Journal's report by sending a video message to all employees, on Tuesday, stressing his efforts to reform the company amid the scandal. \"There will, of course, be continued media attention about us and our industry over the next few months,\" he said, according to an official transcript. \"In fact, there's an article today that paints an inaccurate and misleading view of our company, of me personally, and my leadership. \"Anyone who doubts my conviction to be the most welcoming, inclusive workplace doesn't really appreciate how important this is to me.\" Activision said it was \"disappointed in the Wall Street Journal's report, which presents a misleading view of Activision Blizzard and our CEO\". \"Instances of sexual misconduct that were brought to his attention were acted upon,\" a representative said, alleging changes being made currently were being ignored. \"The constant desire to be better has always set this company apart. \"Which is why, at Mr Kotick's direction, we have made significant improvements, including a zero-tolerance policy for inappropriate conduct.\" The board of directors also issued a statement, saying: \"The board remains confident that Bobby Kotick appropriately addressed workplace issues brought to his attention. \"The goals we have set for ourselves are both critical and ambitious. \"The board remains confident in Bobby Kotick's leadership, commitment and ability to achieve these goals.\" ",

            "content": "One of Scotland's most successful technology teams is starting again with a new firm - and has secured the biggest initial investment of any British start-up company. BetDEX is being led by Nigel Eccles, who co-founded fantasy sports betting website FanDuel in 2009 in Edinburgh. The new firm has seed funding of $21m. It aims to launch a new open source software platform, on which others can innovate in sports betting, in the first half of next year. The company is recruiting staff from a base in Scotland. FanDuel was sold to Flutter - formerly named Paddy Power Betfair - in 2018 and is now worth more than $30bn. However, Mr Eccles and other co-founders are in legal dispute with FanDuel's later stage investors over the way in which they structured a takeover, which left the Edinburgh team without a share of the rising valuation. Mr Eccles said that one thing he learned from the FanDuel experience was to choose investors carefully. He told BBC Scotland: \"We took a lot of lessons from that, one of which was the importance of who we pick as investors in this new business, to ensure their values are aligned with ours, that they take their fiduciary duties responsibly, and that they're the right partners for us.\" The $21m seed funding for BetDEX includes stakes taken by seven backers of US technology firms, including two large funds - Paradigm and FTX - which specialise in investing in companies operating with crypto-currencies. Varun Sudhakar, chief executive of BetDEX, said: \"The sports betting industry charges high prices for poor products and limits trades by its most successful users. \"BetDEX is diametrically opposed to this approach. We will successfully compete against incumbents with a markedly superior product and low fees, which is now possible with the advent of the blockchain technology.\" As chairman of the new firm, Mr Eccles said it could look familiar to retail punters used to existing online firms. However, he says that those who use its platform to run their own betting firms will be able to innovate and create a wider range of betting products. He said the typical share taken by online bookies is 7% to 10% of a stake, but BetDEX should allow for that to fall below 1%. The company will develop its own betting apps to operate on the platform. Mr Eccles said these would take an \"intelligent, thoughtful\" approach to the way they are marketed to protect those who struggle with problem gambling. He said the team of around 500 software engineers who helped build FanDuel from Scotland showed that it remains the place to build a firm. BetDEX has the same head of technology, Stuart Tonner. \"A lot of that [FanDuel] success was built on a highly skilled, very talented engineering team, that built this product that could process millions of bets and millions of users. \"There's a real talent pool of experienced engineers who helped us build our product and that's what we want to leverage for BetDEX as well.\" ",

            "content": "The cost of living has surged at its fastest pace in almost 10 years, hitting 4.2% in the year to October. It is mainly due to higher fuel and energy prices but the cost of second-hand cars and eating out also rose, the Office for National Statistics said. Inflation is up sharply since Covid restrictions ended this year and the economy reopened. The Bank of England says it may have to raise interest rates in the \"coming months\" to tackle rising prices. October's reading is far higher than the 3.1% rise recorded in the year to September and more than double the Bank's target of 2%. Inflation is the rate at which prices are rising - if the cost of a £1 jar of jam rises by 5p, then jam inflation is 5%. It applies to services too, like having your nails done or getting your car cleaned. You may not notice low levels of inflation from month to month, but in the long term, these price rises can have a big impact on how much you can buy with your money - sometimes referred to as the cost of living. Household energy bills were the biggest driver of inflation after Ofgem, the energy regulator, lifted the price cap on domestic gas and electricity last month. It meant that gas bills rose by 28.1% in the year to October, while electricity climbed by 18.8%. Petrol prices also rose by 25.4p to 138.6p per litre amid a surge in global oil prices. That's the highest price since September 2012. Used car prices also rose by 27.4% since April this year, due to a global microchip shortage which has slowed the production of new vehicles. Hotel stays, transport, clothing, household goods and raw materials also became more expensive. There are a number of reasons: Demand for oil and gas is pushing up energy prices worldwide. This means higher bills for householders and for businesses, many of whom will pass on some or all of the extra energy costs to their customers\nShortages of many goods, including building materials and computer chips, are causing supply problems and pushing up prices\nGovernment support to businesses during the pandemic - like reduced VAT for hospitality - has ended\nBusinesses are struggling to recruit lorry drivers and hospitality staff, and so are having to put up wages (costs that get passed on to consumers). This is partly due to the pandemic, but is also compounded by Brexit, according to international policy forum the OECD. Read more here Paula Sharp and Sarah Allan, nursery workers from Halifax in Yorkshire, have increased the hours they work because of their rising household costs. \"I'm getting more money in, but I'm paying it out on fuel, food, clothes,\" said Paula. Both women have seen a steep rise in their gas and electricity bills, and say they have to spend time shopping around to find the best deals on goods. \"We are tending to go for offers in the supermarket. The kids can't just put what they want in the trolley,\" says Sarah, who has 12 year-old twins. \"Everything has gone up. It might only be 50p or 60p here or there, but it does add up.\" Earlier this month, Bank of England governor Andrew Bailey apologised for the rising prices and warned inflation could climb as high as 5%, before falling back again.

Yes, many are facing similar problems as their economies reopen, such as surging energy prices and supply chain issues. US consumer prices rose by 6.2% in the year to October, the fastest rate for three decades. Inflation across the Eurozone was 4.1% in October, the highest since the 2008 financial crisis. And Canada's inflation rate hit the same level in September, marking an 18-year high. Most analysts now expect the Bank of England to increase interest rates from their current historic lows at its next meeting in December. A low interest rate means it is cheaper for people and businesses to borrow money, which they then spend or invest which in turn fuels economic growth. While growth is encouraged - especially following the various lockdowns - surging inflation could spell trouble for households. If the Bank of England lifts the interest rate, High Street banks may put up the borrowing costs they charge individuals and businesses. Higher interest rates mean people receive a better return on their savings, which should encourage them to save rather than spend. The theory is that if more people to save, this should slow the increase in prices of everyday goods by tempering demand. However, some analysts say a rate rise may not be effective in this case, because many of the factors driving UK inflation are global, such as higher oil prices. Read more For any member of a household paying an energy bill, it's obvious why the sharply rising prices are concerning. And of course, for poor households, especially pensioners, it will hit them hard financially. But at least from an environmental point of view, there may be an upside. Cheaper bills can carry hidden costs because they do too little to discourage us from wastefully emitting greenhouse gases. The effects of that may not be visible to us but they're not invisible if, for example, you live in a Pacific island nation. Where we don't need to burn energy and do so, for example, because we prefer the house to be at 21C rather than a perfectly habitable 16C, higher energy costs will make us think twice. That could do more to encourage us to invest in insulation, curb unnecessary emissions and to mindful of what we are doing to the planet than any resolution at last week's COP26 conference in Glasgow.

The harbour board and the energy giant are aiming to develop plans that could reduce emissions from vessels using the port. Potential projects include exploring using hydrogen as a clean marine fuel. Last month, the city council confirmed BP as its preferred bidder for a commercial partnership to help Aberdeen become a leading hydrogen hub. Under the new memorandum of understanding, the harbour and BP will also explore the potential for a pilot project to supply shore power. This would allow vessels to turn off their main engines while in port to reduce emissions and noise. North Sea firms looking beyond fossil fuels\nAberdeen hydrogen hub 'could create 700 jobs'\nDelayed harbour project to finish by October 2022 It comes as a £350m harbour expansion project continues. The work to make a new deeper and larger harbour is the largest marine infrastructure project in the UK. It will be able to provide space for cruise ships and renewable energy projects. Aberdeen Harbour Board chief executive Bob Sanguinetti said the collaboration with BP came at a \"significant time\". He said: \"Reducing emissions from vessels berthed in the port and providing low carbon power supplies will be critical to achieving a green maritime industry and requires innovative thinking and practices.\" BP North Sea senior vice president Emeka Emembolu said: \"For nearly 30 years, Aberdeen Harbour has provided BP with world-class facilities in support of our North Sea oil and gas operations.\" He added that BP was \"delighted\" to be strengthening the relationship. Fossil fuel industry has biggest delegation at COP26\nA really simple guide to climate change\nThe challenge of giving up North Sea oil Earlier this month, BP announced bumper profits after oil and gas prices soared amid a global economic bounce back. However, the long-term outlook for fossil fuel demand remains uncertain. Last week, a new global agreement to limit climate change - the Glasgow Climate Pact - was reached at the COP26 summit. BP has previously said it plans to sharply reduce its carbon emissions in the coming decades by increasing its renewable power capacity 20-fold by 2030, while reducing its oil output by 40% and diverting more funds to low-carbon investments. However, it is still investing billions in oil, focusing on oil fields where it can make higher profits. ",

            "content": "Japan's exports have snapped seven months of double-digit growth as the supply chain crisis hit the motor industry. Exports expanded by 9.4% in the year to October, the smallest rise in eight months and lower than forecasts. Shipments of cars were hit particularly hard, down by almost 37% from the same time in 2020. The slowdown highlights how vulnerable Japan's export-reliant economy is to supply chain bottlenecks. Car exports to Japan's two largest trading partners, China and the United States, dropped by almost half, according to data from the country's Ministry of Finance. At the same time imports rose by a slower-than-expected 26.7%, meaning that Japan's imports were 67.4 billion yen ($587m; £437m) higher than its exports. Supply chain problems have impacted economies around world this year as companies struggle to secure the goods they need to operate their businesses. Carmakers have been hit particularly hard by supply issues, especially the shortage of computer chips. In August, the world's biggest carmaker Toyota slashed its production forecast due to the shortage of semiconductors. But one expert believes the supply shortages faced by Japan's carmakers should have eased significantly by December. Tom Learmouth, Japan economist at Capital Economics, said the impact is likely to be temporary: \"Vietnam is the most important supplier of parts for Japanese carmakers in the region and had been hit with factory closures to control its Delta outbreak. \"We think that the rebound in exports will pick up pace over the coming months as production at Japanese carmakers returns to normal.\" Official figures also signalled reluctance by the country's manufacturers to invest in new equipment. Core machinery orders were flat in September compared to the previous month. Earlier this week, official figures showed that Japan's economy shrank faster than expected in the third quarter of the year, hit by global supply disruptions and a resurgence in Covid-19 cases. Gross domestic product contracted by 3%, compared to the same time last year. Japan's newly-elected prime minister Fumio Kishida is expected to announce the details of a new economic stimulus package reportedly worth \"several tens of trillion yen\" on Friday. ",

            "content": "Kapdaa is a British company which takes the textiles discarded by clothes makers and uses them to make other goods, such as wallets and notebooks. It was set up by Nish Parekh in 2015, when he had the idea re-using the offcuts from the clothes made by his mother, a fashion designer. His first product was a bookmark. Now, his core business is to make his offcut goods as gifts which are sold back to clothes designers and given to customers along with the garments they have bought. \"In the past three years, we have recycled over 10,000 metres of fabric which would otherwise have gone to landfill,\" says Nish. \"We work with over 300 fashion brands. It helps them gain environmental credibility. It's a tangible sign that they are committed to recycling.\" Nish and his team design their products at Kapdaa's studio in Kingston, London. The blueprints and offcut materials are then shipped to family-run workshops in Mumbai and Delhi to be manufactured. Up until 2018, Nish relied on only one workshop to turn out his orders. That was until he hit a supply crisis at Christmas time. \"We were doing really well with our Christmas orders,\" says Nish. \"They were gifts we were planning to hand out to clients. We sent all our work to our supplier. He wasn't expecting so [many] orders, but he still said he would do it. \"We had a delivery date of 2 December, I remember, and we were waiting - but the things weren't just getting done.\" The orders finally arrived by air freight from India on 18 December and Nish had to pick them up at dawn from a warehouse near Heathrow Airport to distribute immediately to clients. Nish says he remembers opening all the boxes on the streets of Hayes and repacking them to deliver them by hand on the same day. \"We delivered all the boxes and all the orders in time, but I would not do it again. It was too close to Christmas, and we were close to letting our clients down. We weren't giving them enough time to sell them or give them away.\" Shortly afterwards, Nish decided he could no longer rely on a single supplier to deliver all his firm's orders. \"In January the following year, we started looking for a new supplier. Over the next 10 months we gave them small orders each month so they were ready for the next Christmas rush. \"Now we've divided up 20% of our work with our back-up supplier, 80% with our current [main] supplier, so both of them are happy and they know what to expect.\" Nish's advice to entrepreneurs is to take on a second supplier and give them small amount of regular work so that they can step into the breach if ever there are problems with the main supplier. \"Always have a back-up supplier and train them,\" says Nish. \"Even if it costs a bit more, go ahead and do it because in the longer run, it will surely help you out.\" ",

It means that more than 20 suppliers have now ceased operations since August, affecting more than two million customers overall.

Ofgem said that customers of Neon and Social Energy Supply should take meter readings and wait for more information regarding their new supplier.

LV= said suitor Royal London had thrown a \"hand grenade\" to try to disrupt its planned £530m sale to US private equity firm Bain Capital, which would see LV= lose its mutual status. Royal London says it could keep LV= as a mutual. But LV= says Royal London wants to dismantle the business. At the moment, LV= is a mutual, which means it is owned by its 1.2 million member-customers. The proposed sale of LV= to Bain Capital has been controversial, drawing criticism from politicians from several parties. Some LV= members are also unhappy over the size of the possible payouts if the deal goes through. Its members are being asked to vote on the deal on 10 December. Boss of insurer LV= defends sale amid backlash LV= chief executive Mark Hartigan told the BBC that for the business to survive it needed to demutualise. The Royal London deal had been similar to the Bain offer, he said, but the latter offered better income and more security for members and staff. Mr Hartigan said Royal London had had nine months to make a better offer for LV=, but had not done so. Instead, Royal London had thrown a \"hand grenade\" in an interview with the BBC's Today programme on Tuesday, he said. This was \"disrespectful to the [LV=] membership\", Mr Hartigan said. Royal London boss Barry O'Dwyer told Today that the proposed Bain deal had met with \"near universal dismay\", and that \"there is a significant risk now that members won't support that proposal\". \"We think that hundreds of thousands of people invested their life savings with LV= partly because it was a mutual, and therefore we think that they should do everything possible to retain that status. \"If there is an option available to them to join forces with another mutual to preserve that heritage and to make sure that those customers continue to get what they bought, then they should explore that fully,\" he said. \"It's really difficult for LV= members and observers to believe that a US private equity company is going to safeguard member benefits and UK jobs more than a UK mutual does,\" he said. \"I just don't believe that that's credible.\" He added: \"My message to LV= is: Let's talk. There must be a better way.\" LV= attracted a number of bids when it first proposed a sale of the business, including from Royal London. On Tuesday, LV= said in a statement to members that it had received an updated email offer from Royal London last week that \"proposed the dismantling of LV=\" with \"significant headcount reductions\". \"To describe Royal London's proposal as offering 'a mutual alternative, more favourable to LV= members', is grossly misleading,\" LV= said. Alan Cook, chairman of LV=, said \"The board of LV= is clear that at no point have any of Royal London's proposals included an offer for membership rights or continuation of mutuality for LV= members, contrary to media speculation. \"Given this context, the board of LV= believes it is unfair and misleading to characterise any proposal from Royal London as preserving mutuality or offering a real mutual alternative.\" LV='s Mr Hartigan also hit back at reports that LV= bosses were acting in their own interests by selling the mutual to Bain, and that he was in line for a job at Bain after the deal goes through. He told the BBC \"the only job I have in front of me\" is getting the best deal for LV= members and staff, adding that he would be willing to lose his role if the LV= board thought that would be in the best interests of the business. \"I don't have a contract in hand\" from Bain, he added. \"I don't know what the future holds for me.\" He said the proposed Bain deal had been scrutinised by regulators and a judge in a legal process. The idea that \"somehow this is some plot because I want to get rich\" is \"ridiculous\", he added. Royal London said in a statement: \"Royal London has long wished to find a way to combine the UK's two biggest insurance mutuals, in order to deliver the best long-term value for our respective members. \"We do not want to break up LV= and would be delighted if the LV= board would engage in discussions. \"Our recent email to LV= recognised that they have signed a contract with Bain Capital which we believe would preclude them from having bilateral discussions with Royal London and so we proposed a three-way conversation between Royal London, LV and Bain Capital. \"Royal London can confirm that staying mutual is an option if LV makes this a priority and engages in talks with us.\" ",

            "content": "A town whose only supermarket burnt down during the first lockdown will soon have a temporary store which has been constructed in the car park. Budgens, described as a \"lifeline\" by customers in Holt, Norfolk, was gutted by fire in June. Owners CT Baker said the 5,000 sq ft store in Kerridge Way would open seven days a week from 23 November. It expects the store to stay put while a permanent replacement is built, subject to planning permission. Eight fire crews and 14 appliances were called to the fire at its height, with smoke visible from 10 miles away. No-one was in the building at the time and an investigation concluded the fire was caused by an electrical fault. Other stories you may be interested in from the Holt area: Christmas show that sells 100,000 seats cancelled\nLearning centre closes due to 'Covid funding gap'\nSir James Dyson gives £19m to old school Managing director Jane Gurney-Read said: \"The Budgens of Holt team are looking forward to welcoming back our customers who have shown us so much support in the months since we lost our supermarket in such terrible circumstances. \"It has, without question, been a challenging year, but we are determined to end it on a positive note and are looking forward to being at the heart of Holt's community once more.\" Holt's Post Office, which was within Budgens, will remain in Bakers & Larners department store while the temporary store operates. Bakers & Larners has a food hall and the town has independent food shops, but since the fire the nearest supermarket has been seven miles (11km) away in Sheringham.

            "header": "Five items that are going up in price and why",
            "content": "Official figures are expected to confirm what we all know, or have suspected, from experience in recent weeks - that the cost of living is now rising faster than it has for some time. Prices are going up at a relatively rapid rate on a variety of items and services. The governor of the Bank of England, Andrew Bailey, has even apologised for the situation. \"None of us want to see that happen,\" he says. The reasons behind those rising prices can be complicated. Here are five examples that help to explain why we are feeling the pinch: The cost of getting around is getting more expensive. The popular ride-hailing app recently increased its base fare in London by 10%. Travellers in the capital who want to get from the airport at peak times are now also facing a 15% surcharge. Uber says increased demand means it needs more drivers. By raising fares, the firm hopes to attract new drivers, and tempt back those who have gone to work for delivery firms instead. And of course, the queues outside petrol forecourts are still fresh in the memory for anyone trying to travel. Motorists with their own petrol or diesel car, can now fill up the tank without a wait, but prices remain high. Motoring group, the RAC says that unleaded petrol hit 146p a litre, and diesel reached 150p a litre in recent days. \"This means, filling up a 55-litre family car with unleaded has now topped £80 for the first time ever,\" says RAC fuel spokesman Simon Williams. The high cost of oil and the component parts of the fuel mean drivers will face an \"excruciatingly expensive winter\", he adds, especially for those on a low income who use their car to travel to work each day. If you want a compendium of issues that are causing price rises in general, then consider the example of do-it-yourself (DIY) and home improvements. The pandemic, global demand, shipping costs, plus a shortage of workers are all reasons why it is now more expensive to put up a garden fence. The cost of timber has doubled compared to a year ago, owing to all those reasons, so not only fences, but also interior walls, have become pricier. Covid pushed up the cost of raw materials, and shipping container prices from China saw a more than fourfold rise, says Rico Wojtulewicz, head of housing and planning policy at the National Federation of Builders. That contributed to a 25% rise in the price of materials for renovations. \"Not all materials are immediately available, so anyone having work done is likely to see prices rise again by the time works start. The cost of labour has also gone up by an average of 20%,\" he adds. \"If you are getting new windows, or doors, the plastic used has gone up by around 13%. Insulation [cost] has gone up by 20% and is going up again next year. Even paint is 10% more expensive than it was in 2020,\" he says. To be specific, we are talking the kind of processed snacks popular among all age groups - Pringles, Doritos, Hula Hoops, and so on. Prices for these snacks went up by 7.6% in the 12 weeks to the end of October, compared with the same period a year earlier, information from data firm, Kantar shows. Prices for canned colas, potato crisps and cat food also all went up by nearly 6%, or more, at the same time, the data show. Part of the reason is a hangover from the struggles caused by the pandemic. How have you adapted to rising prices? Are you shopping or living your life differently as a result? Email haveyoursay@bbc.co.uk\nWhatsApp: +44 7756 165803\nOr Upload your pictures/video here\nTweet: @BBC_HaveYourSay\nPlease read our terms & conditions and privacy policy Fraser McKevitt, head of retail and consumer insight at Kantar, explains that price were rising during the height of the pandemic because there was less discounting in supermarkets. In order to ensure there is stock on the shelves, retailers have used fewer promotions. That also means people are now far less loyal about where they shop. \"As prices increase in certain categories, we can expect shoppers to continue to visit several supermarkets and shop around to find the best deals,\" he says. \"Already, households visit an average of 3.3 supermarkets per month, in order to find the best value for money.\" The latest price rises are the result of added complexity as they include various issues on the chain of supply, and in getting products to the shelves. Why is the cost of living going up? Food prices in general are rising, but not at the same rate as some other products. However, the latest Kantar figures show they are still going up faster than at anytime since August 2020. Supermarkets operate in an extremely competitive environment, and analysts suggest they will be keen to keep prices down and retain their customers over the vital Christmas trading period. As the mercury dips, so the cost of heating our homes rises - and it is going to hit some people very hard in coming months. The rising cost of gas has been well documented in recent weeks. The cost to suppliers on the wholesale markets soared to unprecedented levels, for reasons which are complex and global. The effect on your domestic energy bill has been seen in three key ways: Firstly, a host of suppliers have gone bust. Their customers have been moved to another supplier, but on a more expensive tariff\nSecondly, many customers of remaining firms have been told that their monthly direct debit demand is going up\nThirdly, there is protection for customers on variable tariffs, through regulator Ofgem's price cap, but this limit was put up to a new high in October and is likely to rise by hundreds of pounds more in April Rising domestic energy bills are influential in the forecast for the inflation rate (measuring the rising cost of living as a whole), rising in the coming months, before being expected to drop as the situation eases. Scott Byrom, chief executive of price comparison website TheEnergyShop, says: \"The bubble has not burst yet.\" While a warm winter may help some suppliers offer better deals than they would otherwise have expected, everyone should still brace for significant further price rises, he says. That hit will be felt particularly hard among poorer people, as heating and eating take up a bigger proportion of household income. Motoring group, the AA, says that some cars are gaining in value as they sit on the driveway. Three to five-year-old Ford Fiestas, the most popular on its AA Cars website, are valued at £9,770 compared to £7,448 two years ago. The steepest increase was the price of a three-year-old Mini Hatch, which in 2021 was 57% higher (£15,367) than a model of the same age in 2019 (£9,811). The trend is so significant to cost of living data in general that it has been regularly highlighted by the official collector of the numbers - the Office for National Statistics. The main driver (pun intended) for second-hand car prices is pressure on manufacturing new vehicles. A global shortage of computer chips used in car production, as well as other materials such as copper, aluminium and cobalt, has led to fewer new vehicles rolling off production lines. That has meant more buyers turning to the used-car market. Rising demand means rising prices. ",

            "header": "Shell plans to move headquarters to the UK",
            "content": "Royal Dutch Shell has announced a plan to move its headquarters to the UK as part of proposals to simplify the company's structure. The oil giant will ask shareholders to vote on shifting its tax residence from the Netherlands to the UK. It also wants to do away with its dual share structure in favour of just one class of shares to boost \"the speed and flexibility\" of shareholder payouts. Shell's chief executive, Ben van Beurden, will relocate to the UK. The company's chief financial officer, Jessica Uhl, will also move, alongside seven other senior employees. Business and Energy Secretary Kwasi Kwarteng welcomed Shell's announcement, tweeting that it was \"a clear vote of confidence in the British economy\". The Dutch government, however, said it was \"unpleasantly surprised\" by Shell's proposal. According to reports in the Financial Times newspaper, Dutch government officials are scrambling to find a parliamentary majority to scrap a 15% withholding tax charged on dividends, which Shell has previously described as a problem. Stef Blok, economic affairs and climate minister, said earlier on Monday: \"We are in a dialogue with the management of Shell over the consequences of this plan for jobs, crucial investment decisions and sustainability.\" Royal Dutch Shell's structure is pretty complicated. The company is currently registered in the UK, but its headquarters are in the Netherlands. There are two different types of shares - effectively a Dutch share and a UK share - and this affects the way payments to shareholders are taxed. Now, under pressure from an activist investor, and facing huge change as the world moves away from fossil fuels, the company has decided it is time to simplify further. The move is designed to make payments to shareholders easier, while Shell says it will also help it to transform its business. But whether intended or not, this is also a deeply political move. If the proposals are adopted, Shell will no longer be \"Royal Dutch\" - and questions are being asked in The Hague about the extent to which the new company will be Dutch at all. The company said: \"Shell is proud of its Anglo-Dutch heritage and will continue to be a significant employer with a major presence in the Netherlands. \"Its projects and technology division, global upstream and integrated gas businesses and renewable energies hub remain located in The Hague.\" The decision to simplify Shell's structure comes after Third Point, a US activist investor, recently bought a stake in the company and suggested the business should be split into two firms, according to the Wall Street Journal. Third Point told Shell in a letter it should split itself into \"multiple standalone companies\", one of which would house its legacy oil and gas business while another would contain renewable energy. In an interview with the BBC earlier this month, Mr van Beurden dismissed Third Point's proposal. He said that while Shell could transition to net zero by 2050, the move to greener energy could only be funded by oil and gas. Earlier this year, a court in the Netherlands ruled that by 2030 Shell must cut its CO2 emissions by 45% compared to 2019 levels. The decision only applies in the Netherlands and Shell said it would appeal against the ruling. Shell has been incorporated in the UK and had a Dutch tax residence - as well as the dual share structure - since 2005. The changes also mean the company will drop \"Royal Dutch\" from its title and be renamed Shell. This element dates back to 1890 when the Royal Dutch Petroleum Company was formed. That company merged with the UK's Shell Transport and Trading Company in 1907. \"Carrying the Royal designation has been a source of immense pride and honour for Shell for more than 130 years,\" Shell said. \"However, the company anticipates it will no longer meet the conditions for using the designation following the proposed change.\" Shell said the simplified share structure means it would be able to \"accelerate\" shareholder distributions through, for example, share buybacks. The company announced a $2bn (£1.5bn) share buyback in July and will distribute an additional $7bn from the sale of its Permian Basin oilfield in the US. \"Aside from the fact that the shares they hold will no longer come with a 'Royal' designation, this new alignment won't change much for investors,\" said Laura Hoy, an equity analyst at Hargreaves Lansdown. \"The long-term growth story for Shell still rests heavily on the oil price. For now, buoyant oil prices are keeping the group's cash coffers topped up. However, with the inevitable shift to more sustainable energy picking up steam we suspect the need to invest in greener operations will keep a lid on what the group can pass on to shareholders.\" Shares in Shell rose by more than 2% on Monday. The company said its shares would continue to be listed in Amsterdam, London and New York. Shareholders will vote on the proposals at a meeting on 10 December. ",

Jason Mikula, a financial technology writer who also obtained the Apple records, wrote the states \"have ceded a shocking degree of control to Apple\". \"Beyond giving Apple near total control over the programme, states also agree to terms that make it nearly impossible to terminate the programme in the future,\" he said. According to two memoranda of understanding, \"the state agencies that have entered into them can only terminate them with Apple's consent or for cause - if Apple breaches the terms of the agreement and doesn't remedy within 30 days\".

Civil-liberties concerns also led to the scrapping of a 2019 attempt to introduce a more general digital-ID system in the UK. ",

            "header": "HS2 rail extension to Leeds set to be scrapped",
            "content": "The government is set to scrap the eastern leg of HS2 between the Midlands and Leeds, sources have told the BBC. The Transport Department will instead announce a new rail plan on Thursday, involving £96bn of funding for new routes in the North and Midlands. Sources said the impact of scrapping the Leeds leg of HS2 would make journeys longer by 20 minutes. But the government is set to argue the new plans will deliver comparable benefits more quickly and cheaply. A source told BBC political correspondent Nick Eardley they would show an \"enormous amount of common sense\". High Speed 2 is a planned new high-speed railway line, originally meant to connect London with the city centres of Birmingham, Manchester and Leeds. What is HS2 and where will it go? But Conservative MPs expressed concerns about the cost of the eastern leg connecting the West Midlands and Leeds, and there were rumours it would be scrapped. According to a report in the Sunday Times this weekend, Transport Secretary Grant Shapps will announce two shorter high-speed routes created in part by upgrading existing lines. One will run between Leeds and Sheffield, another from Birmingham to East Midlands Parkway. The government is also expected to put money aside to explore setting up a tram service for Leeds. The Northern Powerhouse Partnership, a group of northern local authorities and business leaders, said the decision to scrap the Leeds leg of HS2 was a mistake. Director Henri Murison said: \"The reported loss of any of the new line on the eastern leg of HS2 is damaging, reducing the benefits of the section being built now between Birmingham and London. \"Without the benefits to areas such as Yorkshire and the North East, HS2's status as a project to drive the whole of the UK is undermined considerably.\" A proposed Northern Powerhouse route from Leeds to Manchester is now expected to be made up of some new line, but it will mostly consist of upgrades to the existing track. The new track on the route will not allow high-speed rail travel. The route is not expected to go via Bradford, a key request of many in the city and surrounding area. Naz Shah, the Labour MP for Bradford West, tweeted: \"This is Boris pulling the whole damn rug from under our feet and ripping up the floor behind him!\" by Katy Austin, BBC transport correspondent The upcoming rail plan matters to many thousands of people and businesses. Whether they're taking a train for commuting, a business meeting or for leisure, what will their future options be? And how long will those journeys take? Rumours that the eastern leg of HS2 could be scaled back or scrapped altogether have been swirling for months. It now looks likely that only part of the route linking the West Midlands with Yorkshire will get a new high-speed track. The government's view is that the alternative option for HS2 would still make journey times faster, but deliver benefits more quickly. There's clearly a cost element too. But it doesn't bring the same benefits when it comes to capacity. Meanwhile, there's disappointment in cities such as Bradford. They see the delivery of Northern Powerhouse Rail, including a new line from Leeds to Manchester via Bradford, as crucial to regeneration and creating opportunities for their residents. We'll learn on Thursday what the final plans are. At the moment it looks like they will receive significantly more of a welcome in the East Midlands than the North of England. The shadow transport secretary, Jim McMahon, accused the government of trying to back out of promises made on badly-needed major infrastructure projects, and described the reported plans as \"half-baked and repackaged\". Conservative MP Kevin Hollinrake, who represents Thirsk and Malton in North Yorkshire, told the i newspaper the downsized plans indicated the government was \"not willing to put our money where our mouth is\". Of the £96bn set aside for the new Integrated Rail Plan, £40bn will be new money, the BBC understands. ",

            "content": "There will \"definitely\" be enough turkeys for Christmas, the British Poultry Council (BPC) has said. The pledge from the industry body came as the deadline closes to recruit thousands of temporary workers from the European Union to help process turkeys, amid widespread UK labour shortages. It believes about half of the visas made available have been taken up, but says this will be enough. \"It'll get us over the line,\" said the head of the BPC, Richard Griffiths. Although he predicted there would be \"a bird for everyone who wants one\", people would have less choice overall this year, he said. \"We've been able to streamline products and reduce the variety, so that helps with the overall volume. There will be a focus on whole birds and very simple crowns and roasts,\" he added. After months of pressure, the government relaxed immigration rules in September, making 5,500 visas available for foreign workers as a temporary measure to help the poultry industry get through Christmas. Farmers warn of Christmas turkey shortage\nAbattoir labour shortage sees farmer kill piglets\nChristmas turkey shortage likely, farmers warn The BPC reckons 2,500 to 3,000 applications have been made, although the Home Office and Defra would not comment, and those workers are now starting to arrive. These numbers are way below the 5,500 visas up for grabs - the number that the industry had estimated were needed at the start of the year. But Mr Griffiths says that thanks to a cut in the number of birds being reared, as well as producers managing to recruit some local EU seasonal workers who have settled status in the UK, the industry can now cope. For Paul Kelly, the owner of KellyBronze, a turkey producer in Essex, the government's temporary visa scheme has made all the difference. He now has the workers he needs. \"Christmas has been saved. I just wish they'd done it earlier,\" he says. This relatively small family business is now in its 50th year and prides itself on raising free range, hand plucked birds. \"It's impossible to do this job without seasonal workers. People say to me, you should employ local people,\" Mr Kelly said. \"Well, I have four weeks' work at Christmas. So how can I expect people to give up a full-time job to come for a month? \"We're a seasonal agriculture business, just like raspberries and strawberries, and we need people to help with our harvest.\" He managed to hire 63 mainly EU seasonal workers and needed another 22 through the government's emergency scheme. \"These 22 workers make up about 20% of my full team. It was touch and go and a lot of sleepless nights, up until the last week in September when we got the green light from the Government to get some visas\". Many shoppers have also been anxious. Consumers spent £6m more on frozen turkeys last month than a year earlier, according to data from Kantar. Households, it seems, have been racing to buy turkeys to stuff in the freezer, amid fears of festive shortages closer to Christmas. \"I don't think there will be people fighting over turkeys in the supermarket. The industry has pulled out all the stops and we will be supplying the Christmas market this year,\" said Mr Kelly. But he also agreed there would be less variety on offer. \"The visa scheme has helped, but it came too late for a lot of the Christmas catalogues which get done in May and June. \"All those lattice joints, stuffed joints, and all those fancy turkey joints - they've been shrunk right down. The range will be reduced, but the numbers will be there. \" His workers will be arriving over the next few days ready to start in earnest by the weekend, when the business will go at breakneck speed to fulfil some 26,000 orders. But Paul is already starting to think about next Christmas. He believes that without a permanent seasonal workers' scheme, the industry will shrink by another 15-20% next year. \"Without it, it's game over for the turkey industry,\" he said. \"If we can't supply the supermarkets, they might have to import turkeys from big producers in Poland and Germany, which is crazy.\" ",

            "header": "'I can't get equity release on my eco-friendly home'",
            "content": "\"I just don't understand their reasoning. I was just totally stunned.\" Andrew Bennett is describing the moment he learned that despite building a brand new, super energy efficient home, he wouldn't be able to borrow money against its value, a process known as equity release. The 73-year old and his wife had spent all their savings, £600,000, and three years building their eco-friendly home. But now their financial plans are in tatters as he can't access the capital invested in the house. No provider in the equity release market will lend against the property because it's been built using a construction method called Insulated Concrete Form (ICF). Along with solar panels and triple glazing, it makes Andrew's home very energy efficient. But because it's not a standard brick building with a tiled, sloping roof, equity release providers aren't interested. \"Well we'd like about a third of what the house cost to put half of that into premium bonds, so we've got a cash available. And to spend on a few frivolous things [for his bucket list].\" Andrew, who spent a 32-year career as a commercial airline pilot, says that bucket list includes things such as \"half an hour in a Spitfire, I'd like to buy a classic car and I've got three cars in bits I'd like to pay someone to fix before I pass away\". But all those plans are now in disarray. Under equity release, homeowners borrow money against their home's value\nThey don't repay anything until it's sold (by them or their estate if they die)\n90% of the equity release sector are members of industry body Equity Release Council\nIt has a set of rules and principles members must adhere to \"I'd seen lots of adverts in the papers and on TV advertising equity release so it seemed like a slam dunk,\" he says. \"But when I enquired, as soon as it got to the point of what the building was made of, ICF, it was a complete no-no. \"[The] house has been built according to building regulations, planning permission, it's been surveyed, it's all been approved but they just will not consider equity release on a house made of ICF. \"It's a lot more solid than any brick built property. It's prejudice that's unwarranted.\" Equity release is big business in the UK. In the three months to September alone a billion pounds was lent to more than 10,000 people. But Amanda Moore, a senior adviser at UK's largest equity release advice firm, Key, says Andrew's property is too much of a risk for providers. \"The reason why providers aren't accepting this offer is because it's too risky for them. Typically equity release is for the long term and it's an increasing debt rather than a reducing debt. \"So the risk is very different to conventional mortgage lending because construction type is classed as non-standard type. That's despite the Council of Mortgage Lenders nearly a decade ago classifying the ICF construction method as a standard type of construction. What does a future-proofed home look like? \"I wouldn't say Andrew is being punished by the [equity release] market, but he is possibly a victim of circumstance.\" But Amanda is keen to stress people thinking of building their own home shouldn't be put off an eco-friendly construction method because of what's happened in Andrew's case. \"The equity release market isn't looking to punish people who do the right thing, [Andrew] is a victim of being innovative and ahead of the game compared to more commonplace buildings the market is used to dealing with. \"Our advice isn't 'don't build an eco-friendly home', but instead [if you're hoping to secure equity release in the future] come to us first and we can tell people what will and won't work.\" You can hear more on BBC Radio 4's Money Box programme on Saturday at 12pm on Radio 4 or by listening again here shortly after broadcast.

            "header": "Delta boss says climate change means flying will cost more",
            "content": "The boss of the world's second biggest airline has said that tackling climate change will make flying more expensive. \"Over time, it's going to cost us all more, but it's the right approach that we must take,\" Delta Air Lines chief executive Ed Bastian told the BBC. Aviation is responsible for about 2.5% of the carbon emissions that are warming the planet, according to the International Energy Agency. Critics argue the best way to reduce them is by flying less. Atlanta-based Delta says that after spending $30m (£22.4m) a year on carbon-offsetting it has been carbon neutral since March 2020. It has also pledged to spend $1bn over the next decade to cancel out all the emissions it creates. More fuel-efficient planes, sustainable aviation fuels and removing carbon from the atmosphere are some of the ways it hopes to achieve this. Reducing carbon emissions is crucial if the world is to limit global warming to 1.5C above pre-industrial levels as agreed in Paris in 2015, and has been the focus of the COP26 climate change summit in Glasgow. Andreas Schafer, professor of energy and transport at University College London, says it will \"cost trillions rather than billions of dollars\" to move the global aviation sector to net zero carbon emissions. What is the Paris climate agreement?\nSeven ways to curb climate change\nHow adjusting flight plans can help the climate Preliminary results from his team's research suggest airfares would need to increase by 10%-20% to cover the costs. \"In the short-term, government support will be needed with those costs as decarbonising aviation will be extremely challenging, and current efforts will need to be scaled up dramatically\", says Prof Schafer. Mr Bastian concedes it is an ambitious goal that his airline won't be able to achieve alone. \"It's the biggest long-term challenge this industry faces,\" he said. \"We're in an industry that's classified as hard to decarbonise because we don't have the bio-fuels or the sustainable aviation fuels (SAFs) en masse yet that we're going to need.\" Jet fuel from thin air: Aviation's hope or hype?\nClimate change: Jet fuel from waste 'dramatically lowers' emissions Delta aims to be using 10% sustainable aviation fuel by the end of 2030. Many airlines and fuel companies are investing in SAFs. Other technologies being developed involve turning food waste into jet fuel and using carbon dioxide pulled out of the air. However, these still cost more than traditional jet fuels and the quantities needed are also seen as problematic. According to the US government, global demand for jet fuel is set to more than double by 2050 . The number of passenger flights is set to jump from a pre-pandemic 4.5 billion to 10 billion by 2050, according to the International Air Transport Association (IATA). IATA director general Willie Walsh told the BBC that while creating the levels of SAF production needed was a big challenge, \"it is perfectly possible if industry and governments work together\". \"Production increases will bring the cost down to competitive levels. We've seen similar increases in the development of solar and wind power in recent decades.\" At the UN climate change summit in Glasgow, 23 countries have pledged to work together to get the aviation industry to net zero carbon emissions by 2050. More efficient energy use, sustainable aviation fuels and electric aeroplanes are all part of their ambitions. However, environmental campaign group Greenpeace says the agreement is \"brazen greenwashing\". \"This announcement is full of scams like offsetting, and excessive optimism on so-called 'sustainable aviation fuels' and future aircraft designs,\" says Greenpeace's Klara Maria Schenk. \"But it lacks the one thing that's needed to deliver the goal of limiting temperature rise to 1.5C which is tangible action to prioritise green travel and reduce flights.\" Whilst many businesses and individuals have used the pandemic as a chance to re-evaluate their carbon footprints, Mr Bastian thinks the number of flights will return to pre-pandemic levels. \"All forms of travel are on the way back. Families are the part of the travelling public that we're most happy to see, because there's been some really difficult stories over time of families not being able to connect for long [periods]\". Coronavirus: Boeing says air travel to recover by 2024\nAirline industry 'needs $80bn more government aid'\nPandemic fills up Australian airline storage Business travel is also returning because video meetings can't replace everything, says Mr Bastian. \"There's a real unity and sense of purpose that we have when people get back together in person\". That desire to travel helped Delta to report a $194m profit in the three months to the end of September, its first profit since the pandemic began. Before the pandemic Delta was the world's second biggest airline, flying 200 million passengers in 2019. As of September it was operating at 71% of its pre-pandemic capacity. The recovery in its domestic US market has been fastest, with long-haul routes to Asia the slowest. That echoes the pattern seen in a recent forecast from planemaker Boeing, which forecast a full recovery of global aviation would take until 2024. Like other airlines, Delta has received billions in government support to get through the pandemic, but is hopeful of a brighter future now the US has reopened its borders to international travellers. Mr Bastian says this may take some adjusting to and there may be long queues at airports as Covid vaccines and paperwork are checked. However, he is confident in the airline's outlook and says the pandemic was \"an opportunity to invest in our future\". Now the airline is making money again he says: \"We hope to be able to maintain that and go into the new year as a profitable carrier.\" You can watch Ed Bastian's full interview on \"Talking Business with Aaron Heslehurst\" this weekend on BBC World News at Saturday 23:30 GMT, Sunday 05:30 and 16:30 GMT and Monday at 08:30 GMT ",

            "content": "A woman who gave up sport because of a lack of sanitary products is sponsoring a girls' football team with the period pants company she founded. Growing up in Nepal, Ruby Raut, of St Albans, Hertfordshire, had to make-do with scraps of fabric, which would fall out of her underwear as she played. In 2017, she founded WUKA period pants, which include padding for protection. She said she was \"proud\" but had \"mixed emotions\" about supporting Hertfordshire County under-16s. \"I would've loved to have had something like this when I was growing up - and a lot of parents tell me the same,\" said Ms Raut. \"[Periods] are normal and every girl has them, but there is an embarrassment, especially among young people.\" She said she hoped the team could give her feedback on its products, which she was giving them at their home ground in Watford. While the players' white shorts may make the Herts players self-conscious each month, Ms Raut said the culture in Nepal surrounding periods had restricted her life from the age of 12. \"Girls in Nepal would be sent to the cowshed or menstrual hut to have their periods, and when I had mine I was sent to my aunt's,\" she said. \"We would be given our own cups and plates which were passed to us across the floor. \"We were not allowed to touch another human being, or touch plants, or go out to see the sun.\" Towels and tampons were not available and loose-fitting underwear, which was the norm, meant fabric off-cuts would fall out. \"This happened many times, myself included, and it created that shame and embarrassment around periods, and you slowly start giving up on sports,\" said Ms Raut. She said it stayed with her, and she used the concept of pinning fabric into underwear to create WUKA in 2017. \"I took that idea, bought a second-hand sewing machine and pressed fabric into a pair pants and built it up - they were really comfortable. \"You can take them off, wash them, and I thought 'you could give these to an 11-year-old and you wouldn't have to show them how to use menstrual products'. \"I am really proud that the next generation - my kids and grandchildren - will grow up using something that doesn't cost the earth,\" she said.

            "content": "Lockdown was an isolating experience for many people, but for John Emery it was an amazing opportunity to make new friends nearby and overseas. The maintenance engineer has always had an interest in amateur radio, but pandemic restrictions actually gave him the chance to fully embrace his hobby. He was able to save enough money to afford the equipment needed. With radio exams forced to move online, he also had the time to get fully qualified. He says he has since joined a radio club and regularly speaks to other amateur radio enthusiasts across Europe. \"I have made new friends,\" the 55-year-old from Derbyshire says. \"This helped with living alone and there are hundreds of people who have done the same.\" However, not everyone feels so positive about their pandemic purchases. A survey by insurer Aviva, reported on BBC News, suggested that one in 10 people had suffered buyers' remorse over things they bought during lockdowns. Gaming equipment, DIY tools, home gyms, bikes, clothing and jewellery, musical instruments, kitchen appliances such as bread makers, garden furniture, pizza ovens and hot tubs all appeared on the regret list, the insurer says. Hot tub accidents triple in lockdown, says insurer\nGet off your Pelotons and back to work - top Tory Typically, shoppers admitted spending nearly £1,400 on the items which have subsequently gathered dust or been sold on. On the flip side, if one in 10 people think their purchases were a mistake, that means as many as nine in 10 could be more than happy with what they bought. When we asked for your stories, there were plenty of people who replied to the BBC saying they were delighted with their new belongings. Among those who got in touch was Anna Tune, who picked up two contrasting hobbies at home - crocheting and body pump. As a nurse for the NHS, Mrs Tune has a stressful job but says she was getting a little bored at home during lockdown. The 50-year-old, who lives in Kent, says the light weight training equipment, which she uses during online classes, was \"worth every penny\" and helped keep up her exercise routine while stuck at home. Her husband, Bob, was so impressed he took it up too. And the crocheting? A new hobby inspired by a friend - it was something Mrs Tune had never tried following failed attempts to pick it up at school. \"I thought the talent had skipped a generation, but it relieved the boredom and I find it very relaxing. I can't stop doing it now,\" she says. The results have included blankets made for a birthday and for friends' newborn children. Tom Oakley says his lockdown purchase was a great help for body and mind. The dad, aged in his 40s, bought a static bike and ended up making new friends near his Cambridge home. He was keen to exercise during lockdown, but walking was not enough, and an old injury ruled out running. He admits that his other passion - inline-skating - has its limitations. \"You can only do it when the ground is bone dry, and there are not many other middle aged men who skate to make it social,\" he says. So, he chose the bike and signed-up to an online cycling game, discovering that some other dads in the area were signed-up too. \"In the depths of winter, we started cycling on our indoor bikes and joined group rides together. I started to get to know their personalities. When lockdown was eased, I joined one of their Sunday group rides and they have welcomed me ever since,\" he says. \"My wife thinks it is a great, If I am cycling indoors, it is the most time-efficient exercise I can get, so I can spend more time with our children and helping around the house,\" he says. \"Or, if I go outside for a group ride, she knows I'm being healthy - in body and mind - and making friends with other dads. \"She has been on the indoor bike a few times too!\" We asked you to tell us whether your lockdown purchases had become expensive mistakes. Here is a selection of some of your regrets (spoiler: some are more serious than others). Duncan, 48, in Godalming, says: \"My family has regretted the bagpipes that I bought as a new lockdown hobby.\"\nNeil, 47, from Leeds, says: \"I bought a cello for my wife after caving-in to pleas that it would be perfect to relearn the instrument, after playing in her youth. Level One cello passed and now decorating the corner of the dining room.\"\nLee, 32, in Southampton, says: \"Buying building materials and starting an extension and kitchen renovation, to then run out of money, not be able to finish it and have the bank reject borrowing any more. Should of just saved the money and waited.\"\nMichael in London says he bought a gym for his garage as the local council facility had closed owing to Covid. He then lost his job owing to the pandemic and has been left with a \"crippling\" loan to repay.\nGary Beaven, 55, from Nottingham says: \"The garden furniture is still in the box.\"\nSarah Homer, 37, from Dorset, says she wished she had done more research before buying a carpet cleaner. \"It is pretty useless, and takes up a whole cupboard,\" she says. \nGlynn Hurrell, 26, from Lincoln, says: \"I bought an exercise bike that I have only done four miles on. It sits there every day, in the corner of my lounge, teasing me.\"\nMike, 28, from London, says: \"Unfortunately a monthly beer subscription, which definitely has not done me well in the long run!\"\nRobyn Blair, 24, from Harrow says: \"I bought a 12 foot trampoline.\" One serious concern is that, for some people, lockdown purchases proved to be bad for their mental and financial health, and risked causing them anxiety in the future. Helen Undy, chief executive of the Money and Mental Health Policy Institute, says: \"When you're feeling isolated or distressed, and spending more time online - as so many of us were during lockdown - it is much harder to resist the urge to buy things we don't need or can't afford. \"That's made even harder by the way retailers bombard people with pushy personalised ads online, the easy access to 'buy now pay later' credit and the option to buy things with one click. Lots of people also say they get lumbered with unwanted purchases because the process of returning them felt too stressful and difficult.\" She says retailers can help people stay in control of their spending by giving them more autonomy over the ads they see, and the choice to opt out of 'buy-now-pay-later' credit. \"We'd also like to see retailers make it as easy to return goods as it is to buy them,\" she adds.

The chancellor said he doubted his banking career would have been successful if he had started it in virtual meetings, and that being in the office helped build skills. Ms Mann, a member of the BoE's Monetary Policy Committee that sets interest rates, said online communication was unable to replicate the spontaneous office conversations that were important for recognition and advancement in many workplaces. She told an event hosted by Financial News magazine: \"Virtual platforms are way better than they were even five years ago. But the extemporaneous, spontaneity - those are hard to replicate in a virtual setting.\" Sunak warns young home working may hurt career\nWorkers who want flexible work roles missing out Difficulty accessing childcare and pandemic-related disruption to schooling meant many women were continuing to work from home, while it had been easier for men to return to the office. \"There is the potential for two tracks,\" she said. \"There's the people who are on the virtual track and people who are on a physical track. And I do worry that we will see those two tracks develop, and we will pretty much know who's going to be on which track, unfortunately,\" she said. Ms Mann was an economics professor and chief economist at investment bank Citi and the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development, before joining the BoE in September. Businesswoman Justine Roberts, co-founder of the Mumsnet website, agreed that there was a risk women's careers could suffer from not being in the office. But it was up to companies to be aware of this. But the flipside, she told the BBC, was that the flexibility of home working was a huge benefit to women, and mothers in particular. Presenteeism and long-hours culture had been eroded by new ways of working. \"Let's not forget that one of the best things to come out of [the pandemic crisis] is the ability to work flexibly,\" especially for mothers juggling childcare and school runs, she said. According to a BBC survey, just over half (56%) of women said they thought working from home would help them progress at work, as childcare and caring duties become less of a hindrance to working full-time. In all, 65% of managers felt that working from home helps advance women's careers. However, a quarter of the women polled said homeworking was unlikely to advance their careers. Danielle Harmer, chief people officer at insurance giant Aviva, said companies need to set out a framework to ensure that people working remotely are not an afterthought for company bosses. Otherwise, she said, career prospects and the gender pay gap would suffer. \"I think if organisations leave it up to their employees, you could have a potential situation where those with caring responsibilities, who tend to be female, tend to work from home more often, and we look back in two years and think: hang on a second, why has the gender pay gap widened? Or why are female promotions slowing down a little?\" she said. \"It's taken us a long time to make progress on things like the gender pay gap, and I think it would be terrible if we went backwards on it.\" The Office for National Statistics (ONS) said British businesses reported that on average 60% of their staff were fully back at their normal place of work. About one-in-six employees are estimated to be using a hybrid model of working, the ONS said. Vincent Keavney, Partner at the law firm DLA Piper and Lord Mayor of London told the BBC's Today programme that he thought it was \"important\" for younger members in the sector to be in the office in order get the training they need. \"The buzz around the office and the buzz around the city is fantastic.\" \"I don't think we should be micromanaging companies but there is a very strong message the the city is open,\" he added. However, proportions vary widely by sector. In professional services, 34% of staff are in the office, 24% are fully working from home, and 35% are doing a mix, the ONS said. Separate ONS data showed a slightly higher percentage of male workers than females worked from home for at least some of the time in late October. Previous ONS analysis showed women were more likely than men to say working from home allowed them more time to work, with fewer distractions. But men said working from home helped them come up with new ideas, while women found it a hindrance. ",

            "content": "Manufacturing at a once-threatened Rolls-Royce plant will continue for at least 10 years, the engineering giant has announced. The site in Barnoldswick, Lancashire, had seen strikes in a long dispute over the firm's future plans for it. A spokesman said a deal had been struck with unions \"to ensure Barnoldswick can move forward with certainty\". It was \"a tremendous achievement\" for workers who \"stood solidly in support of one another\", the union Unite said. The deal extends protections secured in 2020, including a commitment that there will be no compulsory redundancies for five years, the union added. In August 2020, Rolls-Royce announced proposals to merge its plants in the town and cut about 350 jobs. Workers went on strike in the following November, after it was revealed aeroplane fan blade production would move to Singapore. In January, it was announced Barnoldswick would be a core site with a new centre of excellence to train workers, but concerns were later raised over suggestions the number of roles at the plant could drop below 350. A spokesman for the firm said at the time that it was trying to secure new work and would make no compulsory redundancies. In a new statement, the firm said the aviation industry had faced \"an unprecedented impact from the Covid-19 pandemic and we have had to restructure to address the resulting drop in workload\", adding that \"both the company and the trade union have had to work hard to reach this agreement\". \"We now look forward to working with Unite to ensure Barnoldswick can move forward with certainty,\" it said. Unite's assistant general secretary Steve Turner said the deal was \"a tremendous achievement for the workers... who have stood solidly in support of one another and their community\". \"This dispute should act as an inspiration to all facing similar challenges as we transition to a greener economy,\" he added.

            "content": "The construction industry is warning of shortages of skilled workers due to Brexit and rising demand. Milton Keynes College runs training courses which aim to tackle that, but will it be the solution to the problem and how will the next generation of builders be encouraged to enter the industry? Megan is a bricklaying technician and training to become a teacher on construction courses at Milton Keynes Collage. \"I was doing health and social care but it wasn't for me at all. I really didn't think that was my career path,\" she says. \"Some of the people I knew were doing bricklaying at the time, I said 'OK, that looks pretty cool - I would love to do it'. \"I told my father I was going to do bricklaying and his first reaction was 'are you sure?'.\" She says after six months on the course she knew she loved it and went on to complete the two-year course. Megan, who did not want to give her surname, says young people, especially women, should consider the construction industry because \"you've always got opportunities\". She says: \"I think women have this mindset that on a construction site it is very male dominated, and it is, but you can do the same as a man. \"If you are a make-up artist you can lay a brick. I still get my nails done, I still wear my make-up, but I lay bricks for a living. \"Some of my friends ask 'why do you do it?'. \"It's because I love it.\" Jordan Maxey is the course team leader for apprenticeships at the college. \"I turn around to my students and say you are no longer classmates - you are colleagues,\" he says. \"It gives them this idea that they are now in the industry. It's straight from school into 'this is what my future life will look like'.\" Mr Maxey, a professional bricklayer as well as a teacher, believes it is about showing students how the industry works, alongside teaching them the skills. He says: \"The way I want to teach it, I tell them how to do it, I demonstrate it, we do it together, then I leave them and I say 'you are going to redo it yourself'. \"It's the same way you would do it in the industry, there's not a divide as a teacher and student, it's more like 'it's a team now'.\" Milton Keynes College has partnered with a building firm Careys to set up a new groundworker apprenticeship. The college will take over the ground floor of the company's local office for classrooms and use their yard for the practical work. Maddy Donaghy from Careys says: \"The idea is we will begin to feed a talent pipeline into the region where it is needed. \"There is a huge shortage of new entrants into the industry. This skills shortage isn't new, but it is rising.\" 'The shortage of materials is the worst it's been'\n'I wanted to be a show jumper, now I drive lorries'\n'This timber bubble shows no signs of bursting' She believes the construction industry has not \"been great at going in and enticing new entrants into the industry or even showcasing the careers that are available\". But Ms Doughy hopes new apprenticeships and work placements \"can show how progressive the industry can be\". She says: \"These entrants aren't going to the solve the problem straight away, but within two to five years we will see a flow of new entrants into the industry.\" Apprentices will also get practical experience on Careys' building sites, such as Milton Keynes University Hospital where it is carrying out groundworks. Christopher Mack, the project manager, says: \"The apprentices have really helped us with this project. \"They come in and we try and teach them the skills they need and they've helped install the drainage and the pipework.\" Some in the construction industry say there have been problems since Brexit. Richard Harpin, chief executive of Homeserve, whose company also operates Checkatrade, has said skills shortages are being caused by \"mainly EU migrant workers going home\". In response, the government said its \"plan for jobs\" was helping people \"retrain, build new skills and get back into work\" and firms should invest in the domestic workforce rather than rely on labour from abroad. Mr Mack says he hopes the apprentices in Milton Keynes will help fill the shortage of building workers. He says: \"Since I've been working the construction industry I've seen less and less people coming through. \"Now we are seeing the next generation. Previously a lot of roles were filled by people from the EU, but that is being replaced by homegrown talent. \"Going forward we need to plug that hole and apprenticeships are the best way to do that.\" Find BBC News: East of England on Facebook, Instagram and Twitter.

            "header": "Japanese giant Toshiba announces breakup plan",
            "content": "Japanese conglomerate Toshiba has confirmed plans to split the company into three separate businesses. Toshiba said the three companies would be focused on infrastructure, semiconductors and devices. The company has come under increasing pressure from activist investors to make changes since an accounting scandal in 2015. This week, US giant General Electric announced a similar strategy that will see the historic company broken up. Toshiba's plan will see it spin off two core businesses - its energy and infrastructure unit as well as its device and storage operation. After shedding those two companies, Toshiba will continue to own a 40.6% stake in memory chipmaker Kioxia as well as other assets. It expects to complete the reorganisation by the second half of 2023. The move is aimed to increase the stock market valuations of Toshiba's different businesses after facing pressure from shareholders. But some analysts are concerned about the timescale for the changes. \"The move is in the right direction, but it seems slow,\" said Atul Goyal of investment bank Jefferies, who would have preferred a timeline of three-to-six months. \"2023 is a long way out and we are not sure what else will change between now and then.\" Toshiba is one of Japan's oldest and largest firms, with divisions that range from home electronics to nuclear power stations. However, the company has faced wrenching changes in recent years as it dealt with the fallout of an accounting scandal and huge losses linked to its US nuclear unit. In 2015, then-chief executive and president Hisao Tanaka resigned after Toshiba said it had overstated its profits by more than a $1bn. In April of this year, UK private equity group CVC Capital Partners made an unsolicited $20bn takeover bid for Toshiba. A week later, the company's chief executive Nobuaki Kurumatani resigned amid controversy over the bid. Toshiba then rejected CVC's offer, which angered some activist shareholders. In June, a shareholder revolt saw chairman Osamu Nagayama ousted from his position. On Tuesday, US conglomerate General Electric announced that it would split into three separate companies. The company said it will spin off its healthcare business in early 2023 and combine its renewable energy, fossil-fuel power and digital units into one company that will be spun off the following year. The remaining business will be its jet engine maker GE Aviation. The move marks the breakup of an iconic manufacturer which was founded by Thomas Edison. It went on to become a sprawling business empire that was once the world's most valuable company. Toshiba dates back to the 1870s and for decades after World War Two it was a symbol of Japan's economic recovery and its high tech industry. From the electronics goods found in so many of our homes to nuclear and coal power stations - the company has loomed large in Japan. But in 2015 it admitted that it had overstated its profits for six years, making it a symbol of the many scandals blighting Japan Inc. To avoid bankruptcy, it sold its crown-jewel memory chip business in 2018. Today's announcement that it will split into three companies marks the end of an era, but it also highlights the growing impact of activist investors who successfully ousted the board's chairperson in June. Splitting up conglomerates is a far from common business strategy in Japan so it remains to be seen whether it will be successful, and more crucially if it is enough to please activist investors. ",

            "content": "Chinese e-commerce giant Alibaba's Singles Day is known for being the world's biggest online shopping extravaganza. But this year it has been a more toned down affair as Beijing cracks down on businesses and economic growth slows. Sales for the 11-day event rose at their slowest rate since it was launched in 2009, up 8.5% on last year. However, customer spending still hit a fresh record high of 540.3bn yuan ($84.5bn; £63.2bn). This year marks the first time that sales for Alibaba's Singles Day, which the company refers to as the \"11.11 Global Shopping Festival\", failed to achieve double digit year-on-year growth. \"It's probably not that great if you consider the market is expected to grow at almost 12%,\" Rui Ma from the Tech Buzz China website told the BBC. \"They've already tapped out this holiday to its extreme. This is already a big number so its hard to show growth,\" she added. It comes against the backdrop of the Chinese government's rapid moves in recent months to impose tough new rules on the country's internet giants. After years of limited oversight by Beijing, officials have been enforcing regulations to ensure that the technology industry competes fairly and contributes more to society. Alibaba found itself in the spotlight during the crackdown as it paid a record $2.8bn fine after a probe determined it had abused its market position for years. The company also said it would change the way it conducted its business. Shen Lu from technology website Protocol told the BBC that this year's Singles Day was about improving the company's image: \"Alibaba is trying to present themselves to be a tech company with social responsibility.\" \"They're showing they're complying with regulations and fitting into the general political atmosphere,\" she said. This approach brought a more socially conscious emphasis to the event than previous years with eco-friendly products and campaigns to raise money for good causes. For example, viewers of a three-hour livestream were encouraged to click \"like\" and help raise money for an elephant reserve in China's rural southwest. Ms Shen also suggested that there are signs that shoppers are looking for new ways to buy online: \"It's now been 12 years since Alibaba invented the Singles Day shopping event.\" \"It was such a hype years ago but it's no longer exciting for shoppers in China,\" she said. One of those new approaches is live-streaming shopping, which consultancy McKinsey has predicted is the future of online sales in China. Last month, two of China's most famous celebrity online sellers reportedly raked in $3bn in just 12 hours. Slowing growth Consumers may also be wary of making unnecessary purchases as China's economic recovery shows signs of losing steam. According to official figures, the world's second largest economy grew by 4.9% in the July to September quarter from a year earlier. That was the slowest pace of expansion in a year and worse than analysts had predicted. It comes as power shortages, new outbreaks of Covid-19 and concerns about the country's property market weigh on the economy. ",

            "content": "Prisons are facing difficulties recruiting enough officers amid a surge in job vacancies, a union has said. This comes as job adverts have soared to a record high in the run-up to Christmas, according to recruiters. Driving instructors, prison officers and forklift truck drivers are among the jobs in highest demand, the Recruitment and Employment Confederation (REC) said. Meanwhile demand for construction roles dropped due to supply chain problems. How do I find a new job and who is hiring?\nUK job vacancies reach 20-year high\nForeign drivers to be allowed more UK deliveries Prisons were among the employers with the most demand for staff in late October and early November, REC data suggested, with adverts for prison officer rising by 13%. The Prison Officers Association (POA) union said prisons are facing severe recruitment difficulties. \"Staff are voting with their feet and leaving\" after a recent pay review, said POA assistant general secretary Mick Pimblett. The prison service is \"close to breaking point\" in the run-up to Christmas, he added. The POA gave Berwyn prison in north Wales as an example - 134 prison officers have left over the past three months. There has been an increase in violence and self-harm among prisoners, and violence directed at prison officers, after coronavirus restrictions on prisoners mixing were lifted, said Mr Pimblett. Due to crown courts processing cases again after postponements from coronavirus lockdowns and people being convicted, the number of prisoners is reaching capacity, putting more strain on the system, he added. A HM Prison Service spokeswoman said: \"Vacancies across the estate have been stable for six months and these figures include recruitment to our brand new prison, HMP Five Wells, which will open in the new year.\" In October, the HM Prison Service announced that all staff earning less than £24,000 will receive a £250 pay rise, and all staff yet to reach the top of their pay band will continue to receive progression pay of up to 5%. Vacancies for driving instructors saw the biggest jump, the REC data suggested, rising by about a third. An REC spokesman said that pent-up demand from the pandemic for driving lessons and tests was likely to be behind the rise. Karen Bransgrove, general manager of the Driving Instructors Association (DIA), said she had not noticed more adverts, but there was a lot of demand for tests and lessons. \"There is a huge backlog of tests,\" she said, adding that people could not learn to drive for 18 months during the pandemic so \"naturally there's pent-up demand\". She added that the number of instructors had also fallen. \"Lots of people took early retirement or dropped out [of driving instruction] due to the pandemic,\" Ms Bransgrove said. Loveday Ryder, chief executive of the Driver Vehicle and Standards Agency (DVSA) said it was doing \"all we can\" to provide as many tests as possible services get back to normal. \"I know learners will be keen to take their test now, but it is important that candidates are properly prepared and don't rush to take it,\" she said. \"With more than half of candidates failing, and demand currently extremely high for tests, learners should only take their test only when they are confident they can pass.\" This would prevent a further backlog of tests and lengthy waits for retests. The REC figures also suggested a sharp rise in vacancies for forklift truck drivers. There is a chronic shortage of HGV drivers in the UK, which the logistics industry has blamed on factors including Covid and Brexit. There is also a shortage of forklift truck drivers, which the UK Warehousing Association said was also linked to Brexit. Clare Bottle, the association's chief executive, said that prior to Brexit, 34% of forklift truck drivers were EU nationals, but now many had gone back to their home countries. Driver pay went up between 20-30% because of the labour shortages that followed, she said, which was unsustainable for warehousing businesses, the majority of which were small to medium-sized. These businesses were already operating on thin margins, with 60-70% of costs already taken up by staffing. In the short term, those businesses had put prices up for their retailer customers to survive, but Ms Bottle said those price rises could ultimately be passed onto consumers, adding to inflationary pressures. How serious is the shortage of lorry drivers?\nLorry driver shortage: Government to lift rules on foreign haulier deliveries In the longer term, the industry needed to attract more younger people and women, she said. Ms Bottle added that warehousing was \"dominated\" by older people, mainly men: \"We've got an image problem that we need to tackle.\" A government spokesperson said: \"We are closely monitoring labour supply and working with sector leaders to understand how we can best ease particular pinch points. Similar challenges are being faced by other countries around the world. \"We want to see employers make long term investments in the UK domestic workforce instead of relying on labour from abroad. Our Plan for Jobs is helping people across the country retrain, build new skills and get back into work. \"The government encourages all sectors to make employment more attractive to UK domestic workers through offering training, careers options, wage increases and investment.\" Job adverts surged in many parts of the country between 25 October and 7 November, the REC data suggested, but in some sectors there was a sharp fall in demand. During the pandemic the UK construction industry has boomed, driven by factors including more house sales during the stamp duty holiday and an increased appetite for home improvements. But Covid has also seen a global squeeze on supply chains, with the costs of building materials rising rapidly. The REC's chief executive Neil Carberry said adverts for construction jobs saw a drop-off last week as supply issues \"constrained the industry's ability to work to capacity\". Adverts for painters and decorators were down more than 17%, while demand for roofers, plasterers, bricklayers and carpenters also fell. The Federation of Master Builders said the drop in adverts \"may be indicative of the overall cooling off of the market, following a 24-year-high in construction activity earlier in the year as lockdown restrictions eased\". Brian Berry, chief executive of the Federation of Master Builders, said: \"Small, local builders are also facing lengthy delays, with 89% having to press pause on work because of skills and materials shortages. \"These [REC] figures could suggest that builders are unwilling or unable to take on more work while skills and materials are running short, causing uncertainty when planning for new jobs.\" ",

            "content": "UK economic growth slowed between July and September as supply chain problems hindered the recovery, latest official figures show. The Office for National Statistics said consumer spending increased as Britain continued to emerge from lockdown. But that was offset by falls in other areas of the economy, leaving growth for the three months at 1.3%. It means the economy is 2.1% smaller than in the final three months of 2019, before the coronavirus pandemic hit. Sterling fell to its lowest level of 2021 against the dollar on Thursday following the news. Grant Fitzner, ONS chief economist, said service growth expanded, helped by house buyers rushing to do deals before the end of the stamp duty holiday. \"However, these were partially offset by falls in both the manufacture and sale of cars. \"Notably, business investment remained well down on pre-pandemic levels in the three months to September,\" he said. Growth slowed significantly from a 5.5% rise recorded between April and June when many Covid restrictions were lifted. The ONS said that the UK expanded by less than it initially thought in July and August, leading them to revise down growth figures for both months. \"What happened earlier in July and August was that we had the pingdemic.\" said Sarah Hewin, head of research for Europe and the Americas at Standard Chartered. \"And that ended up essentially holding the economy flat.\" In contrast, the economy grew by 0.6% during September. Chancellor Rishi Sunak said the latest figures showed his economic policies were working. What is GDP and how does it affect me? \"The economy continues to recover from Covid and thanks to schemes like furlough, the unemployment rate has fallen for eight months in a row and we're forecast to have the fastest growth in the G7 this year,\" he said. Kirsty Davies-Chinnok, from Professional Polishing Services (PPS), told the BBC that the company, which polishes metals such as stainless steel and aluminium, had been \"very busy\" throughout 2021 so far. \"We have had some bespoke projects, but we have seen general work has increased,\" she said. The managing director said the manufacturing industry \"didn't really stop through most of 2020 and it has continued to increase\". It has led to PPS deciding to invest further in its operations despite initially thinking it was \"too risky\" due to the pandemic, Ms Davies-Chinnok added. However, rising material and supply costs had led to the firm increasing its prices to customers. \"We have had three price increases this year, which is unheard of,\" said Ms Davies-Chinnok. \"But we can't finance doing business with our customers when our suppliers are increasing their costs to us.\" She added that PPS, which is very energy intensive business, was \"incredibly lucky\" by the fact it had renewed its energy contracts last December, before wholesale gas prices surged worldwide. Longer term, Ms Davies-Chinnok said the biggest threat to her sector \"has to be climate change\" and said industry and government had to look at ways to make greener energy. Business leaders expressed caution about the outlook, with Suren Thiru, head of economics at the British Chambers of Commerce, saying the data points to the UK economy \"only likely to return to its pre-pandemic level next year, behind many of our international competitors\". \"Although monthly output rebounded through the quarter from July's contraction this is more likely to reflect a temporary boost from restrictions easing, rather than a meaningful improvement in the UK's underlying growth trajectory,\" he said. The ONS highlighted the impact of supply chain problems, which businesses have been struggling with for several months as they adjust to labour shortages and disruption at container ports. Stocks held by manufacturers fell during the July-to-September quarter, the ONS said. And a slowdown in new UK car sales was in large part due to a global shortage of microchips. The ONS also noted that retailers were reporting \"lower than usual\" stock for the time of year. As expected, the UK economic rebound from the coronavirus restrictions slowed in the third quarter of the year between July and September. The fact that this was a little lower than expected, and lower than other G7 European economies, reinforces some concerns about the strength of the recovery in the face of supply chain challenges and consumer weakness. The economy has still not caught up with its losses during the pandemic. On a quarterly basis, the gap is still 2.1% and will not be filled until into next year. Using monthly data, it is smaller. The good news is that the service sector has now almost made up its pandemic losses, reflecting the success of the vaccine programme in reopening the economy. The challenge now is in navigating some global and local headwinds, while the Bank of England will be starting to raise rates, and taxes and energy bills are heading up. The latest growth figures were weaker than many economists had expected, and Paul Dales, chief UK economist at Capital Economics, said the data suggested \"the best of the recovery is now behind us\". \"We think progress is going to slow over the next six to nine months as shortages remain an issue and the real spending power of businesses and households is reduced by higher taxes and rising utility prices,\" he added. The economic slowdown comes after the Bank of England held off from raising interest rates last week despite rising inflation. It wanted to see how the jobs market and wider economy was holding up after the end of furlough support. The Bank had already said it expected growth to slow to 1.5% in the July-to-September quarter and forecasts it will pull back further to 1% in the final three months of 2021. Mr Dales said the slower growth probably would not stop the Bank raising interest rates slightly in December, but could limit further rises next year. Separately, Britain's trade deficit in goods widened by £9bn in the third quarter to £42.3bn, the ONS said, driven by rising imports from EU and non-EU countries as exports fell - especially to non-EU countries.

            "content": "Chemicals company Johnson Matthey has scrapped plans to capture a slice of the market for electric car batteries in a surprise move that saw its shares tumble up to 20%. It said rivals were too far ahead in the technological race, and the battery chemicals arm would go up for sale. Johnson Matthey is a major producer of catalytic converters that clean exhaust emissions from petrol and diesel cars. But with the pending ban on such cars, it needs alternative revenue sources. The company is thought to have spent hundreds of millions of pounds trying to commercialise a chemicals project called eLNO, aimed at improving the efficiency of batteries. There were high hopes the company would play a key role in helping the UK develop a large-scale electric battery manufacturing sector. But chief executive Robert MacLeod, who also announced on Thursday he would step down next year, said the potential returns from the battery division could not justify further investment. He said: \"This decision will allow us to accelerate our investment and focus on more attractive growth areas, especially where we have leadership positions such as in hydrogen technologies, circularity and the decarbonisation of the chemicals value chain,\" Electric truck maker Rivian soars on market debut\nMajor carmakers fail to back zero emissions pledge Development of better-performing lithium-ion batteries is key to producing electric cars that can travel further on a single charge. The market is dominated by companies in China, South Korean and Japan. An exit from the market would more strongly tie Johnson Matthey's fate to the internal combustion engine at a time when the future of transport looks to be electric, said Hargreaves Lansdown analyst Laura Hoy. \"Ultimately the group will be starting over from square one as it looks for ways to change alongside the new greener auto industry,\" she said. Charlie Bentley, analyst at Jefferies, said that while the development of hydrogen transport will grow, \"it is very hard to believe these can be sufficient revenue drivers and replace the very significant earnings\" from Johnson Matthey's current operations. Mr MacLeod is being replaced in March next year by Liam Condon, the head of Germany's Bayer crop science unit. \"After nearly eight years as chief executive, the time is right for me to move on. I am confident in our future growth prospects,\" said Mr MacLeod. ",

            "content": "Vodafone has signed new deals with CityFibre and Openreach which it claims will make it the largest provider of full fibre broadband in the UK. Eight million UK residents will have access to its service by Spring 2022. The agreement with Vodafone will support CityFibre's pledge to reach 285 cities, towns and villages by 2025, in the UK. Analysts say the move should be good for consumers, as other providers push to have a similar reach. Gigabit broadband: Half-a-million rural homes to get boost Vodafone first partnered with CityFibre in 2017, in a deal thought to be worth around £500 million. The \"alt-network\" is the largest company outside of the main telecom giants to lay fibre in the UK in recent years, with around 50 internet providers currently making use of its infrastructure. \"A couple of years back we were new to broadband but by spring we will have the widest fibre-to-the-premises footprint in the UK,\" Ahmed Essam, chief executive of Vodafone UK, told the Financial Times. Mr. Essam said that by not owning its own fixed-line network the company has been free to expand its reach at a faster rate than otherwise would have been possible. \"BT will always sell on BT. Virgin Media will always sell on Virgin Media,\" he said of his main rivals.  Mark Jackson, editor at ISPreview, told the BBC that the move is likely to have a positive impact on consumers. \"Crucially, this change isn't unique to Vodafone, with CityFibre looking to provide a similar level of nationwide coverage to other ISPs. \"We fully expect the likes of TalkTalk, for example, to follow suit in the near future. For consumers, this simply means a greater degree of choice, which is often faster and more affordable than what they had access to before. That's a good thing,\" he added. ",

            "content": "A grandfather has told of how he lost money saved for Christmas presents after his family were duped by fraudsters on WhatsApp. The 75-year-old, who wished to remain anonymous, said they had been tricked by criminals posing as his grand-daughter on the messaging service. He transferred £1,550 to the con-artists, for an emergency medical bill that was a fake. WhatsApp and trading standards officers are warning others of the scam. Fraudsters posing as the young student sent a message to her father, saying she had a case of haemorrhoids that she was embarrassed to talk about. Subsequent messages suggested that she needed money for private medical care and asked for the money to be transferred directly. The correct spelling of her unusual name helped convince the family it was genuine, and her grandfather agreed to pay the supposed bill. Attempts to contact her directly failed, as the calls went straight to an answerphone. Only after the money was paid did they get through to her, and realised they had been tricked. \"You feel such a fool,\" her grandfather said. \"I was angry that I was able to be duped. \"You get used to these scam calls, but they are getting quite clever. I used to run my own business, so if they can fool people like me, a lot of very vulnerable people will be in trouble.\" He is trying to get the money refunded from his bank, but so far they have said their fraud checks were sufficient and have refused to reimburse him. Surveys have suggested that 59% of those asked had received a message-based scam attempt in the last year. Younger age groups, who were more likely to text than call, were said to be more exposed to these kinds of scams. WhatsApp hijack scam continues to spread\nFraudsters steal £4m a day as crime surges Trading standards officers said that scammers sent messages that appeared to come from a friend or member of the family, before asking for personal information, money, or a six-digit code. Usually you would need this code when setting up a new account, or logging in to your existing account on a new device. However, if you have not initiated this request, it could be a scammer trying to log in to your account. The messages are sent from the compromised accounts of friends, or from an unknown number claiming to be a friend who has lost their phone or been locked out of their account. \"These kinds of scams are particularly cruel as they prey on our kindness and desire to help friends and family,\" said Louise Baxter, head of the National Trading Standards scams team. Advice from WhatsApp includes: Stop. Take five minutes before responding. Make sure your WhatsApp two-step verification is switched on to protect the account\nThink. Ask if the request makes sense. Scammers prey on people's kindness, trust and willingness to help\nCall. Verify that it really is your friend or family member by calling them directly Kathryn Harnett, policy manager at WhatsApp, commented: \"WhatsApp protects our users' personal messages with end-to-end encryption, but we want to remind people that we all have a role to play in keeping our accounts safe by remaining vigilant to the threat of scammers. \"If you receive a suspicious message, even if you think you know who it is from, calling or requesting a voice note is the fastest and simplest way to check someone is who they say they are. A friend in need is a friend worth calling.\" The cost to all scam victims' wellbeing has been estimated at a collective monetary total of £9.3bn a year, according to the consumer group Which?.

            "content": "The US Justice Department (DoJ) is suing ride-hailing app Uber over allegations it has been overcharging disabled people. The DoJ claims Uber's \"wait time\" fees are discriminating against disabled passengers who need more than two minutes to get into a car. It says Uber needs to comply with the Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA). But Uber said wait time fees were not intended to apply to disabled riders and that it had been refunding fees. Kristen Clarke, assistance attorney general for the DoJ's civil rights division said the lawsuit aimed to send a \"powerful message that Uber cannot penalise passengers with disabilities simply because they need more time to get into a car\". Uber and other companies that provide transportation services \"must ensure equal access for all people, including those with disabilities,\" she added. Uber ordered to pay $1.1m to blind passenger\nParalympian issues Uber wheelchair plea\nWhy is it so hard to find a minicab? However, Uber said it disagreed that its policies were in violation of the the ADA. A spokesman said the company had been in talks with the DoJ before the \"surprising and disappointing\" lawsuit. Wait time fees were \"never intended for riders who are ready at their designated pickup location but need more time to get into the car\", he said. Uber had a policy of refunding wait time fees for disabled riders whenever they alerted the firm that they had been charged, the spokesman said. \"After a recent change last week, now any rider who certifies they are disabled will have fees automatically waived,\" he added. Uber began charging passengers for driver waiting times in 2016. The firm says riders are charged on average less than 60 cents, and that wheelchair-accessible trips or Uber Assist trips do not have any wait time fees by default. It is not the first time that Uber has found itself in hot water over disability issues. In April, it was ordered to pay a blind woman in San Francisco $1.1m after she was refused rides on 14 occasions. In the UK, Paralympic medallist Jack Hunter-Spivey said in September that Uber and other taxi drivers regularly drove off when they saw that he was a wheelchair user. A 2020 study by the University of Tennessee found that it takes 28% more income for a disabled person in the US to achieve the same standard of living as a non-disabled person. Maria Town, president and chief executive of the American Association of People with Disabilities (AAPD), who has cerebral palsy, told the BBC that disabled people often face a \"disproportionate economic burden, often as a result of realities they cannot change nor control\". In addition to higher costs for health care, medical supplies and accessibility tools, the practice of applying extra fees for services, such as grocery delivery or rideshare wait times, adds an additional \"tax\" for disabled consumers, she said. Ending the practice of charging wait-time fees for disabled riders would be a \"step in the right direction toward economic equality and dignity\", Ms Town added. The AAPD said it had seen many cases where Uber drivers had driven away when they saw that the passenger was using a wheelchair, crutches, a walker or a service dog. \"The presence of disability alone sometimes is enough, it's a huge issue,\" Ms Town said, recalling an incident from 2017 concerning a man in Texas who had a genetic disorder that affected his appearance. She also said that it was unfair of Uber to expect disabled people to use only its wheelchair-accessible services or Uber Assist. \"It's not fair on a number of fronts - there's a limited supply of these cars on the road, but also people with disabilities may not want assistance,\" she stressed. Forcing someone to take an assist ride could cause \"some tense driver-rider interactions that are completely unnecessary,\" Ms Town said. ",

            "content": "Boeing has reached an agreement with the families of the 157 people who died in the Ethiopia 737 Max crash in 2019. The plane maker accepts liability for their deaths, according to court documents in Chicago. In return, families of the victims will not seek punitive damages from the company. Lawyers for the victims' families said Boeing would still be held \"fully accountable\", welcoming the agreement as a significant milestone. Boeing shares fell 1% to $218.50 on the news. The agreement opens the way for families outside the US, in countries such as Ethiopia and Kenya, to claim compensation through the US courts, rather than in their home countries, which might be more difficult and result in lower payments. Former Boeing 737 Max pilot charged with fraud\nBoeing directors face investor lawsuit over crashes\nBoeing to pay $2.5bn over 737 Max conspiracy Mark Pegram in the UK, whose son Sam was one of the victims, said: \"The main positive for us is that Boeing is admitting liability, and not diverting blame onto Ethiopian Airlines or the pilots... we wanted them to hold their hands up.\" Sam's mother Debbie told the BBC: \"All we are looking to do with any compensation is set up a charity in Sam's name. It's what we want to do and it's what Sam would have wanted us to do.\" At the time of the crash, the 737 Max was Boeing's best-selling plane. But two fatal accidents within five months - the Ethiopia Airlines flight out of Addis Ababa and before that a Lion Air jet that came down into the sea off Indonesia - signalled there were serious faults with the aircraft. The planes were grounded for 20 months, while investigations took place, but have since been allowed to return to operations after the firm made significant changes to their software and training. Words are important and in this agreement Boeing accepts responsibility for the crash of ET302 - a disaster which claimed the lives of 157 people from 35 different countries. The world may have moved on and the 737 Max may be flying again, but for many of the families of those who died, the grief and sense of loss remains very raw indeed. In the period since the two accidents involving the 737 Max, Boeing has faced criticism for appearing to deflect blame elsewhere, for example by questioning the abilities of the pilots. So that admission of liability really does matter. For Boeing, the agreement provides some protection, by removing the possibility of relatives seeking potentially very high punitive damages and by making it unlikely current or former executives will be called to testify in court. Alongside the settlement reached in a lawsuit bought by shareholders last week - who had been suing the company over unsafe business practices - it removes much of the legal jeopardy the aerospace giant had been facing. But the company has made a significant concession. It has agreed that all compensation claims can be made under US law, which provides for much higher levels of compensation than would apply in many other countries. The agreement reached in Chicago, Illinois, where Boeing is headquartered, opens the way for compensation claims to be made. While it does not stipulate any specific level of compensation for the victims' families, the agreement will limit the scale and scope of any further procedures. Legal experts say it makes the prospect of current or former Boeing executives testifying in court much less likely. \"Boeing is committed to ensuring that all families who lost loved ones in the accidents are fully and fairly compensated for their loss,\" the plane maker said in a statement. \"By accepting responsibility, Boeing's agreement with the families allows the parties to focus their efforts on determining the appropriate compensation for each family.\" Lawyers for the victims released a statement saying that under the agreement, Boeing admitted \"that the 737 Max had an unsafe condition, and that it will not attempt to blame anyone else\" for the crash. \"This is a significant milestone for the families in their pursuit of justice against Boeing, as it will ensure they are all treated equitably and eligible to recover full damages under Illinois law, while creating a pathway for them to proceed to a final resolution, whether through settlements or trial,\" the lawyers said. In January, Boeing agreed to a deferred prosecution agreement with the US Department of Justice, including $2.5bn (£1.9bn) in fines and compensation stemming from the 737 Max crashes, including the Lion Air crash in October 2018.

The typical pay for graduates rose to £30,500 in 2021, up by £833, while school leavers saw a jump of £1,039, according to the Institute of Student Employers (ISE). Its boss Stephen Isherwood said that \"employers are looking for ways to compete for talent in a tough market\". The number of applicants per job also reached a record high, it found. 'I'm on top of the world because I have a job'\nHow do I find a new job and who is hiring?\nJob-seekers turn to TikTok to post 'CareerTok' CVs In its survey, companies reported an average of 91 applications per graduate vacancy - a 17% increase on last year. It also marks the highest number since the ISE started collecting data in 1999. The 2021 cohort of graduates have been competing for jobs against last year's cohort, who graduated in the year the pandemic began. Chaeyld Casimir-Thomas graduated with a First Class degree in law last year but has struggled to get work in the legal industry. She is currently working for a recruitment agency. \"Within the last two months I have applied for about a hundred jobs, both within and outside of the [legal profession],\" she says. \"It hasn't met my expectations of what I thought graduate life would be like.\" Chaeyld thought she would have a range of opportunities, \"even though law is a very difficult sector to get into\", considering her qualifications. \"I am hopeful for the future,\" she adds, \"but it has been difficult for me, and a couple of friends who I know who have graduated as well.\" Despite that, 177 respondents, each large employers of students and young people, suggested that the jobs market had still not recovered to pre-pandemic levels. Mr Isherwood pointed out that after the financial crisis in 2008, graduate salaries stagnated for a couple of years. The increase in salaries suggests that costs for businesses have also gone up, in \"another sign that businesses need to invest more to hire graduates\", he said. \"Market forces will determine how sustainable this is. If the economic recovery continues at pace then the market for young people will become increasingly competitive and employers will need to invest more to recruit the talent they need,\" he added. The most popular roles identified in the study were in retail and tourism, which received 182 applications per vacancy. In the wake of the pandemic, competition for jobs in the health and pharmaceutical industry was also high with 155 people applying for each job. Nearly 120 graduates applied for a financial and professional services role, according to the survey. The bosses surveyed in September predicted that growth across all different sectors would carry on into 2022. They also expected that graduate jobs and internships would exceed pre-pandemic levels over the next year. ",

Yet Rivian only started delivering its first electric pick-up trucks to customers in September. And the California-based start-up has made losses of over $2bn over the last two years.

The company has beaten rivals include Ford and General Motors to design and produce a pick-up truck and is due to start rolling out its sports utility vehicle (SUV) in December and a delivery van in 2023. It's a segment of the market popular with Americans but considered challenging to decarbonise. \"Rivian exists to create products and services that help our planet transition to carbon neutral energy and transportation,\" said RJ Scaringe, the company's founder and chief executive, in the firm's submission to the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), ahead of the share flotation. \"This is what inspired me to start Rivian, and it's what drives every decision we make as an organisation.\" The firm was founded in 2009 as Mainstream Motors, changing in 2011 to Rivian, a name derived from \"Indian River\". Originally Mr Scaringe pursued the idea of an electric sports car but later changed track to focus on trucks and vans. Recently Rivian has invested heavily in production of the R1T which is designed as an aspirational, outdoor adventure style vehicle. It comes with the option of a three person tent roof attachment and a slide-out kitchen unit for cooking in the wild. But crucial to investors' interest is the firm's relationship with Amazon, which not only owns 20% of Rivian, but has also said it will buy 100,000 electric delivery vans from the firm, once the firm starts to roll them out too. Not so long ago, US investors didn't have that much time for electric vehicles. But things have changed - and how! When Tesla went public in 2009, its shares were priced at $17 apiece, giving the company a total value of $1.5bn. Today, the share price stands at well over $1,000, and the value of the company at more than $1tn. That may explain at least some of the hype surrounding Rivian. EV businesses are simply hot property these days. Factor in powerful backing from Ford and Amazon, pickup trucks that look all-American, even if they run on batteries, with commercial vehicles as well, and you can see why the IPO has gathered such momentum. Rivian is not Tesla. Its products are very different, and deliberately so. But investors are clearly betting on the company one day becoming every bit as disruptive. Ford has also invested in the firm, as well as working on its own electric trucks. Karl Brauer at ISeeCars.com said there was a lot of excitement around the brand because of the backing it has already secured, and because it presents itself as a premium truck brand. \"It's not all about it being an electric vehicle. It's about it being an extremely effective truck that's powered by electricity,\" he said. \"I think people have a lot of anticipation, because they do feel like there's shades of Tesla here,\" he said. However he said Rivian's fortunes could be undermined by an economic downturn reducing demand, or by mechanical or production difficulties. There is already another cloud on Rivian's horizon. Its former vice president of sales and marketing, Laura Schwab is suing the company claiming she was was wrongfully dismissed after making a gender discrimination complaint about the \"toxic bro\" culture at the company. She also says she warned the company its delivery targets were \"not achievable\". ",

            "content": "Americans' cost of living is rising faster than it has for three decades, with food and fuel driving the increases. The consumer prices index for October showed prices rose 6.2% over the last twelve months. It marks a sharp jump from September when prices were already rising at 5.4%. Inflation has been a growing concern for shoppers and policymakers this year as the impact of the pandemic persists. Rising prices for food, shelter, used cars and trucks and new vehicles were among the larger contributors, the Bureau for Labour Statistics said. Meat, fish and eggs rose more than other foodstuffs, while petrol, or gasoline, prices are at seven-year highs. Almost every sector saw some price inflation, except for airfares and alcoholic beverages. US Fed to trim pandemic stimulus from this month\nCan the US tackle soaring meat prices?\nUS heating bills set to surge as energy costs jump Bottlenecks in the supply of some goods, combined with increasing demand from customers as the vaccine programme allowed the economy to reopen, are partly to blame for the rises. A shortage of staff has prompted employers to raise wages in some sectors, too, which in turn can feed into higher prices. Even excluding the cost of food and fuel, which tend to be more volatile, prices were rising strongly at 4.6%. Bessy Clarke says she has mostly noticed the price of petrol going up. \"Steadily every week, it gets higher and higher,\" she says. \"I'm actively thinking about how I need to limit my gas trips.\" \"It takes over 30 bucks (£22) to fill my tank right now and it used to take about 23.\" The 29-year-old waitress from New Orleans, Louisiana says her food bills are also rising. \"We go to our local grocery store, and things that were 40 to 50 bucks a couple months ago are now creeping over 60. \"Even in the restaurant I work at, meat prices have gone up and now we're having to pass that price on to consumers.\" She's finding it impossible to save money, so is looking for a better paid job. \"I just hope that it eventually stabilises,\" she says. Taken on a monthly basis, the Bureau for Labour Statistics said prices rose 0.9% in October, after gaining 0.4% in September, illustrating the pace of acceleration. On an annual basis, prices are rising at their fastest pace since 1990. President Joe Biden said reversing the spike in inflation was a \"top priority\". However, the Federal Reserve, which is responsible for monitoring inflation and is independent from the government, has said it believes the current high rate is \"transitory\". As a result, the Fed is not expected to raise interest rates soon - the usual response to rising inflation. Last week, Federal Reserve chair Jerome Powell did announce a scaling back of the Fed's bond-buying programme, the first move towards a tightening of monetary policy. Many economists are warning inflation could prove more intractable as the scramble for staff and supplies continues to exert pressure on prices. \"I expect lots of eyeballs were bulging out of their sockets when they saw the number come in,\" said Seema Shah, chief strategist at Principal Global Investors. \"Inflation is clearly getting worse before it gets better, while the significant rise in shelter prices is adding to concerning evidence of a broadening in inflation pressures.\" Shelter refers to the cost of maintaining a home, including mortgage, rent and utilities costs. The news would \"heap pressure on the Fed\" to raise interest rates, she added. \"Yet it is doubtful they will act before late 2022.\" ",

            "content": "Four of the world's biggest carmakers have failed to sign a COP 26 summit pledge to only sell zero emissions cars and vans by 2035. Volkswagen, Toyota, Renault-Nissan and Hyundai-Kia were not among signatories to the climate summit declaration. China and US, which are the world's biggest car markets, were also absent from the list of signatories. Big car manufacturers that did sign up included Ford, General Motors, and Jaguar Land Rover. Check out more of the BBC's business stories from the COP26 summit The declaration, which was made at the COP 26 climate summit in Glasgow, called on signatories to speed up the global transition from cars that burn fossil fuels to zero emissions vehicles, which include electric cars and hydrogen fuel cell vehicles. The agreement signed by governments and city authorities across the world commits signatories to ending the sale of new cars that produce emissions in \"leading markets\" by 2035, and globally by 2040. Investors and banks said they would support the transition, and some fleet owners pledged to make their car and van fleets green. Some major carmakers were signatories, including Ford, General Motors, Jaguar Land Rover, Mercedes-Benz and Volvo. Governments that signed up included Canada, Denmark, India, Ireland, Mexico, the Netherlands, New Zealand, Sweden, and the UK - although Britain has already said it will ban sales of new petrol and diesel cars from 2030. Some US cities and states put their names to the list, including New York and California. Investors including Aviva and NatWest, and fleet owners including supermarkets Sainsbury's and Tesco also signed up. While some parts of the US such as Dallas, Los Angeles and New York City signed up, the US itself, which is the biggest car market, remained off the list. China, which is the second-largest car market, was also absent. Germany, the largest car market in the EU, did not sign up. The world's largest car manufacturers, VW and Toyota, were not on the list, alongside rival car giants Renault-Nissan and Hyundai-Kia. Volkswagen, which recently unveiled its ID.5 electric SUV, said that while it was creating electrified products, the environmental benefits of signing up to the pledge were not clear-cut when electricity production in the US and China is still heavily reliant on burning fossil fuels. A spokesman said major markets relying on fossil fuels to produce electricity means \"the argument isn't there\" for pledging to only sell electric and other zero emissions cars by 2035, adding: \"We are just being realistic.\" \"We believe that an accelerated shift to electro mobility has to go in line with an energy transition towards 100% renewables,\" the car giant said in a statement. \"The Volkswagen Group, representing business activities in all major markets worldwide, decided not to sign the declaration at this point in time.\" Toyota, which put its first commercially produced electric cars on the road in 1997, said it will \"provide the most suitable vehicles, including zero emission products, in response to the diverse economic environments, clean energy and charging infrastructure readiness, industrial policies, and customer needs in each country and region\". PM urges climate action as draft decision published\nWorld headed for 2.4C warming despite COP - report\nFossil fuel industry has biggest delegation at COP26COP 26 Transport in the EU and the US accounts for about a third of carbon dioxide emissions from those locations, which is one of the greenhouse gases contributing to global warming. Of that total, in the EU, about 70% comes from road transportation. For this declaration in Glasgow to have been a breakthrough, it needed the backing of major governments and car manufacturers, Professor David Bailey of the University of Birmingham Business School said. \"Without the US, China and Germany on board, we are not going to get vehicle emissions where we need to be by 2050,\" Professor Bailey said, adding that the big car makers also need to be \"on board\". He said that the US \"has a penchant for big pick-up\" trucks that will need to be electrified eventually, but a 2035 target for new sales would not gain popular support for US President Joe Biden. The car industry in Germany is split between car electrification and wanting to use synthetic fuels, while China is heavily reliant on coal, and building more coal power stations. China setting zero emissions vehicles sales targets would beg the question about why it was not committing to more electricity generation from renewables, he added. The UK launched the Zero Emission Vehicle Transition Council (ZEVTC), a group of 30 countries that \"have agreed to work together to make zero emission vehicles the new normal\", the government said. It also announced that all new heavy goods vehicles will be zero emission by 2040, with HGVs of 26 tonnes and under being phased out from 2035. Industry body the Road Haulage Association said that it was \"concerned about the timing of phasing out some sizes of new trucks from 2035\". The RHA's managing director of policy and public affairs, Rod McKenzie said: \"We support the government's aim to decarbonise but the pace may be impossibly fast. Care is needed to ensure that all markets are served and future disruption to the supply chains are avoided. \"We would like the deadline extended for lorries over 18 tonnes by five years with support for hauliers in making the transition. \"Proven alternatives to diesel for all uses, locations, ranges and the heaviest trucks don't yet exist. It will require continuous review of the timeline over coming years to ensure a sustainable and successful transition to zero tailpipe lorries.\" The UK also announced a new design for electric vehicle charge points \"which could become as iconic as the Great British post box, London bus or black cab\" it said.

            "content": "The impact of Covid-19 has led to the loss of 21% of jobs at Southend Airport, its annual report revealed. Dwindling passenger bookings have seen the number of full time posts at the airport drop from 274 to 217. The airport said a \"small proportion\" was due to redundancy, with others choosing to leave over \"ongoing uncertainty\" in the industry, but it added it had been recruiting again. Southend Council welcomed the airport's optimism about the future. Passenger numbers at the airport fell from 2.15 million in 2019-20 to 147,000 in 2020-21, a reduction of 93%, the Local Democracy Reporting Service said. The decline led to the loss of retail outlets at the airport, including TRG, Dixons and WH Smith and airlines including EasyJet and Ryanair stopped using the airport. It has been confirmed passenger flights will not resume until the summer, but the airport has said it would be ready when things return to normal. Addressing job losses in its annual report, it said: \"A relatively small proportion of this was due to redundancy, to which 19 roles were lost. \"The majority of the change was due to natural wastage, with some people choosing to exit the aviation industry in light of ongoing uncertainty. \"Nevertheless, in the early part of calendar 2021, the airport began recruiting - including security, air traffic control and functional management roles, with an additional focus on apprenticeships - albeit against as yet undefined start dates. \"The airport anticipates a return to growth in the not-too-distant future as short haul and leisure traffic will return more quickly than long haul and business travel.\" Ron Woodley, the independent deputy leader of the council, said: \"It's encouraging airlines are seeing the light at the end of the tunnel. \"We will have to wait and see, but if Southend themselves are being optimistic maybe the airlines are also optimistic. \"Continuing to recruit and train is absolutely the right thing because they don't want to end up with a skeleton staff and not be able to keep up with things if they happen quickly in terms of growth of the industry.\" Find BBC News: East of England on Facebook, Instagram and Twitter.

            "header": "CEO Secrets: 'Wearing caps on video calls keeps us unified'",
            "content": "How do you foster team spirit when your 700-person workforce is suddenly working from home? One tech firm boss explains her tactics, for our business advice series, CEO Secrets. Lisa Utzschneider isn't wearing her baseball cap during our interview by video call, but for internal company meetings at the moment, it would be expected. \"Wearing our hats together, as a global organisation, unifies our team,\" she says. Her employees - usually based in offices dotted around the world - have been working from home during the past 18 months of the pandemic. As hybrid working becomes the norm this will remain the status quo for the majority for a while, although the New York and London offices, are now open. The caps are a way of \"showing up\" for work and proving you know everyone is in it together, she says. The pandemic has been a busy time for Ms Utzschneider, who became CEO of Integral Ad Science (IAS) in early 2019. The new job came with many challenges. She swiftly had to pivot company culture to suit lockdown conditions, float the company on the stock exchange, and deal with the challenges of being a parent of young children, all while working from home herself. IAS is the kind of company that has popped up in the past decade to serve a new digital need: verification of genuine audience engagement and reputation management in online advertising. Marketing budgets are increasingly spent on social media content, rather than television and print. There has been a sharp rise in the past decade in the amount of money brands spend directly on online influencers for instance, to spread their message. Globally, businesses have spent more money on digital advertising than traditional formats, since 2019, according to eMarketer. Economies like the US and UK reached this tipping point several years earlier. IAS works with some of the biggest brands in the world, like Nestle and Coca Cola. It makes sure their video adverts on social media platforms are being targeted effectively and in a way that doesn't create a bad impression of the brand - like rolling next to violent, highly politicised or sexually charged material. \"If you think of a Nestle advert running on YouTube,\" explains Ms Utzschneider, \"we verify that their video ad was viewed by a human and not a bot, and also that it ran next to safe and suitable content.\" The company's software algorithms gather and analyse vast amounts of data every day to do this. These huge companies don't want the social media platforms to be \"grading their own homework\", says Ms Utzschneider, explaining that a third party is needed to build trust. Advertisers spend hundreds of millions of dollars on these platforms so need to get a return on their investment, she says. At first, the social media platforms did not necessarily like this arrangement, but that response has changed, she says. YouTube \"did a complete 180\" in the Spring of 2019, she remembers, when it came under pressure from marketers about inappropriate and violent content appearing next to their adverts. Since then, the digital platforms have realised they need to become more transparent and allow a third party to inspect the service they are offering, she explains. Ms Utzschneider likens her company to Switzerland during the Second World War - a neutral observer in the online battle for people's attention, not directly involved in the fray. Ms Utzschneider's route to the top has been a progressive, steady one, with roles at some of tech's biggest behemoths along the way. In her mid-twenties, in the early 2000s, she was working in the non-profit, public policy sector, but decided to make the switch to the booming world of commercial technology. She left a senior role with the International Relief Committee to work for Microsoft. But the transition was not straightforward. She was rejected after the first round of interviews, something that still pains her. \"I rang the recruiters the next day to politely ask why they rejected me,\" she remembers, \"they said that I didn't display enough passion. So I said, 'give me another interview and I bet I can show you passion'.\" The tactic worked and she landed a different, entry level role as an account manager at MSN, Microsoft's digital advertising division. After a decade at Microsoft she took a job with Amazon, where she became global vice president of advertising sales, a chance to build a global advertising business. Marissa Meyer then persuaded her to join Yahoo to build an advertising business. All these jobs involved gruelling hours, but also the challenge of being a woman leader in the world of predominantly male senior tech leaders. \"I've been on hundreds, if not thousands, of conference calls, where I'm the only female dialling-in. I learned early the importance of finding your voice, showing up prepared, speaking up, early and often,\" she says. \"I've also developed a very strong muscle of… when others interrupt me, just politely calling them out. Or calling that peer afterwards on the phone to say, 'Hey, in the future can you give me some room in the meeting, so that I can share and contribute?' It made me very resilient.\" As a direct result of this experience she made it a \"strategic priority\" and a \"personal commitment\" to build a female-majority board when she became CEO of IAS. But back to those hats. The transition to home working has been the defining challenge for many businesses during the pandemic, however, in some ways, it made the IPO easier, says Utzschneider. She could do the roadshow of investor presentations online by video call from home - rather than the usual gruelling method of touring the country, living out of a suitcase. She could have dinner with her kids every evening. But the downside to working from home was, potentially, a disconnected company culture. So the hat-wearing custom became a visual statement that they didn't want to let that disconnect happen. She's worn her hat for town hall meetings, on-boarding sessions for new employees, analyst calls and investor meetings. \"Our hats-on mantra has unified the organisation,\" says Utzschneider. But what she hadn't expected, is that the hats also help with family life. \"When my two young girls see I have the hat on, they know mum's at work, and that means they can't really come in and visit me, but when I come downstairs for a meal, they'll tell me: 'Mom, it's time to take your hat off!' People have become more upfront and open about talking to their colleagues about their personal priorities, which can have a profound effect on simple things like time management, says Utzschneider. For example, working parents can't always stay for \"just another five minutes\" at the end of the meeting, and shouldn't have to accept a two-night work trip when a one-night one is possible, allowing them to put their kids to bed an extra night. These conversations are happening more and more at work now, she finds. \"It's a more transparent way of working, that lets us support each other, and spend that quality time with our loved ones.\" CEO Secrets reporter Dougal Shaw is on Twitter: @dougalshawbbc ",

            "content": "UK property remains a sellers' market, according to property portal Rightmove, with Grays in Essex named as the top spot for vendors. It said eight in 10 properties listed for sale on the website in the area have already had offers accepted. Some coastal towns also appear on the list of in-demand areas, as pandemic priorities among buyers for indoor and outside space continues. Chelsea in London is calculated to be the best market for buyers at present. A surge in house prices in the last 18 months has been driven to a considerable extent by high demand from buyers which has been unmatched by the number of homes on the market. The epicentre of Britain's house price boom\nSurge in house prices predicted to slow\nRents price us out of city, says van-living woman Rightmove analysed listings in each area, calculating the proportion of properties that were sold subject to contract. That means an offer has been accepted, but the sale - and potentially the final price - are still to be confirmed. It found that Grays, a town on the Thames 20 miles from East London, and Mangotsfield near Bristol both had 84% of listed properties sold subject to contract. Also in the 10 areas with the highest proportion of listings with offers accepted were Eastleigh, Redditch, Yeovil, Hythe, Gosport, Corby, Fareham, and Bognor Regis. At the other end of the scale were Bayswater in London, with 14% of listings sold subject to contract, Aberdeen with 14% and Chelsea with 13% listings at that stage. The areas with listings least likely to be the subject of offers are primarily in London. Analysts also found that that eight out of 10 houses for sale for £250,000 or below in Britain were sold subject to contract. There was more demand for houses than flats, the research found. Tim Bannister, Rightmove's director of property data, said: \"Sellers have had a better chance this year than at any time over the past decade of finding a buyer for their home. \"Over the past year the higher price brackets have been performing strongly, helped by the temporary stamp duty exemption threshold increasing to £500,000, but the tapering until the end of September has helped the mass market of £250,000 and below emerge as the strongest market more recently. \"The race for space is still a critical need for many, but smaller homes are now coming back into the most competitive property types, which is helping to sustain demand in the lower priced brackets.\" ",

            "content": "It's a familiar sight scrolling through YouTube, TikTok and Instagram: A teenager dumps a \"haul\" of clothing from Shein on her bed, trying on each outfit in turn for likes and followers. The popularity of the Chinese fast fashion firm has exploded during the pandemic. But if you're over 30? Odds are you haven't heard of it. Targeting trend (and cost) conscious shoppers on social media, the online-only giant adds a staggering 6,000 new items to its range daily. But it's also drawn criticism over its environmental impact, a lack of transparency and allegations it copies small designers, which Shein denies and says it takes seriously. So what's behind the success of the company leaving rival fashion brands Asos and Boohoo in the dust? The little-known founders of Sheinside got together in 2008, led by entrepreneur Chris Xu, who started out in digital marketing and selling wedding dresses online. With a shortened name, Shein (pronounced She-in) started out in its current form five years later. Although it's based in China, the firm mainly targets customers in the US, Europe and Australia with its cut-price crop-tops, bikinis and dresses, costing just £7.90 ($10.70) on average. Today it's one of the biggest players in fast fashion, shipping to 220 countries. The Covid crisis provided the company with a sales boost, says Richard Lim, chief executive of independent consultancy Retail Economics. \"Lockdowns meant that many consumers spent more time browsing online and the fight for brand awareness was taking place across digital platforms. \"This helped the online retailer grow its presence and reach a wider audience more quickly.\" While the private company doesn't disclose financial figures, data provider CB Insights estimates that sales topped 63.5bn yuan (£7.4bn/$10bn) in 2020. At any one time, Shein has as many as 600,000 products for sale on its online platform. It relies on thousands of third-party suppliers, as well as about 200 contract manufacturers, near its headquarters in Guangzhou. In what author and Chinese technology expert Matthew Brennan has branded \"real-time retail\", smaller companies along its supply chain are fed information from its in-house tools on what's trending or how well certain products are performing. Based on that data, they produce a batch of 50-100 items per style. If it does well? Shein orders more. If not, it's discontinued. Shein investigates ‘false’ anti-Uyghur job ads\nShein apologises for selling Muslim prayer mats\nCan fashion ever be sustainable? Shein can turn around a new item in about 25 days. For many retailers, it can take months. It has accelerated the \"test and repeat\" model, made famous by the likes of H&M and Zara owner Inditex. Just 6% of Shein's inventory remains in stock for more than 90 days, the BBC understands. The company ships orders to its customers directly, mostly from one 16 million square foot warehouse on the outskirts of Guangzhou. But its packages often take at least a week to arrive in markets such as the UK and US, unlike competitors such as Boohoo, Asos or OhPolly which offer next-day delivery. Using an army of influencers, from student \"campus ambassadors\" to reality stars such as Made in Chelsea's Georgia Toffolo, Shein has amassed more than 250 million followers across its social media channels. Shein's online presence has been a big driver of its success \"as it boosts brand awareness and engagement\", says Emily Salter, a retail analyst at GlobalData. Targeting advertising and sponsoring influencers on Instagram and TikTok has helped it remain relevant among the youngest shoppers. These efforts have been boosted by the fact that it often hosts live shows on its platforms to promote its products. \"This is more unique to Shein, as live streaming is used less by Western brands but has huge potential to drive sales, as evidenced in China,\" says Ms Salter. Its use of customer data has sparked concerns in the UK, however. Shein was recently described as \"manipulative\" by web design agency Rouge Media, which identified eight prompts on its website encouraging shoppers to spend more money or give away personal data in exchange for discounts or reward points. In a study, it analysed 30 of the biggest fast fashion retailers in the UK and scored their websites according to how many of these prompts customers saw before making a purchase. Chair of the Foreign Affairs Committee Tom Tugendhat said: \"Millions of people are signing away their personal data for cheap clothes.\" He added: \"When the price is too good you have to ask who is really paying and how.\" During the first coronavirus lockdown, 27-year-old Heather McCurry thought she would order some new leggings to get her through YouTube workouts at home. Shein's Facebook adverts caught her eye: \"Because it's a fast fashion company, you can go on every day and there's new clothes added at a reasonable price.\" Eventually, she also snapped up homeware, joggers and even got her mum into shopping on the website. But it isn't without its faults, she says. Heather suggests that some discount items of clothing have been of a lesser quality. While she admits she has seen comments online questioning the environmental impact of ultra-fast fashion and how much Shein's workers are paid, she would buy from the company again in future. \"I doubt that any action I would take would make that much difference.\" Building a colossal range of products and styles at speed means that Shein has come under fire on several fronts. It has been criticised for selling items such as a Muslim prayer mat described as a \"Greek carpet\", which it was forced to withdraw. It has also been accused of copyright infringement and faces lawsuits from the likes of the maker of Dr Martens boots, although the e-retailer has previously denied any wrongdoing. The fast fashion giant employs 200 in-house designers, out of more than 7,000 employees. A senior Shein executive told the BBC that it also has a team reviewing new designs by its suppliers before they reach the website, to try to filter out any infringement issues, which it takes seriously. Although the firm has paid out more than $1m (£741,000) to independent designers to date, Twitter still sees complaints from smaller businesses. Some claim that Shein has allegedly copied their designs and sold similar items at a lower cost. Shein X, the retailer's tutorial programme, recently ran a competition for young designers with a $100,000 (£74,227) prize and fashion collection on offer in a bid to boost its credentials. Social media users criticised the move though, asking why judges such as fashion designer Christian Siriano and celebrity Khloe Kardashian would attach their names to the project. The prices of Shein's products have also raised questions about its environmental footprint and its labour practices, like many of its rivals. It's a huge challenge, with the fashion industry accounting for up to 8% of global carbon emissions, according to one UN study. Roberta Lee, a sustainable fashion stylist, points out that Shein and other fast fashion firms often use polyester fabrics, which rely \"on pulling more oil and coal from the ground\" and don't biodegrade like natural materials. She accuses the company of \"preying on the fears of outfit repetition syndrome\", with Shein pieces in haul videos \"likely to be discarded to landfill after just a few wears and washes\". The Chinese brand insists that its method of producing clothes in small batches is more efficient and that little goes to waste. A spokesperson said that its business model \"balances consumers' wants and needs and the inventory process\". It also points out on its website that it wants to source more recycled fabrics and uses printing technology that is less polluting than traditional screen printing for graphics and patterns. Meanwhile, a recent investigation by BBC News revealed that job adverts for workers at Shein factories and warehouses appeared on Chinese recruitment websites, which said that those from certain ethnic backgrounds, including Uighur people, must not apply. Shein said it did not fund or approve the ads and it was committed to \"upholding high labour standards\". A Shein spokesperson told the BBC that it has \"zero-tolerance policies for forced and child labour and discrimination\". Its customer base, retail analyst Emily Salter says, are \"quite contradictory shoppers\" overall, with Gen Z more willing to buy second-hand and rent clothing, but also making up the core of fast fashion brands like Shein that have come under intense scrutiny.

            "content": "The Bank of England and the Treasury are to launch a formal consultation on a UK central bank digital currency. This evaluation of the design and possible benefits of a new kind of digital money is a further step towards its possible creation. The currency, for use by households and businesses, would sit alongside cash and bank deposits, rather than replacing them. No decision has been taken on whether to have such a currency in the UK. But the consultation in 2022 will form part of a \"research and exploration\" phase and will help the Bank and government develop the plans over the following few years. Central banks around the world are developing or exploring digital currencies after the rise of crypto-currencies such as Bitcoin. China, for example, is a front-runner in this global race, and is in the process of testing a digital yuan in major cities including Beijing, Shanghai and Shenzhen. Its next steps are to improve the eCNY currency's privacy protections and to improve how it interacts with other payments tools, People's Bank of China governor Yi Gang said on Tuesday. The UK's central bank digital currency (CBDC) is not so far advanced as the Chinese effort, with the earliest date for the launch of a UK CBDC in the second half of the decade. The consultation paper will set out an assessment from the Treasury and the Bank of the case for a CBDC before a decision on whether to proceed. \"A technical specification would follow the consultation explaining the proposed conceptual architecture for any CBDC. \"This could involve in-depth testing of the optimal design for, and feasibility of, a UK CBDC,\" the Bank said in a statement. New York's next mayor wants to be paid in Bitcoin\nRevealed: The Cryptoqueen's £13.5m London penthouse\nSquid Game crypto token collapses in apparent scam Financial services minister John Glen said a retail CBDC would be used by people and businesses for everyday payments needs and help Britain stay at the forefront of innovation and technology in the financial sector. The European Central Bank in July took a first step towards launching a digital version of the euro, kicking off a 24-month investigation phase to be followed by three years of implementation. Work on a digital euro accelerated after Facebook unveiled plans to create its own currency in 2019, although Facebook later thought again about its Libra currency after strong opposition from regulators, and renamed it \"Diem\" . While China has been at the forefront of CBDC moves, the US Federal Reserve has been more sceptical. Some central banks have warned that widespread use of CBDCs could deprive banks of a cheap and stable source of funding from consumer deposits. Last month, Nigeria was the first African country to launch a CBDC pilot and in September, El Salvador became the first country to use the virtual Bitcoin currency as a legal tender, alongside the US dollar. It led to widespread protests as demonstrators feared it would bring instability and inflation to the country. ",

            "header": "Food price rises highest since August 2020, says Kantar",
            "content": "Food prices are rising at their fastest pace since August 2020, figures from data firm Kantar suggest, as supply chain disruption continues. Grocery inflation rose to 2.1% in October - the highest rate since last year, when retailers were cutting promotions amid the Covid pandemic. Last week, the Bank of England confounded market expectations by holding interest rates. But with overall inflation heading for about 5%, a rate rise is expected soon. Supply chains have been under pressure from factors including the pandemic and a shortage of lorry drivers. Retail and hospitality groups warned MPs on Tuesday that gaps on shelves and inflationary pressures would continue for the months ahead. Kantar said that the fastest rising food prices included savoury snacks, canned colas and crisps. However, prices fell for products such as fresh bacon, vegetables and cat and dog treats. Bank of England sorry for rising cost of living\nWhy is the cost of living going up? \"Grocery prices are rising and this month inflation hit its highest rate since August 2020, when retailers were still cutting promotions to maintain stock on the shelves,\" said Fraser McKevitt, head of retail and consumer insight at Kantar. \"As prices increase in certain categories, we can expect shoppers to continue to visit several supermarkets and shop around to find the best deals.\" Official figures showed overall UK inflation dipped slightly in September, with the rate falling to 3.1% in the year to September, down from 3.2% in October. However, Shore Capital research analyst Clive Black said that some people were \"struggling to believe\" the inflation numbers from the Office for National Statistics. He said the figures were \"increasingly treated not with scepticism but incredulity as prices from fuel, energy, food, and building materials rise, offset by what?\" Fuel and oil prices have risen rapidly as economies start to pick up after being battered by the coronavirus pandemic, and as the Opec oil producers' cartel gradually increases output. Shortages and bottlenecks in goods including building materials and computer chips have also pushed up prices. Businesses are having difficulties recruiting workers to drive lorries, pick and process food and to staff bars, hotels and restaurants. This is partly to do with the pandemic but is being compounded by Brexit, according to international policy forum the OECD. However, the Bank of England's deputy governor Ben Broadbent stated the pandemic is having a greater impact on labour shortages than Brexit currently. Mr Broadbent stressed that it's not just a case of losing migrants as workers - but also their spending power in the economy, as many EU workers were younger and economically active. He added the pandemic has led to a fall in the active workforce that is \"not unique\" to the UK, shown by the retirement of HGV drivers and younger restaurant staff choosing to go into education. Kate Nicholls, chief executive officer of UK Hospitality, warned that prices charged by hospitality businesses such as restaurants, bars and hotels were set to rise after Christmas. Speaking to the House of Commons Environment, Food and Rural Affairs Committee on Tuesday, she said that many Christmas events offered by her members had been pre-booked, which made it harder to push through price increases to cover higher costs. \"You're going to see a really intense squeeze on margins in the run-up to Christmas,\" she said, but then prices were likely to rise in the new year. \"Some of our businesses are anticipating three price increases to consumers going through before we get to April.\" Andrew Opie, director of food and sustainability at the British Retail Consortium, told MPs it \"will be Christmas as we know it\" in shops, but the range of products will be reduced, as is already the case in lots of food categories. Several retailers have reported that customers are planning ahead for Christmas and shopping early amid concerns over shortages of stock. Kantar data supported this, with the firm saying that 4.7 million households bought mince pies this month. M&S: Customers are Christmas shopping early\nShoppers warned to buy early for Christmas or miss out Frozen poultry sales are 27% higher compared with last year, with people spending an additional £6.1m in the past four weeks. In addition, 1.6 million households bought their Christmas pudding in October as well, which is 400,000 more than last year, Kantar said. Customers are getting used to seeing gaps on shelves, and menu items missing in restaurants, and we're already shopping differently as a result. Gone are the days of the Christmas Eve mega-shop where you pile everything you need into an impossible to push trolley. Now we're buying early, freezing more, and throwing in a few extra bits when they are available, just in case. It's almost impossible for businesses to predict what those holes will be from one week to the next, as worker shortages in the supply chain continue to cause problems. That means we'll not only be shopping around to try and save money as prices rise, but we'll also have to try different stores at different moments just to get everything on the list. ",

            "header": "Primark says stock woes could persist until 2023",
            "content": "Discount fashion chain Primark has said it could face disruption from global supply chain issues into 2023, but it assured customers that \"we are getting the goods we need\". Chief executive George Weston told the BBC that Primark shops would be properly stocked for Christmas. The chain had prioritised seasonal items, he said. \"We do not see any crisis developing as we look forward - it's just more difficult,\" he added. Store closures during Covid lockdowns hit the retailer's annual sales, down by 12% on pre-Covid levels. Its parent firm, AB Foods, said Primark had lost one-third of its trading days in the 53 weeks to 18 September. But it added that it expected higher profits in the new financial year. Mr Weston said that despite difficulties with clogged ports and the UK's shortage of lorry drivers, the \"vast majority\" of items stocked by Primark were still available, subject to some minor gaps. \"Your size in basic T-shirts might not be available on a certain day, but it might be the next day,\" he said. In its latest results, Primark also announced big expansion plans, with new stores due to open in the US, France, Italy and Spain. Overall, it said its total store numbers would grow from 398 to 530 over the next five years, with the number of US outlets set to rise from 13 to 60. Mr Weston said Primark was now established in the US, adding: \"It's no longer a punt - it's a rollout of a business we understand, to customers we know well.\" Despite the negative impact of the pandemic, Primark has found that some habits that became established under lockdown are working to its advantage. For its autumn and winter range, the retailer said it was capitalising on the continued trend for \"comfort living\" and loungewear with the launch of what it called the \"snuddie\" - a \"snuggly oversized hoodie\", designed for \"those lazy days when your comfiest clothes just don't cut it\". Primark said the snuddie was \"attracting a strong response from customers across all markets\", with best-selling versions including an avocado print for men and a Minnie Mouse design for children. Unlike most High Street retailers, Primark has no online retail operations. It plans to overhaul its website early next year to give more details of in-store ranges, so customers can \"browse online, before they come into our stores\". Despite its digital revamp, Mr Weston said Primark still had no plans to allow shoppers to order its products for home delivery. \"We've never said never to things like click-and-collect, but we're first and foremost a bricks-and-mortar retailer and we will remain very profitable as that,\" he added. AB Foods said its adjusted pre-tax profits had fallen by 1% to £908m for the year, with the dip in sales at Primark offset by \"strong\" sales in its food business. The firm's chairman, Michael McLintock, said sales and profit were again below pre-Covid levels, but praised the \"agility\" of Primark's management in responding to \"the fast-changing and wide range of trading restrictions applied to our stores over the year\". \"The strength of Primark's sales after the reopening of all our stores in the spring demonstrated the relevance and appeal of our value-for-money offering,\" he added. Mr McLintock said AB Foods - which, as well as running Primark, also owns food brands such as Twinings, Ovaltine and Patak's - was seeing \"significant cost increases in energy, logistics and commodities, in addition to the impact of widely reported port congestion and road freight limitations\". \"Primark is not immune to the challenges of supply chain, raw material cost and labour rate inflation,\" he said. \"Our businesses are working to offset the impact of these through cost savings. Where necessary, our food businesses will also implement price increases,\" he added. When asked if these cost savings could lead to job losses, Mr Weston said: \"No, we're recruiting staff, not cutting.\" However, he added that Primark saw opportunities to make existing workers more productive, giving the example of how it had automated a warehouse in the Netherlands while keeping staff levels the same. The pandemic has proved costly for Primark. It lost £2bn in sales last year when its stores had to close. A third of its trading days were lost. But it's weathered the storm. All things being equal, it now hopes to more than make up the lost ground, assuming trading comes back to normal next year. And it has big plans for international expansion, with new stores in the US, France, Italy and Spain over the next five years. But Primark's having to paddle hard to mitigate all the cost pressures now building up. Although AB Foods' food business is putting prices up where necessary, passing costs on to shoppers is less easy to do at its fast-fashion chain. Primark says thanks to the weaker dollar and the steps it's taken to lower store costs, it hopes to broadly offset all the rising supply chain costs and inflationary pressures bearing down on the industry. Mr Weston said Primark had \"delivered a good performance in the face of continued disruption to trading caused by the pandemic\". \"Although the possibility of further trading restrictions cannot be ruled out, we expect Primark to deliver a much-improved margin and profit next year,\" he added. AB Foods' share price rose by 6% to £19.67 on Tuesday. ",

            "header": "Rolls-Royce gets funding to develop mini nuclear reactors",
            "content": "Rolls-Royce has been backed by a consortium of private investors and the UK government to develop small nuclear reactors to generate cleaner energy. The creation of the Rolls-Royce Small Modular Reactor (SMR) business was announced following a £195m cash injection from private firms and a £210m grant from the government. It is hoped the new company could create up to 40,000 jobs by 2050. However, critics say the focus should be on renewable power, not new nuclear. Currently, about 16% of UK electricity generation comes from nuclear power. Small modular reactors are nuclear fission reactors but are smaller than conventional ones. The investment by Rolls-Royce Group, BNF Resources, Exelon Generation and the government will go towards developing Rolls-Royce's SMR design and take it through regulatory processes to assess whether it is suitable to be deployed in the UK. It will also identify sites which will manufacture the reactors' parts and most of the venture's investment is expected to be focused in the north of the UK, where there is existing nuclear expertise. Rolls-Royce's share price jumped by 4.2% to 147.85p each following the announcement. Rolls-Royce SMR said one of its power stations would occupy about one tenth of the size of a conventional nuclear plant - the equivalent footprint of two football pitches - and power approximately one million homes. The firm said a plant would have the capacity to generate 470MW of power, which it added would be the same produced by more than 150 onshore wind turbines. Warren East, Rolls-Royce chief executive, said the company's SMR technology offered a \"clean energy solution\" which help tackle climate change. Business and Energy Secretary Kwasi Kwarteng said SMRs offered opportunities to \"cut costs and build more quickly, ensuring we can bring clean electricity to people's homes and cut our already-dwindling use of volatile fossil fuels even further\". \"This is a once in a lifetime opportunity for the UK to deploy more low carbon energy than ever before and ensure greater energy independence\", he added. SMRs are thought to be less expensive to build than traditional nuclear power plants because of their smaller size. Due to the nature of Rolls-Royce's reactors, it is understood parts could be produced in factories and transported to sites by road, which would reduce construction time and costs. At an expected cost of around £2bn each, SMRs would cost less than the £20bn each for the larger plant under construction at Hinkley Point and an anticipated, but not yet approved, sister plant at Sizewell in Suffolk. If approved for use in the UK, it is understood Rolls-Royce SMR could build up to 16 reactors across the UK for electricity production. Tom Samson, chief executive Rolls-Royce SMR, said the company had been established to \"deliver a low cost, deployable, scalable and investable programme of new nuclear power plants\". \"Our transformative approach to delivering nuclear power, based on predictable factory-built components, is unique and the nuclear technology is proven,\" he added. What does net zero mean?\nUK sets out net zero plans for greenhouse gases However, Paul Dorfman, chairman of the Nuclear Consulting Group think tank, told the BBC's Today programme there was danger that the money spent on nuclear power would hit funding for other power sources. \"If nuclear eats all the pies which it is looking to be doing… we won't have enough money to do the kind of things we need to do which we know practically and technologically we can do now,\" he said. Greenpeace's chief scientist Dr Doug Parr said SMRs were still more expensive than renewable technologies and added there was \"still no solution to dispose of the radioactive waste they leave behind and no consensus on where they should be located\". \"What's worse, there's not even a prototype in prospect anytime soon,\" he added. \"The immediate deadline for action is sharp cuts in emissions by 2030, and small reactors will have no role in that.\" Friends of the Earth's head of policy, Mike Childs, said government support should be \"aimed at developing the UK's substantial renewable resources, such as offshore wind, tidal and solar, and boosting measures to help householders cut energy waste\". As part of a \"10-point plan\" to dramatically reduce greenhouse gas emissions to reach a target of net zero by 2050, the government has said nuclear power provides a \"reliable source of low-carbon electricity\" and that it is \"pursuing large-scale nuclear\", while also looking to invest in SMRs. Tony Danker, director-general of the Confederation of British Industry, said the investment for Rolls-Royce was a \"hugely promising milestone for a technology that can not only boost the economy but help deliver a greener and more secure energy system overall\". Meanwhile, Tom Greatrex, chief executive of the Nuclear Industry Association, added the funding sent a \"huge signal to private investors that the government wants SMRs alongside new large-scale stations to hit net zero\".

            "header": "Climate change: Seven ways to spot businesses greenwashing",
            "content": "Most of us are trying to be greener and for some that means seeking out brands and companies that are environmentally-friendly. But how can you check firms really are as green as they make out? Greenwashing - branding something as eco-friendly, green or sustainable when this is not the case - misleads consumers into thinking they are helping the planet by choosing those products. And businesses are being held to account on this in the way they advertise. But what do customers need to look out for to spot greenwashing? Check out more of the BBC's business stories from the COP26 summit\nEfforts to curb energy tariffs 'greenwashing'\nGoogle, YouTube ban ads on climate misinformation\nAdvertising regulator to target greenwashing ads The Advertising Standards Authority says this is the area it receives the most complaints about. And some firms have already had adverts banned. In 2019, the advertising regulator banned a Ryanair ad claiming it was the airline with Europe's lowest emissions without sufficient evidence to support the claim. And a Hyundai advert, claiming a car \"cleaned the air\", was also judged by the ASA to be misleading. Ingredients in a product being described as \"natural\", \"organic\" or \"eco-friendly\", when only some of the ingredients can be described as this, can also fall into this category. Sue Davies, head of Consumer Protection Policy at Which? says, in general, customers should try to find a secondary, authoritative source of information to back up manufacturers' claims. \"Think about the bigger picture. For example, can environmental claims made on a single-use plastic water bottle be taken seriously?\" Phrases such as \"eco\", \"sustainable\" and \"green\" are commonly used by companies to make the business appear environmentally conscious - but they rarely pertain to any scientific standards. A website for HDS Group's Amazing Cleaners, seen in July 2016, featured the claim \"100% eco-friendly\". A complaint was upheld after it was found the statement was made without any evidence or explanation. And an advert for Alpro Almond milk was also banned for a misleading environmental claim. The ad said the milk was \"good for the planet\", branding it: \"Your recipe to a healthier planet.\" Alpro said customers would understand the ad's slogan referred to plant-based products having a lower environmental impact. But while the ASA said it understood the almonds used by Alpro were not sourced from areas where production could have a negative environmental impact, such claims must be clearer. In another example, Edward Bulmer Limited claimed in 2018 that its paint was \"the most eco-friendly paint on the market\". However, the Advertising Standards Authority held in 2019 that Edward Bulmer Limited (the company that then produced and sold Edward Bulmer Paint) \"had not supplied evidence of certification for their paints, nor had they supplied evidence which showed their paints scored more favourably in terms of their impact on the environment than other paints on the market.\" Fashion brands may promote clothes made of \"sustainable\" fabrics, even if the rest of their clothing line is damaging to the environment. For example, a firm could claim to be environmentally-friendly, but not take into account supply-chain emissions from a coal-powered overseas factory used to make part of a product. Other industries have fallen foul of this. As far back as 2007, the ASA ruled against Shell for an ad implying it used waste carbon dioxide to grow plants, when the regulator actually found the quantity used was only a small fraction of its emissions. A government, business or individual can attempt to balance their own emissions by finding other ways to remove an equivalent amount of greenhouse gases from the atmosphere. The process is called carbon offsetting. But environmental groups argue this is kicking the problem into the long grass rather than dealing with the issue of actually cutting emissions. David Barmes, senior economist at the campaign group Positive Money, says offsetting is the most popular form of greenwashing. \"It's riddled with fraud and allows firms to claim they're meeting emissions targets while they continuously pump emissions into the air.\" He adds: \"The whole point of offsets is to allow these corporations to keep emitting with impunity and allow governments to claim they are meeting targets.\" Larger firms, or conglomerations, with a high environmental impact have often bought smaller brands to target environmentally conscious customers who otherwise might not have chosen to spend with them. So knowing what, or who, the ultimate owner of a firm is could be important if you want to find out their entire environmental impact. Accountability and authenticity, Prof Eccles says, are serious problems. An entire businesses' carbon emissions, he says, should be like calorie labels on a product, where \"everyone pays attention to them, they are certified independently and they influence consumer decisions\". Professor Kimberly Nicholas, senior lecturer in sustainability at Lund University, in Sweden, told the BBC that the most effective action is for companies to commit to eliminating fossil fuels from each part of their supply chains: \"Customers need to direct their money away from all firms that are producing or connected to financing fossil fuels.\" She said: \"Without this action is useless.\" Some firms will market environmentally beneficial products, but will omit information about the impact of their other products. Food company Quorn had an ad banned which involved the way carbon was certified for one of their products. ASA said the advert did not clarify what the claimed reduction of the carbon footprint was being measured against, and viewers would therefore not know what the basis of the reduction was. Ms Davies, from Which?, says a lack of transparency is a key indicator that the company doesn't have a wholly positive environmental impact. \"If you're struggling to find environmental information about a product, brand or service, take that as a warning sign.\" \"Companies that have something to hide - or no good stories to tell - often make it harder for consumers to check out their eco credentials,\" she adds. The \"recyclable\" label on some plastic items can be used for products that are not easy to recycle. In 2018, McDonald's announced it was going to get rid of single-use plastic straws in its restaurants, and offer paper straws instead. But the following year, it was accused of greenwashing when it was revealed the straws weren't actually recyclable. In 2019, the ASA said Ancol Pet Products was misleading customers by advertising dog waste bags as biodegradable after it was found that they would not biodegrade in their most likely destination of landfill or incineration.

As part of its 10 point green energy plan, the government has already announced it would provide £210m in funding if that could be matched by private capital. An announcement that money has been raised could come as soon as Tuesday. Around 21% of Britain's electricity supply is provided by nuclear power. Jeff Bezos-backed fusion plant to be built in UK\nWhat does net zero mean?\nUS lab stands on threshold of key fusion goal The plan is thought to include the construction of an initial four Small Modular Reactors (SMRs) based on the technology used in nuclear powered submarines. These reactors will be capable of generating nearly 500 megawatts of power - three times as much as much as most existing nuclear submarine reactors but more than six times less than the 3.2 gigawatts that the large plant under construction at Hinkley Point will deliver. Hinkley is expected to produce enough power to supply 6 million homes. The investment to be announced on Tuesday is intended to fund the project up to the stage where the reactor design receives approval. No decision has yet been made on how the construction cost will be financed. At an expected ultimate cost of around £2bn each, they should cost less than a tenth of the £20bn each of Hinkley and an anticipated, but not yet approved, sister plant at Sizewell in Suffolk. Industry sources say they hope that these SMRs would be operational within a decade. Advocates of SMRs say their smaller size means they can be built in a controlled factory setting and installed module by module, reducing risk and cost. These reactors are not expected to be a substitute for another large-scale nuclear plant the government has said it is determined to approve this parliament - but in addition. The planned locations of these SMRs is not expected to be confirmed this week but industry sources suggest that existing nuclear sites are the obvious candidates. ",

Covid lockdowns led to a surge of sales of some items that people could enjoy at home or in the garden, or to keep up their fitness. Now, buyers' remorse has kicked in for some, who admitted typically spending nearly £1,400 on the items. Insurer Aviva said many expensive items were now gathering dust. Gaming equipment, DIY tools, home gyms, bikes, clothing and jewellery, musical instruments, kitchen appliances such as bread makers, garden furniture, pizza ovens and hot tubs all appeared on the regret list, the insurer said. Its survey of 4,000 people found some had sold or given away the items they regretted buying. Some used money which would have normally been spent on holidays or social events, while others had intended to use the lockdown to start new hobbies. Nicki Charles, a customer and marketing director at Aviva, said: \"So much has changed since the start of 2020.

The move comes after it emerged that Mr Cowgill was filmed meeting Barry Bown, his counterpart at Footasylum. JD Sports bought Footasylum for £90m in April 2019 but last week was ordered to sell it by the competition watchdog. There are concerns that the meeting may have contravened competition rules. Both firms deny any breach. The Competition and Markets Authority (CMA) has been examining the deal since May 2019 and put in place an enforcement order that states that meetings between bosses of the two companies are allowed, but they must not share any confidential or commercially sensitive information. News of the meeting came to light in an article published in the Sunday Times. JD Sports said on Monday: \"Peter Cowgill has known Barry Bown on a business and personal basis for over 25 years. \"As a result, it is not unusual, or in any way suspicious or illegitimate, for them to meet from time to time, including in relation to the ongoing review by the Competition and Markets Authority (CMA) of JD's acquisition of Footasylum Limited. \"The Sunday Times omitted to report on the positive obligation that JD has under the terms of the Interim Enforcement Order to take all reasonable steps to encourage key staff of the Footasylum business (which includes Barry Bown) to remain with the business.\" JD Sports boss rejects criticism of £4.3m bonus\nBrexit worse than feared, says JD Sports boss JD Sports said the CMA had been fully informed about the meeting, which took place on 5 July. The company also said: \"It is disappointing that the Sunday Times has not reported in a more balanced way on the highly irregular and potentially illegal covert surveillance undertaken by a third party for their own interests,\" the statement continued. \"JD hopes that a regulator, tasked with acting in the wider public interest, is able to more critically regard the actions of the third party for what they are.\" A CMA spokesperson said: \"These rules are put in place to protect consumers and other businesses operating in that market as we investigate a merger. We take compliance very seriously and thoroughly investigate any potential breaches. Where there is clear evidence that a breach has occurred, we do not hesitate to take action.\" Last week, following an in-depth investigation, the CMA ruled that the takeover of Footasylum by JD Sports could lead to a \"worse deal\" for customers and it would have to sell the chain. But JD Sports hit back, calling the decision \"inexplicable\" and \"beyond logic\". Mr Cowgill suggested that the CMA was in \"a minority of one in reaching this conclusion\". ",

            "content": "The ice rinks are opening, the decorations are going up and the Thanksgiving day parade will be back in its full glory this year. New York is getting ready to embrace tourists with open arms after 20 months of a strictly long-distance relationship. But visitors are also being warned that prices will be higher, menus more limited, even the toilet paper may not be as soft as you'd like. Welcome to travel in the wake of Covid. What are the rules for travelling to the US now? Before Covid, 65 million tourists were rolling into town every year, more than a million from the UK. With the ban on visitors from overseas now lifted - as long as they are vaccinated - businesses across New York are gearing up for what they hope will be a tsunami of tourists this winter. But behind the scenes things are still far from normal. \"Cutlery, plateware, glassware, take-out containers, paper products… you name it, it's across the board, even toilet paper,\" says Philippe Massoud, listing the things that are difficult to get hold of thanks to supply chain challenges. He is chef and owner of Ilili, a Lebanese restaurant on 5th Avenue. At a certain standard of venue, things like matching tableware and the right specification of toilet tissue matter, says Mr Massoud. \"Sandpaper\" is not okay, he says. Like the UK, the US is suffering supply chain bottlenecks, sharply rising prices and staffing shortages that are hampering day-to-day business. \"New York's heart is beating hard and strong,\" says Mr Massoud, so he's sure tourists will still have the experience they're looking for, but for dining out, they should definitely book ahead. Ilili has already had to close at lunchtimes. Many of the staff who used to work tables while pursuing careers on Broadway have left the city and not yet returned. \"Everybody without exception is struggling to find staff,\" says Mr Massoud. And with the cost of food rising, he says he has no choice but to look at raising his prices too. Ilili is adapting to cope. But not everyone managed to. Just as in other cities around the world, the pandemic has forced hotels, nightclubs, restaurants, bars and sandwich shops out of business. But now new venues are beginning to open, including a vast new nightclub near Times Square. In fact it's a moment of reinvention, that New York is grasping with enthusiasm, according to Fred Dixon, head of NYC & Co the body responsible for promoting the city. He points to the outdoor dining structures lining much of the city's streets, providing ventilated, safer spaces to dine. After Covid ripped mercilessly through the city at the start of the pandemic, New Yorkers remain cautious. People wear masks not only on public transport and in shops, but often on the street too. Proof of vaccination is required to dine indoors at restaurants in New York, attend sports events and theatres, a rule that applies to tourists too. \"There are challenges ahead of us but some of those innovations have kept New York lively and vibrant,\" says Mr Dixon. From the time the first lockdown his organisation determined to keep NYC alive in the minds of would-be travellers stuck at home in lockdown. It ran a \"New York is missing you\" billboard campaign in the UK, to remind them what they were missing. Now with museums open, rules relaxed and Broadway set to return to full capacity by spring, NYC &Co is switching messages to \"New York is ready for you\". But being ready is harder work than it used to be and visitors may have to exercise some patience, says Wilson Tang, who runs the 100 year old Nom Wah Tea Parlor, in New York's Chinatown district. Before the pandemic Chinatown attracted hoards of tourists, picking up trinkets, noodles and dumplings. And it was hit earlier and harder than most, thanks in part to rhetoric around \"the China virus\" and the xenophobia that followed. Now there are challenges to getting back to normal that can't be overcome overnight, Wilson says. \"The wait [for service] might be longer, we might not have the full menu, the pricing might be more expensive than the last time you were here,\" he warns. \"These are things to take account of as we awake from our Covid slumber.\" Nearby Lizy Yee, who runs the Kam Hing Bakery has managed to keep the price of her sponge cakes low for now, but is frantically stockpiling ingredients to head off rising costs. \"We're trying to get three to four months of reserve,\" she says. \"We're using basements, renting out storage rooms.\" She has already bought fifty 50lb bags of sugar and wants to bulk buy flour and flavourings too. The hunt for alternative suppliers and better deals is ongoing. At the luxury end of the market, they're taking a similar strategy. Rebecca Hubbard general manager of the five star Lotte New York Palace Hotel says she's \"elated\" at the prospect of returning tourists, but like others she's not taking chances. The hotel is making sure it is more than fully stocked with anything that might run short, if supply chain bottlenecks continue. \"We're preparing for the worst, continuing to keep our [stock] levels up just in case,\" Ms Hubbard says. \"Shampoo, toilet paper, linen, paper products, glassware anything guests would normally use in a room.\" On top of that the hotel needs a ready supply of masks. They are one of things that have run short in the past, and are susceptible to shipping delays as they're still mainly sourced from Asia. Mitchell Hochberg, president of Lightstone the property company that owns the Moxy chain of hotels says for the moment supply chain problems seem to be getting worse not better, though he insists that won't affect visitors' experience. \"A guest wouldn't know it's a different shampoo or that the air con unit part was bought from a different manufacturer,\" he says. But there are some changes. \"We instituted self-service check-in... like in an airport,\" says Mr Hochberg. \"It was well-received and seems to be something that will continue for simplicity.\" Moxy Hotels are offering guests the option to have less frequent room-cleaning, every three days rather than daily, if they prefer, for health and safety reasons, not to have staff coming into their room as often. And for now breakfast is still a takeaway bag of muffin, croissant, yoghurt and the like, rather than a hot buffet, also for Covid-safety reasons, he says. Having to find ways round the challenges has its upsides though too. At Midtown Manhattan wine bar Ardesia, it has proved a blessing in disguise. Mandy Oser, has found an order of white wine from Hungary is stuck in a port in Germany, a favourite Irish whiskey brand won't be available again until Christmas, and George Clooney's Casamigos Tequila is nowhere to be found. So she has been forced to find alternatives. Amongst her new discoveries are an \"outstanding\" new artisan tequila and a brand of bourbon made by an African-American owned company in Tennessee. \"For us it's opened up some new channels and pushed us to look rather than just reorder what we ordered a year ago. \"Covid taught us you do not know what is around the corner. We're trying to hold on to that.\" ",

            "content": "The UK could cut its total electricity usage by 1% if the top five British supermarkets put doors on fridges, campaigners have said. Aldi has pledged to put fridge doors in all of its new UK stores, saving 2,000 tonnes of carbon a year. Other supermarkets say they will try to make open fridges more efficient. But the Environmental Investigation Agency said supermarkets could cut their electricity bills by an average of 33% by adding doors. Each of Aldi's 100 new stores will save 20 tonnes of carbon per year by having doors on fridges, the German chain said, adding it would reduce stores' energy consumption by 20%. The best climate solution you've never heard of\nSolar fridge firm set for role in Covid-19 fight\nWhy supermarket chiller aisles may soon not be so chilly Glamorgan Cricketer and environmental campaigner Joe Cooke says all supermarkets operating in Wales should follow suit. \"It's such a simple change,\" Cooke said. \"It could save so much energy, that's going to be so important for us as we try to decarbonise and make the changes to become a greener country.\" Cooke said only the Co-op and Aldi had committed to fridge doors in all their new and newly refurbished stores. Mary Dunn, Aldi UK's managing director of corporate responsibility, said: \"Introducing fridge doors is another step on that journey to reduce our energy consumption and we hope that customers enjoy the new, more sustainable shopping experience.\" But Tesco, Sainsbury's, Morrisons, Waitrose and M&S all said they would be using \"air wall\" technologies that force cold air towards the back of open displays to save energy. Lidl said is uses curtains when its stores are closed and Asda said it would be trialling doors on chilled displays in 2022. Ulla Lindberg, a refrigeration and consumer researcher from Swedish fridge maker Haglund Industry, said fridges with doors outperform even the most efficient open cabinet technology. Ms Lindberg's research found food shoppers were not turned off by doors, with many feeling the food was fresher. Supermarkets with fridge doors also saw less food waste and allowed supermarkets to cut their heating bills in winter because they need less heat in the chilled sections of their stores, Ms Lindberg said. \"Half of the energy in a supermarket is from the refrigeration so that means that you cut a lot [with doors],\" she explained. \"You can also improve the situation for the consumer and the food as well.\" The then Welsh Assembly's petitions committee considered a campaign to ban open refrigerators in supermarkets in 2019, but members concluded the Welsh government did not have the powers to intervene. The UK government ruled out a ban on the use of open fridges and freezers in retail outlets in 2019 and said it was already taking action to improve energy efficiency. In a statement, the the Department for Business, Energy and Industrial Strategy said it was \"looking at various ways to encourage greater energy efficiency in commercial refrigeration\". \"We urge retailers to increase their use of energy-efficient technology wherever possible,\" it added.

            "content": "US employers hired more new workers in October than expected, after a slowdown in the summer. Firms added 531,000 jobs and the unemployment rate fell slightly to 4.6%, official figures showed. Hiring figures for September were also revised upwards. The spread of the Delta variant and slower growth had suppressed hiring over the summer, along with an apparent reluctance from parts of the workforce to return to work. That has left many employers scrambling for staff and struggling to meet growing demand. Many are raising wages to attract and retain staff. Figures from the Bureau for Labor Statistics showed average private sector wages rose modestly in October, by 11 cents, to $30.96 an hour, but the rise adds to six months of strong wage increases. The 4.9% growth in average earnings over the past year doesn't outpace annual inflation, which was running at 5.4% in September. Revised data for September showed that many more jobs were created that month, 312,000, than the 197,000 initially reported. Figures for August were also revised upwards from 366,000 to 483,000. There were notable gains in leisure and hospitality, in professional and business services, in manufacturing, and in transportation and warehousing, the Bureau said. Taken together the data shows a strong upward trend, although jobs growth is still below the rates seen in the first half of the year. by Michelle Fleury, BBC business correspondent President Biden used the October jobs report to take a victory lap, pointing out that the recovery had been faster and stronger than predicted. He said unemployment had decreased this year more than in any year since 1950. The solid jobs report signals that the economic fallout from the Delta wave is finally receding after several months of disappointing data. Nowhere was that more apparent than in the leisure and hospitality sector which added 164,000 jobs. And the gains weren't limited to one industry. Across the private sector hiring was strong, including in professional and business services, and manufacturing. But there is still a large hole to dig out of. The country has more than four million fewer jobs than it did before the pandemic And the labour force participation rate - which measures the share of people who have jobs or are actively looking for work - is flat even as the economic rebound gains steam. A large number of workers who left the American job market during the pandemic, don't seem to be in a hurry to return. And it's not clear that they will. Today's report shows the US economy is picking up momentum. But with lingering supply chain issues and the unpredictability of the health crisis, whether this performance can be repeated remains anyone's guess. Analysts welcomed the report as a strong indication of post-pandemic recovery. \"It shows that we're seeing the jobs market healing to the point where we could expect even larger gains next month as more people return to the labour force,\" said Peter Cardillo, chief market economist at Spartan Capital Securities in New York. However, the participation rate, which shows what proportion of potential workers are in jobs or looking for one, remained flat, suggesting not everyone is ready for a return to normal. \"The participation rate idled at 61.6% which is consistent with people being hesitant about returning to the workforce,\" said Joe Manimbo, senior market analyst at Western Union Business Solutions in Washington. \"The market wants to see people come off the sidelines and return to the labour force.\" Fear of Covid infection, childcare challenges, relocations and other lifestyle changes have kept some people out of the labour market. With government support coming to an end, children back in school and savings made during the pandemic running down economists expect more people to return to work. There are currently 7.4 million people out of work, down sharply from its peak during the pandemic but above the 5.7 million who were looking for work pre-Covid. In February 2020, before the pandemic the unemployment rate was 3.5%. Seema Shah, chief strategist at Principal Global Investors, said it was \"a little mystifying\" why more people were not returning to the workforce. \"At this point, with reduced benefits, a return to in-person schooling and the drop in Covid rates, we should be seeing a recovery in participation,\" she said. \"Is it because the massive cushion of savings is still weighing on the incentive to return to work? Or is there a fundamental shift in the psychology of working?\" Until more workers return \"supply chain issues will only linger\", she added. ",

            "content": "Women who collectively missed out on £1bn in underpaid state pensions should all receive their money by the end of 2023, but the target has been described as \"ambitious\" by a former minister. Analysis published by the Office for Budget Responsibility (OBR) confirms that the scandal was not as widespread as first feared. However, 135,000 people are still thought to have been affected. A major report said repeated human errors made for years were to blame. The problem relates to the \"old\" state pension system where married women who had a small pension in their own right could claim a 60% basic state pension based on their husband's record of contributions. A review is taking place to trace those affected by systemic failures to award these pension rises, stretching back to 1985. But only some women are being fully paid. Others will only be able to claim for 12 months of missed payments. Experts say £10,900 a year needed to retire\nTriple lock pension pledge suspended for one year In its economic analysis of the UK, published at the time of the Budget, the OBR confirmed data from the Department for Work and Pensions (DWP) showing that not as much state pension has to be paid to those who have missed out than was estimated in March. It said underpayments amounted to £1.06bn, rather than the £2.66bn estimated in March. Estimates of the total number of people affected have been cut from 199,753 to 135,339. Grandmother-of-four Irene Wise, from Worcestershire, spent two years battling for her money. The 74-year-old eventually received £7,334 in back payments for eight years of missed pensions. \"When you think you have been short-changed for that many years, what a difference [the money] could have made in certain circumstances,\" she said. Jan Tiernan, from Fife, is one of those affected by the wider problems caused by the errors. She too was initially told she was not owed any money. After nearly 100 pages of correspondence with the department, she received £1,280. However, she believes she is still owed more than £17,000 in missed payments. \"It makes me sad and angry. I've been on this campaign for two years now. It is not just for me but for all of these people who have been done out of this money. They should have got it,\" she said. Read more about their stories Crucially, the timetable for when people will received the correct entitlement has been shortened. There had been criticism that some would have to wait until 2026 for the money, despite already being elderly. Now the DWP believes all the money should be paid correctly by the end of 2023. Sir Steve Webb, partner at consultancy LCP and a former pensions minister, initially unearthed the problems and described the new timetable as \"ambitious\". \"To date, DWP has only paid around 6% of the estimated £1bn which is owed, even though this exercise has been going since January,\" he said. \"The department has less than half the 500 civil servants so far working on this project that they have said they will need. It will take a major effort to get this matter resolved in just over two years from now. But it is important that the timetable does not slip, not least given the age and vulnerability of those affected.\" In September, a report by the National Audit Office found that errors occurred because state pension rules were complex, computer systems were outdated and many tasks still needed to be done manually. It also found the DWP did not have a means of reviewing individual complaints or errors, such as how many people were complaining about the same issues, to assess whether the errors had a systemic cause. A spokesman for the DWP said: \"The action we are taking now is correcting the historical underpayments that have been made by successive governments and anyone impacted will be contacted by us to ensure they receive all that they are owed. \"Since we became aware of this issue, we have introduced new quality control processes and improved training to help ensure this does not happen again.\" ",

            "content": "Investors managing funds on behalf of former US Education Secretary Betsy DeVos and her family were given false information relating to scandal-hit healthcare firm Theranos, her representative has said. The DeVos family office invested $100m (£73m) in the now defunct company. The claims were made at the trial of Theranos founder Elizabeth Holmes. Ms Holmes is accused of lying to investors and patients about the company's blood-testing technology. Ms Devos family's investment arm is one of several high profile investors allegedly duped by the firm. Ms Holmes, 37, denies the claims. The former Silicon Valley star is charged with 12 counts of fraud and could face 20 years in jail if found guilty. The Devos family is one of America's richest, and Betsy Devos, a Republican, served as education secretary under Donald Trump. Lisa Peterson, a representative of the DeVos family's investment office, told the San Jose court on Tuesday that she had been asked to explore a potential investment in Theranos in 2014. She said the firm had provided her with detailed information, including that its tests were used by the US military and big pharmaceutical companies. The firm also allegedly said that its devices could conduct 300 blood tests before having to be replaced, and that the company did all of its testing on its own lab machines, not third party equipment. Theranos: Elizabeth Holmes took US general's blood\nElizabeth Holmes: The boss accused of duping Silicon Valley According to the US Attorney's Office, which is prosecuting Ms Holmes, those claims were false and were deployed to fraudulently raise $700m from powerful investors. Ms Peterson told the court that the DeVos family had originally intended to invest $50m in Theranos, but doubled the amount after meeting Ms Holmes, who convinced them the technology was a \"game changer for healthcare\". Ms Holmes' defence lawyer, Lance Wade, suggested the DeVos family had not done proper due diligence, to which Ms Peterson replied: \"We didn't think we needed it.\" Mr Holmes' trial began in September and is likely to last until December. The trial so far has also heard: Ms Holmes allegedly faked \"independent due diligence reports\" from pharmaceutical companies Pfizer and Schering-Plough, which backed the viability of her technology\nWade Miquelon, the former chief financial officer of pharmacy chain Walgreens, testified that the company was impressed by this research and went on to partner with Theranos and invest $140m\nFormer Safeway boss Steve Burd said his company spent 100 hours doing due diligence on Theranos before agreeing to a partnership deal in 2010\nSunil Dhawan, who served as Theranos' lab director in 2014-2015, testified that he had only been to the firm's labs a handful of times and rarely interacted with its technicians. Once dubbed the \"next Steve Jobs\", Ms Holmes rose to fame in 2013 thanks to technology she claimed could test for multiple diseases using just a few drops of blood from a finger prick. But in 2015 a whistleblower revealed the tests did not work, and the billionaire inventor fell from grace. In 2016 she was banned from running a blood testing firm for two years, and by 2018 Theranos had been dissolved. Ms Holmes and Ramesh \"Sunny\" Balwani - her former business partner and boyfriend - were charged with fraud shortly after that. Ms Holmes' lawyers say she did not intend to defraud, but instead \"naively underestimated\" the challenges her business faced. They also allege Mr Balwani abused her emotionally and psychologically for years, impairing her mental state. Mr Balwani denies the allegations. At the start of the trial in September, Mr Wade said: \"By the time this trial is over, you will see that the villain the government just presented is actually a living, breathing human being who did her very best each and every day. And she is innocent.\" ",

            "content": "The United States government has offered a bounty of up to $10million (£7.4m) for information about the hacking group known as DarkSide. In May, a DarkSide ransomware attack shut down a vital 5,500-mile-long fuel pipeline on the east coast of the US. The pipeline carries 45% of the fuel used on the east coast. The bounty is offered for information which can lead to the \"identification or location of any individuals\" in a leadership position with DarkSide. What is ransomware? A separate $5m reward has been offered for information leading to the arrest of anybody \"conspiring to participate\" in a DarkSide ransomware attack. The cyber-attack caused fuel shortages after the Colonial Pipeline company shut down its operations for several days. It eventually paid the $4.4m ransom in Bitcoin. The BBC is not responsible for the content of external sites.\nView original tweet on Twitter Crypto-currency analysis company Elliptic estimated that DarkSide had received at least $90m in ransom payments from 47 victims. However, US authorities later said 63.7 Bitcoin, the majority of the ransom paid by Colonial Pipeline, had been recovered. $10m is the largest bounty ever offered for the arrest of a specific cyber-criminal. The ignominious record was previously held by Maksim Yakubets, the alleged mastermind behind another ransomware gang called Evil Corp. The US named and shamed him (along with help from the UK authorities) in 2019. Before that, the record bounty stood at $3m for another alleged cyber-crime boss called Evgeniy Bogachev. The thing these individuals have in common? They are thought to be living care-free lives in Russia safe from any prospect of arrest from the local police, who routinely ignore western accusations against Russian hackers. Even with their names, pictures and a rough location published by the US, these alleged criminals are safe. The US seems to have even less to go on in terms of unmasking DarkSide's leaders, although most research suggests they are also in Russia. So, despite the eye-watering sums being offered by the US, the chances of these criminals facing justice are slim. ",

Temporary measures such as the cut to Stamp Duty had also helped to lift prices, along with an influx of first-time buyers supported by parental deposits, he added. In regional terms, Wales remained the strongest performing area, the Halifax said, with annual house price inflation of 12.9% and an average house price of £198,880. In England, the North West has returned to being the strongest performing region. Prices rose by 10.4% over the 12 months, with the average house costing £205,881. Average house prices in London are still far higher than elsewhere in the country at £514,907. However, the capital saw the UK's lowest house price growth of just 0.8%. Earlier this week, rival lender the Nationwide said its research showed the price of a typical UK home was now £250,311 after prices rose by 9.9% in the last year. The building society said prices rose 0.7% in October compared with the previous month. The limited supply of housing being put up for sale has hit online estate agent Purplebricks, which cut its earnings outlook on Thursday because fewer properties were being added to its platform. It said it expected instructions from its clients to sell or rent out properties to have fallen by 38% to 22,000 in the six months to the end of October, as compared with a year earlier. ",

Bennetts, in Derby - which opened as an ironmongers in 1734 - was bought out of administration by local businessman Paul Hurst. Mr Hurst said he was hoping to reopen a series of smaller stores, with the first one launching later. He said: \"It's great to be back on the high street again.\" The shop, branded as Seasons by Bennetts, is due to open on Sadler Gate, in Derby's historical cathedral quarter, close to its former Irongate home. Mr Hurst said he hoped the Irongate store would reopen but the level of works required for the listed building had slowed progress. \"We are still totally committed to the Irongate store,\" he said. \"With it being our flagship, we want it to be something really special and we hope to be releasing more information on that in the near future. \"In the meantime, the Sadler Gate store looks amazing.\" Follow BBC East Midlands on Facebook, Twitter, or Instagram.

            "content": "Customers are Christmas shopping early, retailer Marks & Spencer has said, with nearly half expecting to have finished buying gifts by the end of November. Rival John Lewis said that many people were planning big family get-togethers after lockdowns last Christmas. Retail expert Steve Dresser said people were \"spooked about shortages of stock\" and were budgeting in tough times. In October, shop footfall was higher than in September, British Retail Consortium (BRC) data suggested. Marks & Spencer said that many customers were shopping early and planning ahead, while nearly 40% were planning to do more to celebrate Christmas than prior to Covid. More than two thirds (68%) were planning to have a big family Christmas, the retailer added. A spokeswoman for John Lewis Group, which includes Waitrose, said customers were \"making plans and getting ready earlier than normal\". She said that \"after last year\" customers were \"keen to enjoy the festivities as much as possible this year\". Last Christmas there were lockdown restrictions on gatherings, with people in London and Southeast England - the country's most populous region - only allowed to celebrate with their household and support bubbles. Both M&S and John Lewis have launched their Christmas adverts slightly earlier than last year to try to entice people to buy from them. Steve Dresser, managing director of Grocery Insight, said that people were buying early due to uncertainty. This included being \"spooked\" by shortages of stock. He said household finances were being squeezed by inflation including higher fuel and energy prices, and \"shopping early is one way to spread the cost of Christmas\". Mr Dresser said that there was uncertainty as to whether coronavirus restrictions, which last year closed non-essential retail in London and the South East at short notice, would be brought back again. He added there was a chance that stock \"that lands very late in the season\" could mean \"that large mark-downs will have to be applied, almost reducing it as it goes on the shelf\", which would be \"bad news\" for retailers. Consumer confidence took a turn for the worse in October, according to research firm GfK. People were concerned about the future of the UK economy \"against a backdrop of cheerless domestic news\" including \"fuel and food shortages\" and \"surging inflation squeezing household budgets\", Joe Staton, client strategy director GfK, said. Retailers have \"brought forward Christmas range launches to help smooth out supply chain bumps ahead of the peak trading period\", said Sensormatic Solutions retail consultant Andy Sumpter. Stores have been dealing with supply chain disruption that has been causing shortages of products from cars to turkeys. People have been going to shops more compared with September, in part to do early Christmas shopping, Mr Sumpter said. Shipping boss: 'Christmas will be safe' from shortages\nShortage problem: What's the UK running low on and why? In October, footfall in shops was up 3.2% compared with the previous month, and UK footfall was ahead of Spain, Germany, Italy and France, according to BRC data. But despite that October rise, footfall in shops is still substantially lower than pre-pandemic levels. Footfall was down much less in north-west England, which saw an 8.7% fall, compared with London, where footfall was down 21.4% compared with 2019. In total, across the UK, footfall in shops in October was down 13.7% compared with two years ago. This drop has been somewhat balanced out by the rise in online shopping, although online buying has declined since a peak in the Covid pandemic, a BRC spokeswoman said. In central London retailers have forecast that festive spending will hit £1.2bn, which is a third up on last year, but still half of 2019's pre-pandemic levels. Crucially, though, trading rates are down by more than half, and \"West End retailers are facing a challenging festive period due to the continued absence of high spending international travellers\", the New West End Company said. The company, which represents 600 retail, restaurant, hotel and property owners in Bond Street, Oxford Street, Regent Street and Mayfair, called for the government to bring back tax-free shopping for non-EU visitors, which was scrapped after the Brexit transition period ended on 31 December 2020. Since those tax-free sales were ended, places such as Paris and Milan \"have benefited from a 20% price advantage over the UK - a situation the West End desperately wants re-examined - pushing the UK further down the travel wish-list of festive holidaymakers, particularly high spenders from non-EU countries\", the company said.

            "header": "Bank of England hints at future interest rate rise",
            "content": "The Bank of England has signalled it will raise interest rates in \"coming months\" in response to high inflation, but held off on an immediate increase. On Thursday, Bank policymakers voted 7-2 in favour of no change from the current record low rate of 0.1%. Bank governor Andrew Bailey said the decision had been a \"close call\". The Monetary Policy Committee (MPC) said there was \"value\" in waiting to see how the jobs market coped with the end of the furlough scheme. However, it did not rule out a rate rise at its next meeting in December. The MPC meets every six weeks. When pressed on when a rate rise might come, Mr Bailey said: \"From now onwards.\" He said the MPC had \"spent many hours\" pondering its decision, adding: \"The calls are close, they are quite hard. It's a reflection of the position we're in.\" In a BBC interview, Mr Bailey said current conditions were different because inflation was being caused by global \"supply shocks\" rather than demand pressure in the UK economy. \"Putting interest rates up, I'm afraid, isn't going to get us more gas,\" he added. But he said that interest rates were not going to return to levels seen before the 2008 financial crisis. \"For the foreseeable future, we're in a world of low interest rates,\" he said. \"That doesn't mean that they don't rise and fall within that sort of bound. But I want to be quite clear, we're not signalling that there's going to be some very sharp return to the world that we can just about remember before the financial crisis.\" Mr Bailey said the MPC wanted to see \"more evidence\" of how the labour market was evolving before raising interest rates. However, he stressed: \"We think there will be some need to increase interest rates to bring inflation sustainably back to target. And we will be ready to do that.\" How do interest rates affect your money?\nWhy is the cost of living going up? While the MPC voted to keep interest rates on hold, policymakers were split on the decision. Two of the nine members, Dave Ramsden and Michael Saunders, voted to raise rates immediately to 0.25%. Rates were cut to their current level in March last year in response to the effects of the coronavirus pandemic. But the reopening of the economy has fuelled price rises, prompting expectations that the Bank would increase borrowing costs. The pound fell by nearly 1% against the dollar to $1.3556 following the Bank's decision, reflecting the fact that investors had bet on a rate rise. Financial markets expect the interest rate to hit 1% by the end of next year. Electricity and gas prices have surged as the global economy reopens. Factories and businesses are also struggling with staff shortages and a backlog of orders, which has also pushed up prices. The Bank expects inflation to peak at 5% next April, up from 3.1% in September. This would be the highest rate in more than a decade and far higher than the Bank's target of 2%. The Bank said households faced \"substantially\" higher energy bills next year. Policymakers also said food prices were likely to rise in the run-up to Christmas. However, they added that the sharp increase in inflation was expected to be \"temporary\", with price rises expected to ease back towards 2% in the second half of next year. Higher inflation is expected to put pressure on household finances for the next two years. The Bank's latest Monetary Policy Report expects price rises to outpace pay increases in 2022 and 2023. So-called real incomes are expected to barely grow in 2024. High Street banks use the interest rate set by the Bank's MPC to set their own mortgages and savings rates. While an increase in interest rates would have been bad news for borrowers, many mortgage holders would not have faced an immediate increase in payments. Three quarters of mortgage holders are currently on fixed-rate deals. Higher prices are expected to weigh on growth in the near term. The Bank now expects the economy to grow by 1.5% in the three months to September. This is almost half the rate expected at its previous forecast in August. As a result, the economy is not expected to get back to its pre-pandemic size until the start of next year. It had previously expected the economy to recover by the end of 2021. The Bank also cut its forecast for annual growth in 2021 and 2022 to 7% and 5% respectively, down from 7.25% and 6% previously. In September, around a million workers were still on the government's furlough scheme that subsidised wages. The scheme ended in October and the Bank expects most of those who were on furlough to return to work. While the peak in inflation next April is expected at a time when around 40% of workers are negotiating pay deals, the Bank does not expect higher prices to lead to big demands for pay rises. It suggested that many workers were still scarred by the financial crisis, when many accepted slow pay growth or wage freezes even amid rising inflation. Be in no doubt, people and businesses should prepare for rates rising in the coming months, perhaps as high as 1% from their record lows of 0.1%, but not precisely this month. The message from the Bank of England is that the economy has been hit by supply chain bottlenecks, both for goods and workers, pushing back the time when the economy regains all the lost pandemic growth into early next year. And while the inflation picture is now worse, with a forecast peak of 5% when the energy price cap is due to be further increased in April 2022, there is not much the Bank thinks it can do about the global drivers of this. Where the Bank can act is around the persistence of this inflation into 2023 and 2024. They do now feel there is a risk that pressures from rising prices last. If interest rates were kept at these emergency lows, the Bank forecasts inflation would still be about 3% in late 2024. But acting now would have required immediate evidence of a spiral in wage rises across the economy. On balance, the members of the Bank of England's Monetary Policy Committee want to see official data in a fortnight on the impact of the end of the furlough scheme on the jobs market. ",

            "content": "Game publisher Electronic Arts (EA) has told investors that collectible NFTs are \"an important part of the future of our industry\". NFTs have erupted in popularity in recent months as a way to buy and sell digital-only art and collectible items. EA makes the Fifa football series, which uses \"card packs\" to \"collect\" players in its Ultimate Team mode. Chief executive Andrew Wilson told investors he believes Fifa players want to see NFTs in the franchise. \"[Players] want more modalities at play inside the game, which go beyond just straight 11-on-11 football,\" he told an earnings call. \"They want more digital experiences outside the game - esports, NFTs, broader sports consumption and they want us to move really, really quickly.\" What are NFTs and why are some worth millions?\nNFT-based fantasy football cards raise $680m But he also said that NFT ideas were \"still really, really early\" and came with a \"a lot of hype\". \"It's still early to kind of figure out how that's going to work,\" he warned. Bringing NFTs into gaming is sometimes presented as an idea called \"play to earn\", based around the idea that unique digital items can increase in value over time - and be sold off later for profit. PC Gamer reports that recent job listings at EA have included references to NFTs and the underlying technology they run on, the blockchain. But the idea is controversial among gamers. Major PC gaming platform Steam has banned blockchain and NFT-based games from its platform, while its rival Epic has not. Some game designers believe the concept is bad for gaming overall, but other studios - including major player Ubisoft - are apparently embracing the idea. 'The kids emptied our bank account playing Fifa'\nIs this the end for the Fifa video game series? Games industry analyst Piers Harding-Rolls from Ampere said NFT and blockchain games \"are new disruptive forces within the games sector\". He said all major publishers would be looking at the potential of these formats to make money - and \"EA is no exception\". \"It would be bad commercial practice not to be analysing how these technologies could impact its existing business,\" he said. What are the fan tokens given to Messi by PSG?\nTwelve-year-old boy makes £290,000 from whale NFTs\nOpenSea admits insider trading of NFTs NFTs are already seeing use in the sports collectables market, he added: \"I see a strong fit between [Fifa's card-based] Ultimate Team and the use of NFTs, but there are implications that need to be considered - not least the ongoing value and utility of NFTs, especially in the context of the season renewal which drives most activity within this mode of the game.\" On the earnings call, Mr Wilson seemed to echo that seasonal sentiment - in which sports games such as FIFA are released annually and reflect the current sports calendar. \"Collectability in games like Fifa and Madden and NHL, is really built on driving value through the traditional sports season,\" he said. \"Is there an opportunity, particularly as we think about NFTs and other digital ecosystems to expand that value over time? I think the short answer to that is 'yes'. \"I mean the slightly longer answer to that is we need to work and make sure we continue to appropriately tune and balance the experience for our players… but we will continue, as we have evolved the Ultimate Team experience over the last decade, we will continue to look for ways to add value for our players.\" ",

Significant savings can be made over the lifetime of a machine - even with those that are initially dearer to buy, the consumer group, Which?, said. One £260 tumble dryer cost £135 a year to run - while a more efficient £800 dryer cost just £29 a year. But charities criticised a \"poverty premium\" preventing those on low incomes from making efficiency savings. Which? assessed tumble dryers, washing machines, fridge freezers, ovens and dishwashers using the current energy price cap.

In Which?'s lab testing, the Hoover cost £135 a year to run, while the Miele cost £29 a year - meaning that, assuming a 20-year lifespan of the dryer, those buying the Miele could save £1,580. The most efficient washing machine model tested, the Ebac AWM74D2H, cost £15 a year in energy costs, while the least efficient model chosen, the Haier HW100-B14876, cost £70 annually. Assuming a 16-year lifespan, the savings on running costs between them could be more than £800 - without factoring in the slightly higher purchase price. The findings also suggested a potential to save more than £100 a year by opting for the most energy-efficient fridge freezer tested. Which? said its own data suggested white goods in the study had expected lifespans of between 16 and 23 years, and it said consumers should consider a switch when their old white goods needed replacing. Charities said the luxury of buying the most efficient appliances - often more expensive - was likely to be beyond the reach of those on low incomes. \"Many people simply don't have the money available to pay initially higher prices for better, more efficient appliances, meaning they pay much more in the long run,\" David Steele, from The Money Charity, told the BBC. Fair By Design, which campaigns against what it describes as \"the extra costs of being poor\", said affordable price protections were needed so poorer people were not \"hit by a double whammy of high running costs\". Debt advice charity StepChange described a \"poverty premium\", saying people often went into debt after unforeseen expenditure on things such as replacing broken white goods. It suggested zero-interest loans should be more widely available. Responding to Which?, Hoover promoted its more efficient heat pump appliances, saying it continued to invest in development.

            "content": "JD Sports has hit out at the UK's competition watchdog after being forced to sell rival chain Footasylum. After an investigation, the Competition and Markets Authority (CMA) ruled that the takeover could lead to a \"worse deal\" for customers. But JD Sports criticised the move, calling the decision \"inexplicable\" and \"beyond logic\". Its chairman Peter Cowgill suggested that the CMA is in \"a minority of one in reaching this conclusion\". The CMA found that JD Sports was the closest alternative for Footasylum shoppers. However, the retailer has argued that one of the key areas of competition it faces is from brands such as Nike and Adidas selling their goods direct to consumers online. JD Sports' chairman Peter Cowgill noted that the CMA had acknowledged that these direct sales were a threat to the retailer, which, he said, made the competition body's decision puzzling. JD Sports boss rejects criticism of £4.3m bonus\nBrexit worse than feared, says JD Sports boss The deal to buy Footasylum was first announced in April 2019. The latest ruling by the CMA follows an in-depth investigation after the competition watchdog first blocked the £90m takeover last year. JD Sports appealed against a ruling by the CMA in September, saying it was \"perplexed\" by its decision not to include online sales to consumers by major brands. In an update on Thursday, the CMA found that the takeover of Footasylum would reduce competition even after taking into account the growth in online shopping. Half of 1,300 online shoppers surveyed by the competition watchdog said that they would go to JD Sports if they were unable to purchase their usual trainers or joggers at Footasylum. It suggested that customers would have fewer options and could face higher prices, fewer discounts, and less choice of products in-store as a result. Kip Meek, chair of the CMA inquiry group, said: \"The UK boasts a thriving sports fashion market and today's decision reflects our commitment to keeping it that way. \"We strongly believe shoppers could suffer if Footasylum stopped having to compete with JD Sports. It is likely they would pay more for less choice, worse service and lower quality.\" It added that the rivals can continue to compete for shoppers online and as they return to the High Street. JD Sports argued on Thursday that the CMA in fact agreed with it on several fronts. It said, for example, that the CMA had found JD Sports' biggest competition came from international brands selling to consumers from their own websites or apps. JD Sports also said that it would have no incentive to raise prices or reduce deals for shoppers. In a statement to investors, JD Sports said that \"the decision to prohibit the acquisition defies logic\", given that Footasylum has a market share of less than 5%. \"The CMA rightly concludes that, following the acquisition of Footasylum, JD would have no incentive to raise prices or worsen its offer as its most important competitors are the [Direct to Consumer] DTC operations of the international brands themselves,\" said Mr Cowgill. \"However, the CMA has then somehow concluded that the competitive threat from DTC does not extend to Footasylum and that JD would have an incentive to worsen the offer in Footasylum to the detriment of both consumers and suppliers. We would suggest that the CMA is in a minority of one in reaching this conclusion. \"Overall, the CMA's decision today continues to be inexplicable to anyone who understands what difference the pandemic has made to UK retail and how competition and the supply chain in our markets actually work.\" Mr Cowgill added that the decision comes after the UK High Street has been seriously damaged by coronavirus-related lockdowns and could see further closures. The sportswear retailer has four weeks to lodge an appeal with the Competition Appeal Tribunal following the decision. JD said that it is studying the CMA's new report in detail and will consider its options \"carefully\". Despite the watchdog's decision, JD's share price rose by more than 3% on Thursday to £11.17. Susannah Streeter, senior investment and markets analyst at Hargreaves Lansdown, said that investors appeared to have \"shrugged off\" the news. \"The acquisition was part of the company's quest for dominance in the sportswear market,\" she said. \"But the decision by the CMA on the grounds that keeping Footasylum within the group would lead to a lack of choice for customers, indicates just how formidable JD Sports now is as an online powerhouse.\" ",

            "content": "All eyes are on Bank of England policymakers on Thursday as they face pressure to lift interest rates in response to rising inflation. Many analysts have predicted that rates will rise to 0.25% when the decision is announced at lunchtime. The UK's main interest rate, set by the Bank's Monetary Policy Committee (MPC), has been at an all-time low of 0.1% since the pandemic began. But prices have been rising sharply since the economy reopened. The Bank itself has acknowledged that inflation could peak at 4% or even 5% before cooling again - far above its 2% target. Charlie Bean, a former deputy governor of the Bank who is now a senior member of the Office for Budget Responsibility, told the BBC that the fiscal watchdog expects interest rates to reach the pre-Covid level of 0.75% within the next 18 months. \"Interest rates really have been very low during the pandemic,\" he said. \"So it is reasonable to expect to see some movement up.\" He added: \"The question for the Bank is, do they move this month?\" Torsten Bell, chief executive of the Resolution Foundation think tank, said the decision was \"finely balanced\", because the economic recovery was \"showing signs of weakening\", while price rises were largely down to global factors and outside the Bank's control. With record low interest rates, borrowing money in the UK is currently as cheap as it ever was. Now, however, the tide is turning and that era of ultra-cheap money could be coming to an end. If the Bank does lift interest rates, many people with a mortgage will face higher repayments, since lenders will seek to increase their rates in line with the Bank's decision. However, savers will be hoping for a better return on their money. The main point of making it more expensive to borrow money is to curb inflation - the rate at which prices are rising. As the UK economy recovers from the impact of Covid, consumers have more money to spend. That pent-up demand is pushing up the cost of a whole range of goods, some of which are in short supply because of the way in which factors such as the pandemic and Brexit have disrupted supply chains. That's bad news for the Bank, which has a mandate to keep the annual rate of inflation at 2%. If it goes as high as 3% or as low as 1%, the Bank's governor, Andrew Bailey, has to write a letter to Chancellor Rishi Sunak to explain why and what he is going to do about it. We are already in that territory, since inflation is currently at 3.1%. And the Bank expects it to rise still further. Why is the cost of living going up?\nHow would an interest rate rise affect you? If the Bank puts interest rates up, the effect is to persuade people not to borrow and spend. Instead, consumers will tend to save, because returns from savings are higher. With less disposable income being spent, the economy slows and inflation goes down again. That's the theory, at least. Interest rates can be a bit of a blunt instrument. If they go up too far and too fast, that can choke off economic recovery and even cause a recession. The Bank has been sitting on its hands in recent months, taking the view that the burst of inflation will be short-lived and will fix itself without the need for intervention. And to be fair, other countries are seeing a similar price surge, yet neither the US Federal Reserve nor the European Central Bank has so far stepped in to raise rates. But markets now expect the UK's main interest rate to rise - and those expectations are already having a direct impact on the mortgage market, with borrowers trying to lock in a low rate on five-year fixed deals while they still can, while some of the best deals are already disappearing. Mortgage experts say they are expecting a \"slow and measured\" increase in the cost of home loans. Some 74% of mortgage holders are on fixed-rate deals, so would only see a change in their repayments when their current term ends\nOf the remainder, 850,000 homeowners are on tracker deals, which usually move in line with Bank rate changes\nThe other 1.1 million are on standard variable rates (SVR), often because they have been automatically moved at the end of their fixed-deal term. The rate of interest they pay can be changed at any time by their lender, as is often the case if the Bank rate is altered\nWere there to be a 0.25 percentage point rise in rates, this would translate to approximately an additional £26-a-month mortgage payment on average for a tracker rate customer and £16 for the typical borrower on an SVR Source: UK Finance There are nine people on the Bank's MPC, so at least five of them need to be in favour of putting up rates. Analysts reckon that those voting for an increase will include the governor, Mr Bailey, who has said the Bank \"will have to act\" over rising inflation. The Bank's new chief economist, Huw Pill, has declined to say how he will vote, but he has said the Bank is in a \"very uncomfortable place\" and that the decision on Thursday is \"finely balanced\". If rates do not go up this time, the MPC will have other chances at its next two meetings in December and February. Markets seem convinced that there will be at least one rate increase by then. Those whose memories stretch back as far as the 1970s will be uncomfortably aware of the dangers posed by out-of-control inflation. Price rises reached their peak in 1975, hitting a rate of 22.6%, as the cost of oil tripled and sent petrol prices rocketing. But in those days, powerful trade unions were able to demand and receive higher wages to match those price increases. This, it has been argued, pushed prices up further, causing an inflationary spiral. No-one is seriously suggesting that those days are set to return. But they do serve as a reminder of why central banks around the world were given a mandate to seek price stability in the first place. If the Bank of England cannot demonstrate its ability to get a grip on rising prices, it could face questions about how well it is doing its basic job. ",

Businesses have been struggling with supply chain problems as economies recover from the Covid pandemic. The Swedish furniture giant saw record demand during the pandemic as people spent more time at home. However, pre-tax profit at Ikea Group, which makes most of its money selling goods to its franchisees, fell 16% in the year to September to €1.7bn (£1.4bn). Compared with 2019, before the pandemic, profit was down 4%.

Ikea didn't hike its product prices to retailers in the year to September but indicated it would pass on some of the higher raw material and transport costs to store owners this fiscal year. \"Though we can't continue to secure fixed prices to the retailers under these challenging conditions, we also plan to absorb part of the increased costs during FY22,\" it said. Mr Van Dam said store owners would have some freedom to decide whether, or to what extent, they would pass on higher prices to shoppers. The Ikea announcement comes after chief executive Jesper Brodin said in mid-October that congestion at ports had led to supply problems. \"We need to live with disturbances for the year to come,\" he said.

Sital Raja-Arjan, who runs a Hindu one-stop store in Bolton, relies on deliveries from India, but said she was now getting one a week, as opposed to the four she received pre-pandemic. In October, the government introduced temporary visas for 5,000 lorry drivers amid concerns over deliveries. Ms Raja-Arjan's store House of Raja's sells everything for the festivities, from brightly coloured and heavily embroidered silk saris to candles, curries and sweets. She said the reduction in deliveries had led to her losing 50% of her business, as many of her customers would have already bought new dresses for Navratri, a nine-day festival which precedes Diwali. \"Goods weren't here on time, so come Diwali, I'll be left with a lot of surplus stock,\" she said. \"We usually get 6,000 to 7,000 packets of halwa [a sweet dish], we've been lucky to get 900. \"We've had to be very tight.\" She said it was not possible to get many of the goods she sells locally, but the delivery problems had taken her by surprise. \"When you've done the same process for 30 years and suddenly that process is taken away... we never had a plan B, because we never knew we'd get Covid,\" she said.

She added that despite the problems, most people were still looking forward to the festival after not being able to see loved ones due to the pandemic. \"This year, it'll be extra special, because you'll be able to see them,\" she added. \"I've lost family members, friends, colleagues and university friends. \"It's been hard, but there are better days ahead.\" Why not follow BBC North West on Facebook, Twitter and Instagram?

It says its \"Mesh\" platform will let people meet in the virtual space, with or without a virtual reality headset. Microsoft says the new features, which it is calling \"immersive meetings\" will be available in the first half of 2022. It comes after Facebook showcased similar virtual chat rooms as part of its rebrand to name itself Meta. While there is no single strict definition of what a \"metaverse\" will be, most versions envision a future version of the internet with a diverse range of interconnected virtual worlds, covering everything from gaming to education. Both Microsoft and Meta are pitching 3D chat and collaboration, as a key part of their initial pitch. Teams is Microsoft's business chat and video call app, similar to Zoom or Google Meet, and a version is also available for personal users. Apparently, it's the next big thing. What is the metaverse?\nFacebook changes its name to Meta in major rebrand Microsoft, however, is focusing less on the need for a virtual reality (VR) or augmented reality (AR) headset, though it will support them. The 3D avatars, for example, will be able to represent a person in a remote Teams meeting when they do not want to turn on their webcam, and can appear on a normal two-dimensional computer screen. The company said its system will \"use AI to imitate movements and gestures that enable you to bring your physical presence into the conversation, even when your camera is off\". \"Too many people, too much of the time, are a static picture or bubble with initials,\" wrote Microsoft's John Roach in a blog post. The avatars will also be able to animate the movement of a mouth when a microphone picks up the user speaking, to \"bring additional expressivity\", he said. Companies and organisations will be able to create their own 3D spaces for meetings to their own designs, which will also work in 2D or 3D. For those who do own a suitable VR or AR headset, Microsoft plans to allow people to move around the virtual environments using the technology, but it is not required. It said the system had been tested out with thousands of new hires at consultancy firm Accenture, which has been using the system to \"onboard\" employees during the pandemic. Microsoft has its own AR technology wing, which makes a headset known as the Hololens. But, unlike Facebook's Oculus or Valve's Index VR gaming headsets, it is marketed towards business customers. It serves a different purpose, mixing digital overlays with real-world vision, and costs significantly more, with prices in the thousands of dollars. The company says its initial augmented reality push was designed to be used by 3D designers, collaborating on \"everything from bicycles and high-end furniture to new jet engines and sports stadiums\". It says that bringing the Mesh platform to Teams is a \"gateway to the metaverse\" and it believes that people who try out what it thinks is a more expressive, immersive space, will prefer it to the traditional way of remote meeting. Microsoft chief executive Satya Nadella, explaining the new systems at Microsoft's Ignite event, said: \"What's most important is that we are able to bring our humanity with us, and choose how we want to experience this world. \"The metaverse is not just transforming how we see the world, it's changing how all of us actively participate in it.\" ",

            "content": "Most big UK firms and financial institutions will be forced to show how they intend to hit climate change targets, under proposed Treasury rules. By 2023, they will have to set out detailed public plans for how they will move to a low-carbon future - in line with the UK's 2050 net-zero target. An expert panel will set the standards the plans need to meet to ensure they are not just spin. Any commitments will not be mandatory. Green groups say this is not enough. Net zero is when a business or a country achieves an overall balance between the amount of carbon it is emitting and the carbon that it's removing from the atmosphere. Check out more of the BBC's business stories from the COP26 summit Firms and their shareholders will be left to decide how their businesses adapt to this transition, including how they intend to decarbonise. And although the plans will need to be published, the government said \"the aim is to increase transparency and accountability\" and the UK was not \"making firm-level net-zero commitments mandatory\". The market will decide whether firms' plans are credible, the Treasury said. Speaking at the COP26 climate summit, Chancellor Rishi Sunak claimed the UK was leading the world in becoming the \"first-ever net zero aligned global financial centre\". He said the changes would mean: \"Better and more consistent climate data; sovereign green bonds; mandatory sustainability disclosures; proper climate risk surveillance; and proper global reporting standards.\" In total, 450 firms controlling 40% of global financial assets - equivalent to $130tn (£95tn) - have agreed to commit to limit global warming to 1.5C above pre-industrial levels. What does net zero mean?\nGreen investing: How your savings can fight climate change However, campaign group Global Witness said that without regulation the pledges were \"doomed to fail\". \"Banks and financiers are the lifeblood of the fossil fuel companies and destructive agribusinesses fuelling the climate crisis - so it's right that focus should be on them at COP26. \"However, today's announcement by banks risks amounting to more greenwashing if it's not legally binding,\" said Veronica Oakeshott, head of forests policy and advocacy at Global Witness. David Barmes, senior economist at the campaign group Positive Money, said the intention was positive, but that financial firms were still \"pouring billions into environmentally harmful projects.\" Mark Campanale, founder and executive chair of Carbon Tracker Initiative, praised the ambition of the plans, but said details of how it would work were still unclear. \"None of the financial assets announced are currently aligned with net-zero and no group of companies can say they are meeting the Paris target by continuing to invest in fossil fuels, so that needs to change considerably before London can be lauded as the world's first net-zero financial centre and a model for the world,\" he said. Shaun Spiers, executive director of environmental think tank Green Alliance, said that more UK public sector funding was needed. \"Private sector investment is vital, but it will be much easier to achieve on the back of serious investment by the chancellor,\" he said. However, a coalition of finance groups led by former Bank of England governor Mark Carney said there was enough finance committed to keep global warming to 1.5C. The Glasgow Financial Alliance for Net Zero (GFANZ) said more than $130trn (£95trn) of private capital \"is now committed to transforming the economy for net zero\". In practice, this means that bank loans which would go to an oil field, or a coal mine, are diverted to renewable energy or to a mortgage product that subsidises highly efficient homes. Bank bosses will also be expected to have tough conversations with their customers who want to build coal power stations, pulling funding in advanced nations now, and developing countries beyond the next decade. Can COP26 really save the planet?\nWhat's the climate impact of private jets at COP26?\nIs Greta Thunberg right about UK climate figures? Under the proposed Treasury rules, financial institutions and companies with shares listed on the London Stock Exchange must come up with net-zero transition plans, which will be published from 2023. The strategies will need to include targets to reduce greenhouse gas emissions, and steps which firms intend to take to get there. A taskforce made up of industry leaders, academics, regulators and civil society groups will set a science-based \"gold standard\" for the plans in order to guard against so-called \"greenwashing\" - where environmental initiatives are more about marketing than substance. However, the government said there was \"not yet a commonly agreed standard for what a good quality transition plan looks like\". Meanwhile, Mr Sunak also pledged that a target for developed countries to send $100bn (£720m) a year to those that are less developed - to help support their transition to net zero - will be achieved by 2023. Why the COP26 climate summit is important\nSimple guide to climate change\nWhat will climate change look like for you?\nWill the UK meet its climate targets?\nHow extreme weather is linked to climate change Alison Rose, chief executive of Natwest, told the BBC Radio 4 Today programme that the bank had started measuring the emissions on its balance sheet to help it track progress, saying \"transparency was critical\". She said the bank was working with the oil and gas industry \"to develop credible transition plans so we can track progress and work with our customers\". But Ms Rose said its main focus was helping small firms where there were \"real business opportunities\" in \"adopting sustainable supply chain [and] sustainable business practices\". Kay Swinburne, vice-chairman of financial services at KPMG UK, said the announcement on UK firms would provide the financial services industry with a \"valuable set of unified metrics to measure progress towards decarbonisation\". \"It is brave to put a gold standard in place for all companies raising funding,\" she added. And Dr Ben Caldecott, director of the UK Centre for Greening Finance and Investment, said the plans would \"spur demand for green finance and accelerate decarbonisation, not just in the UK but wherever UK firms do business\". Follow the money to net zero. That is the plan unveiled today, with two-fifths of the world's financial assets, $130tn, under the management of banks, insurers and pension funds that have signed up to 2050 net-zero goals including limiting global warming to 1.5C. This means that the giant laser beam of global finance will be fired towards technologies that lower and eradicate carbon emissions, and away from \"brown holdings\" of investments in coal, oil and gas. But can such fundamental ecological, economic and social change really be achieved more through financial carrot than by regulatory stick? This position suits politicians who don't necessarily want to tell their voting public to consume or travel less than they are used to. By changing the financial system, their hope is that the trajectory of every economic sector, from energy to transport, food to clothing, how we live, work and what we consume will decarbonise of their own accord.

            "content": "Christmas shoppers who have not already bought all their devices may not get them in time, the boss of one of the world's top chip designers has warned. Simon Segars, chief executive of chip firm Arm, said the mismatch between supply and demand is \"the most extreme\" he has ever seen. The \"unprecedented\" crisis won't be completely fixed by Christmas 2022, he predicted. In some cases, the wait for chips was taking 60 weeks, he said. With just over 50 shopping days until Christmas, the clock is ticking. \"If you haven't bought all your devices yet, you might be disappointed,\" he warned delegates at the Web Summit event in the Portuguese capital, Lisbon. \"It has never been like this before.\" Why is there a chip shortage?\nChip shortage could last into 2023, says car boss Arm chips power many of the world's smartphones. The British firm was acquired by Nvidia in September, but the $40bn (£29bn) deal is now the subject of a European Commission competition investigation, with regulators concerned that Nvidia could use the move to restrict access to Arm's technology. Mr Segars explained that the chip shortage was caused by a range of factors, including unprecedented demand for devices during the pandemic - as everyone rushed to find ways to communicate with their loved ones during lockdowns, and home-school their children. This was coupled with a sudden surge in demand for cars, and geo-political tensions between Asia and the West, he added. Commentators have also pointed to the rollout of 5G, the stockpiling of chips because of US sanctions on Huawei and the small number of manufacturing plants, as factors in the crisis. The Arm boss said the industry was spending $2bn (£1.5bn) a week to add capacity but warned that \"just building factories\" was not enough. The \"complicated and expensive\" process needed better collaboration across the entire supply chain, he said. ",

            "content": "Next says delays in supply chains, lorry driver shortages and \"pent-up demand\" diminishing will lead to sales slowing down over the Christmas period. The retailer said sales had risen by 14% in the last five weeks, but forecasted they would only increase by 10% by the end of the year. It said this was due to its supply chain being \"compounded by labour shortages\" in transport and warehouses. However, the High Street chain has predicted a full-year profit of £800m. In a trading statement, the company said stock availability had improved, but remained \"challenging\". It added prices rises in \"essential goods\" such as fuel might \"moderate demand\" and reduce sales growth through the festive season. \"The effects of pent‐up demand are likely to continue to diminish,\" the company added. Next said sales had increased 17% in the three months to the end of October compared with the same period in 2019. Online sales were also up 49.5% in the year to October, while retail purchases were down 28.8%. Steve Clayton, fund manager at HL Select said the \"going is getting tougher\" for Next, but said evidence suggested so far the company would \"handle these issues better than most\". \"There are near term challenges, but Next starts from a position of strength,\" he said. \"The company's comments about investing further into digital marketing, even as clouds gather, gives a clear message. Whatever happens in the months ahead, Next intends to emerge from the clouds with an even stronger position online.\" Next has previously warned of its warehouse and logistics staff being under pressure. Chief executive Lord Wolfson has said labour shortages could be solved by companies hiring overseas workers and paying a \"visa tax\". He previously told the BBC seasonal workers were difficult to recruit. Lord Wolfson suggested businesses could get visas for skills they \"desperately need\" and recommended that they should have to pay UK workers the same amount as overseas workers. To make this competitive, he argued businesses should have to pay a \"visa tax on top - lets say 7% of wages\". ",

            "content": "A typical UK home costs more than £250,000 for the first time after prices rose by 9.9% in the last year, according to the Nationwide. The building society said the average house price was £250,311 in October, up 0.7% on the previous month. It said this was an increase of £30,728 since the start of the pandemic. Covid has coincided with intense demand from buyers unmatched by supply. Official forecasters say the pace of house price rises will slow. \"The dynamics of the housing market may be about to shift slowly once again, but make no mistake, the boom still isn't over,\" said Nicky Stevenson, managing director at estate agent Fine & Country. UK house prices have risen sharply over the last 18 months owing to changing preferences of buyers, who are now looking for more indoor and outside space, but those properties have not been plentiful on the market. That has led to intense competition among potential buyers in some areas, particularly in rural and coastal spots. The market also been buoyed by tax incentives, with ministers introducing stamp duty holidays, as well as cheap borrowing costs. Those tax breaks are now over, and there is widespread speculation that mortgage rates will rise from the ultra-low levels of recent times. What an interest rate rise would mean for you\nThe epicentre of Britain's house price boom \"We expect house prices to continue to beat expectations in the near term before a gradual rise in mortgage rates applies the brakes in the second half of 2022,\" said Andrew Wishart, property economist at Capital Economics. The outcome of Thursday's Bank of England interest rate decision will be one factor affecting house prices in the months ahead. \"The outlook remains extremely uncertain,\" said Nationwide chief economist Robert Gardner. \"If the labour market remains resilient, conditions may stay fairly buoyant in the coming months - especially as the market continues to have momentum and there is scope for ongoing shifts in housing preferences.\" The government's official, independent forecaster - the Office for Budget Responsibility - said that house prices would continue to rise in the coming years, albeit at a slower rate. It means potential first-time buyers are facing another period of difficulty if they wish to buy a home, especially if the cost of borrowing rises. The OBR has now predicted that house prices will go up by 8.6% this year, compared with a year earlier. The annual rise would then slow to 3.2% in 2022, before decelerating further to 0.9% in 2023, it said. This would be followed by rises of 1.9% in 2024, 2.9% in 2025, and 3.5% in 2026, although longer-term forecasts and more difficult to make accurately. ",

            "content": "Toy sellers are expecting the return of generous grandparents this Christmas after Covid restricted families from meeting last year. A squeeze on parents' budgets and concerns over shipments for Christmas have dominated the festive run-up. One analyst said grandparents would play a bigger role in buying toys. Early indications suggest that sales are similar to last year but the type of toys on the shelves and the way they are bought has shifted. The Toy Retailers' Association has revealed the DreamToys list of what are predicted to be the biggest sellers this year and it shows how suppliers, retailers, and - to some extent - consumers are playing it safe. Toys linked to big TV and film brands like Star Wars, Pokemon and Paw Patrol dominate the list. Well-recognised brands such as Barbie and Hot Wheels also feature. Covid lockdowns put a dampener on many a family Christmas last year, but it also changed how and what toys and games were bought. Analysts said that sales grew unexpectedly in 2020, with outdoor games, puzzles for adults and large Lego sets all selling well. Online sales of toys and games outstripped those bought in stores owing to pandemic restrictions, said Melissa Symonds, UK toys director for the NPD Group consultancy. But owing to the reopening of the High Street earlier this year, that trend is expected to reverse, she said. Sales of \"impulse buys\" such as stickers, collectables, action figures and dolls are also expected to pick up. The return of festive family gatherings, and pressure on parents owing to general rises in the cost of living, mean grandparents' spending is expected to go up this year. NPD estimates that an average of £81 would be spent on Christmas toys for children aged up to 11, with each typically receiving seven toy and game gifts. Shipping and freight delays have dominated the agenda for the sector in recent months, even though consumer demand has been relatively unaffected. Last month, Barbie maker Mattel said families were still prioritising spending on children. It had raised prices after soaring shipping and raw materials costs. Gary Grant, boss of The Entertainer, who chairs the DreamToys selection committee, said manufacturers and retailers had stocked up on the big-brand toys which were predicted to sell well. He said the relatively large size and low value of toys meant they needed to be imported by ship, rather than by plane, to be viable. However, he was confident that most shipment problems seen in the summer had been overcome. He predicted no wholesale shortages, but still some disappointment close to Christmas. \"We expect a bigger list of items that are more challenging to get,\" he said. He described the next two weeks as critical to ensure everything needed arrived in time to sell before Christmas. ",

            "content": "Last week, Hong Kong doubled down on its Covid-19 restrictions - already among the strictest in the world. The news has led to dismay among the city's vibrant business community, with some questioning if this threatens its status as Asia's financial hub. The city's leader, Carrie Lam, announced that almost all exemptions from quarantine for overseas and mainland travellers would now end. She said this was to speed up China reopening to the region, but for some businesses, it's pushing them over the edge. Ms Lam has previously said that opening to mainland China is \"more important\" than [opening up] elsewhere. Hong Kong has one of the strictest mandatory quarantine regimes of any jurisdiction, with most arrivals having to undergo between 14 and 21 days of hotel quarantine. There have been a few exemptions. Diplomats, business leaders and some mainlanders with Hong Kong resident cards have been able to skip quarantine, or isolate at home. But not any more. \"We are caught in a sort of dilemma because in order to resume some quarantine-free travel with the mainland we have to ensure our anti-Covid 19 practices are more in line with the mainland practices,\" Ms Lam told reporters on Tuesday. The news has been met with dismay by Hong Kong's business community, who have already felt the strain of more than 18 months of closed borders. \"It has a big impact in a wide variety of directions,\" president of the American Chamber of Commerce in Hong Kong, Tara Joseph, tells the BBC. \"First, business sentiment about not being able to freely move about the world - which is crucial if you're an international business. \"Secondly, the personal impact of being away from family and important personal contacts. \"And last but not least, it has a huge impact on the talent pipeline for Hong Kong which means its domination as Asia's hub could lessen over time. We have no pipeline anymore, that's really worrying.\" Frederik Gollob, Chairman of the European Chamber of Commerce agrees: \"It certainly won't enhance confidence in Hong Kong to do business from an international business perspective.\" Business confidence in the city has already been hit in recent years, thanks to widespread pro-democracy protests, as well as the imposition of the controversial National Security Law which mandates harsh prison terms and can also impact foreigners. Ms Joseph adds it's not clear if restrictions are causing the city brain drain just yet - primarily because this trend takes some time to emerge. \"There is definitely a sense that people are considering, or thinking about leaving - and it's not just one organisation that's saying that,\" she says. \"When it comes to brain drain, people have this simple idea that you just pick up and go. But if you're a business executive, it's not that easy,\" she explains, mentioning challenges such as incomplete business projects, leases on homes and children enrolled in local schools. Asia's largest financial lobby group, which represents the interests of 155 financial institutions, including Goldman Sachs and BlackRock, warned the government last week of the impact of its \"highly restrictive\" border policies. In an unprecedented open letter to Hong Kong's financial secretary Paul Chan, the Asia Securities Industry and Financial Markets Association (Asifma) writes: \"We fear that if Hong Kong does not develop, and communicate, a clear and meaningful exit strategy from the current zero-case approach, as is the case in many other jurisdictions, Hong Kong risks losing its vital international status.\"\"The government must do its utmost to foster informed dialogue and full consideration of the long-term risks to livelihoods if its borders remain effectively closed, in contrast to competing international financial and business centres.\" The Asifma declined the BBC's request for an interview. The association's request for an exit plan comes as other countries in the region shift from a zero-Covid strategy - meaning a policy to bring cases down to zero - to instead living with the virus, with many nations reopening their borders. Rival financial hub, Singapore, for instance, is opening quarantine-free travel to 11 countries, including; Germany, Brunei, the US and UK, as part of its \"vaccinated travel lane\" policy. While Australia allowed vaccinated citizens and residents to re-enter without quarantine from Monday. New Zealand, Thailand and the Indonesian island of Bali, have also all made moves to reopen borders in recent weeks. As for Hong Kong, EuroCham's Mr Gollob says it's \"crystal clear that the China border comes first.\" \"We have to respect that. Obviously this is a big burden for the European and international business community in Hong Kong. \"But the silver lining is that members of ours, who have a vested interest in the mainland, will be able to take advantage of it. Mr Gollob says the strength of the wording of Asifma's letter was unexpected: \"It was a surprise to us that even the financial institutions need to be heard publicly\" he says. \"What we hear from our community is even echoed by the strongest institutions, which are the banks. That should be a very strong signal to the HK government.\" ",

However, one big setback for the business taught her that if a working atmosphere is too cordial, it may deter staff from telling each other when they are making mistakes. \"You can't be too nice,\" she says. \"You have to allow for people to challenge you.\" The Social Element is an agency which helps corporations connect with consumers on social media. \"What we provide is partly marketing, partly public relations and partly customer care,\" says Tamara. She founded the firm in 2003, when social media was in its infancy. Now it operates across the world, has an annual turnover of £9.2m a year and represents brands such as Oreo, Peloton, HSBC and Nissan. Tamara citers the positive working culture at The Social Element as one of the reasons for its success. \"I wanted people to be able to bring their best self to work,\" she says. \"It's very collaborative. It's very agile. It's very high on communication, as well, and it's created this sort of family culture. It's helped keep staff in the company.\" In 2014, with the business soaring in Europe and North America, Tamara decided to expand into the Asia-Pacific region. She chose Sydney in Australia as the base for operations. \"I felt that starting up an office in Australia would be a great next move for us,\" she says. \"We would be able to capture the Australian market and use it as a hub into Asia, as well. \"Essentially, I went with my gut. I'm quite an optimistic person and I just wanted to go for it. Everyone in the executive team went along with the idea.\" However, after a few months, Tamara had to abandon Sydney as a base and write off the scheme as a failure. \"Australian companies we brought on board were focused very much on the Australian market itself, and it wasn't the springboard into Asia that we'd been hoping for,\" she says. \"In retrospect, we should have gone to Hong Kong or Singapore.\" Afterwards, she learnt that many people on the executive team who had supported her idea had privately doubted it would be a success. \"They had been swept along by my optimism and positivity,\" says Tamara. \"But when we pulled out of Australia in the end, the executive team actually shared with me that they weren't 100% behind me. \"It was then that I realised that I had created this environment where it was all about being positive and optimistic, and they didn't want to be the negative person in the room, ruining it for everybody.\" Tamara says she had to re-think her company culture. The danger of having a cordial atmosphere, she says, was that it had bred what she calls \"toxic positivity\". \"I had created a cordial culture,\" she says, \"but I wondered whether that culture had been responsible for everyone agreeing to a bad decision. The ethos was, if anything, a little too nice. \"I decided that we really needed to focus on a new element, 'healthy conflict', where people are allowed to challenge each other in order to move forward in the best way for the company. Tamara says that atmosphere in her firm is still convivial, \"but now it's much more honest\". ",

            "content": "Follow the money to net zero. That is the plan unveiled today, with two-fifths of the world's financial assets, $130 trillion, under the management of banks, insurers and pension funds that have signed up to 2050 net-zero goals including limiting global warming to 1.5C. This means that the giant laser beam of global finance will be fired towards technologies that lower and eradicate carbon emissions, and away from \"brown holdings\" of investments in coal, oil and gas. The aim of the initiative chaired by former Bank of England Governor Mark Carney is to change the plumbing of the whole financial system forever. What does this mean in practice? Essentially the easy cheap bank financing that naturally flows to, say, an oil field, or a coal mine, is diverted to renewable energy or to a mortgage product that subsidises highly efficient homes. UK firms forced to plan for low-carbon future In fact all of this is already happening in niches, with loans raised for environmental investments attracting a flood of money, and so cheaper funding - something referred to as a \"greenium\". Bank chiefs say they are having tough conversations with their customers who want to build coal power stations, pulling funding in advanced nations now, and developing countries beyond the next decade. So that is the grand hope. Promisingly, the Chinese, whose public banks have been huge backers of coal around the world, have also said they will step back from such investments. But the negotiations in Glasgow will fall short of setting a global carbon price - the sort of measure that could really guarantee the path to net zero. They have also so far not come up with a globally consistent way for bank regulators to force the financial system to increase the risk and the cost of lending to carbon intensive industry. And then there is the really fundamental question about COP26's climate finance agenda: can such fundamental ecological, economic and social change really be achieved more through financial carrot than by regulatory stick? This position suits politicians who don't necessarily want to tell their voting public to consume or travel less than they are used to. By changing the financial system, their hope is that the trajectory of every economic sector, from energy to transport, food to clothing, how we live, work and what we consume will decarbonise of their own accord.

            "content": "It was a Tuesday night in September when Elizaveta Prigozhina posted a TikTok venting about her frustration at being unemployed. When she woke up the next day, she had gotten more than 10 interview offers - recruiters had seen her video, and took the bait. \"TikTok changed my life,\" Ms Prigozhina, 22, tells the BBC - the latest young person to benefit from a growing trend on the video sharing platform: \"CareerTok\". \"CareerTok\" is a subculture of career-themed videos on TikTok bursting with job-hunting advice, CV tips and work opportunities. Amid isolation and soaring unemployment caused by the Covid-19 pandemic, TikTok has become a surprise lifeline for young job-seekers. The hashtag \"CareerTok\" alone has over 70m views and rising. But the recent wave of job vacancies marked a sharp turn from the pandemic days when workers craved employment security. The national labour shortage - a by-product of what some economists call a \"Great Resignation\" - means US retailers now struggle to find staff.  TikTok itself noticed the trend and in July 2021 launched TikTok Resumes, a pilot programme where users could create a video CV showcasing their experience and skills to send directly to participating recruiters. Though the pilot lasted only a month, more than three dozen companies - from Target, a main street retailer, to Chipotle, a fast food chain, and even World Wrestling Entertainment - signed on as part of the programme. Job applicants submitted videos with the hashtag #TikTokResumes and through TikTokresumes.com (no longer operating at the time of this writing) to show off their skills, providing something like a personal essay with a looped in-audio. Though a TikTok CV isn't a formal job application, it functions as a way for employers to look at potential candidates and invite them to connect and interview. An \"incredibly competitive labour market\" compelled Chipotle to become one of the first restaurant brands to embrace TikTok recruiting. The chain has been experimenting with using the platform to hire staff since 2019, said Tressie Lieberman, the chain's vice-president for digital marketing. It has also explored using other social media platforms to reach younger applicants, Ms Lieberman said. While TikTok doesn't have updated statistics on the number of hires, the feature had most success bringing users into sports and entertainment-related positions, Elena Saavedra, the company's global communications officer, told the BBC. Examples of successful TikTok recruitment include Whalar, an influencer company that hired their associate director of creative and social strategy off TikTok, and the US National Hockey League, which hired an official photographer through the app. And according to LinkedIn, almost 80% of hiring managers believe that video has become more important when it comes to interacting with or vetting job candidates. Some video recruitment experiments have brought success for employers seeking new talent. A virtual career fair the company held in May on Discord, a gamer's favorite chat and video call service, helped increase applications by 77% over a week, for example. Though law firms and investment banks are unlikely to use TikTok to hire, experts say, the platform has potential to help recruitment in fields like social media, marketing and customer-facing roles, where personality is crucial to success. Makena Yee, 21, a communication student in Seattle, posted her TikTok resume in May 2021 seeking out roles in social media and public relations. Her video quickly racked up over 200,000 views, with around 20 recruiters messaging her on Instagram. Ms Yee said CV-Toks open the door to digital networking, allowing her generation to access a wider range of people and careers. \"Gen Z are a different breed of people when it comes to engaging and interacting with people,\" Ms Yee said. \"Most of the people I know I met on social media.\" Recruiters were also advertising over 50 manager and senior level roles through the app, Jonathan Javier and Jerry Lee, creators of a popular CareerTok account \"Wonsulting,\" told the BBC. Mr Javier argued that using the app gives older users an advantage because there is less competition in those age groups. Video resumes, however, strip away a level of anonymity, allowing employers to dismiss candidates based on how someone looks or acts, opening up potential for discrimination. There's also the question of the TikTok algorithm itself. The app has been criticised for moderating content on the basis of race, which TikTok denies. And it will take a while for video CVs to take over traditional resumes completely, said Jackie Cuevas, a hiring manager with over 150k followers on CareerTok. But TikTok might become a more important considering factor - just like LinkedIn, cover letters and online portfolios. Regardless of the results from TikTok's foray into jobs, recruiting is bound to evolve more broadly. The \"Great Resignation\" has seen millions of workers leaving their jobs in search of more money, more flexibility and more happiness, and that has the potential to reshape the market, experts say. The rapidly changing job market will require jobseekers and employers to stay ahead of the industry's trends, unorthodox though they may seem at first. The Great Resignation may well pave the way for \"TikTokfication\" in hiring. ",

            "header": "Shipping boss: 'Christmas will be safe' from shortages",
            "content": "Christmas trading will be safe from supply chain problems, the boss of shipping firm Maersk has told the BBC - adding, \"at least that's what I'm hearing from our customers\". The company handles almost 20% of the world's shipping containers. Chief executive Soren Skou, said the firm is chartering more ships, keeping ports open longer and has opened more warehouses to help. The firm is doing \"everything\" it can to alleviate the problems, he said. There have been recent warnings in the UK and the US that logjams at ports will lead to shortages at Christmas. Mr Skou said that a shortage of workers in the ports to unload ships and a lack of truckers was behind the problems. A Road Haulage Association (RHA) survey of its members estimates there is now a shortage of more than 100,000 qualified drivers in the UK. That number includes thousands of drivers from European Union (EU) member states who were previously living and working in the UK. There are also shortages across Europe and the US. Mr Skou estimated that approximately 300 large container ships around the world are sitting waiting outside ports. Almost 80 of these, he added, were in Los Angeles, with a \"few\" outside Felixstowe and others stuck by Chinese ports including Shanghai and Ningbo. Toy shops warn of Christmas shortages amid delays\nLA port to open round the clock to tackle queues\nWhy is there an HGV driver shortage? This widespread congestion was triggered by a collapse in demand during the early stages of the pandemic. That was followed by a period of frantic activity, as people who were forced to stay at home rather than travel or socialise, ordered large quantities of consumer goods. Mr Skou, who runs the world's biggest shipping firm, said this shows no sign of easing: \"The reality is that consumer demand is strong and at the same time our customers inventories are low.\" \"They both need to serve the consumer here and now, but also rebuild inventories and that's why we have an unprecedented demand situation\". The demand has meant Maersk and other shipping companies have been able to charge record prices. The Danish company's pre-tax profits rose fivefold to $5.9bn for the July to September period. Last week Japanese cargo line Ocean Network Express reported a more than eight fold jump in profits for the same period, to $4.2bn. One of UK's biggest toy retailers, The Entertainer, recently warned delays at UK ports will result in shortages this Christmas. In the US, the port of Los Angeles has started operating 24 hours a day to clear a backlog of cargo ships which has led to shortages. White House officials warned that there \"will be things that people can't get\" during the holiday season, despite President Biden appointing a bottlenecks Czar. Simon Heaney of the maritime research firm Drewry, said Maersk's mitigations might not be enough. Mr Heaney explained that \"port congestion is worsening while the number of ships waiting outside major ports around the world is increasing\". The brief closure of some big container terminals due to China's coronavirus restrictions, extreme weather events and a rise in the Delta variant of coronavirus, are each playing a part Mr Heaney said. Mr Heaney added that opening ports for longer won't help if there aren't enough staff to run them. 90% of global trade is moved by sea and with demand having shown no sign of easing, the shipping industry is looking to tackle its impact on climate change. It's responsible for about 2% of carbon emissions, meaning that if the industry was a country it would be the sixth biggest polluter, above Germany. The UN's International Maritime Organisation (IMO) is aiming for a 50% reduction in greenhouse gas emissions by 2050 compared to 2008 levels. As world leaders meet to tackle climate change in Glasgow Mr Skou was critical of the targets set by the UN body that oversees his industry: \"The ambition level at the IMO so far has been quite limited\". \"We as Maersk certainly are pushing hard for that to be reducing by 100% in 2050 and we believe it can be done\". Shipping industry calls for new global carbon tax\nSummit aims for clean-up of shipping industry\n$5bn fund unveiled for climate-friendly shipping On Monday at the COP26 climate summit in Glasgow Denmark's Prime Minister Mette Frederiksen said: \"We urge the IMO to take action to set ambitious targets to achieve zero emission shipping by 2050\". \"Carbon-neutral shipping is vital to reaching our climate goals,\" he added. Shipping was not included in the Paris climate agreement. The International Chamber of Shipping has backed a $5bn fund to develop carbon free shipping and overcome a lack of investment in the technology required. Maersk plans to launch the world's first carbon neutral cargo ship in 2023. However, Mr Skou said the slow progress doesn't mean we need to move fewer goods around the world to tackle climate change. \"I think we just have to get to the point that we can use different fuels,\" he added.

            "content": "Four energy suppliers have become the latest companies to go bust amid the soaring cost of wholesale gas prices. Omni Energy Limited, MA Energy Limited, Zebra Power Limited, and Ampoweruk Ltd have ceased trading, the regulator Ofgem said. Together, the companies supplied about 23,700 customers. They are the latest energy companies to go under as increased gas prices have made price promises to customers undeliverable. A total of 19 energy suppliers, mostly smaller firms, are thought to have gone bust since August, affecting about two million customers. Out of the four companies to go under on Tuesday, Zebra Power Limited has the largest customer base, with 14,800. Omni Energy supplies about 6,000 domestic pre-payment customers, while Ampoweruk Ltd has about 600 domestic customers and about 2,000 non-domestic. MA Energy has about 300 non-domestic customers. Ofgem said customers of the four firms would continue to receive energy supplies and any credit to their accounts would be protected. Affected customers will be switched to a new tariff by Ofgem and be contacted by their new supplier, the regulator said. Ofgem added domestic customers would also be protected by the energy price cap when being switched to a new supplier. The regulator's price cap, which covers 15 million households across England, Wales and Scotland, protects customers on default tariffs by limiting charges including how much customers pay per unit of energy. Ofgem has said an \"unprecedented increase\" in global gas prices was putting financial pressure on energy suppliers. High demand for gas and reduced supply has been behind the recent surge in wholesale prices, although other factors such as a colder winter in Europe last year. Neil Lawrence, director of retail at Ofgem, said the regulator's \"number one priority\" was to protect customers. \"I want to reassure affected customers that they do not need to worry: under our safety net we'll make sure your energy supplies continue. If you have credit on your account the funds you have paid in are protected and you will not lose the money that is owed to you.\" Ofgem has advised affected customers to wait and not switch supplier until it appoints a new one. \"We will update you when we have chosen a new supplier, who will then get in touch about your tariff,\" Mr Lawrence added. Customers will still continue to receive gas or electricity even if the energy supplier goes bust. Ofgem will move your account to a new supplier, but it may take a few weeks. Your new supplier should then contact you to explain what is happening with your account\nWhile you wait to hear from your new supplier: check your current balance and - if possible - download any bills; take a photo of your meter reading\nIf you pay by direct debit, there is no need to cancel it straight away, Citizens Advice says. Wait until your new account is set up before you cancel it\nIf you are in credit, your money is protected and you'll be paid back.

            "content": "Yahoo has become the latest US tech company to end its presence in mainland China as tougher regulations are imposed there. The firm said its decision was due to an \"increasingly challenging business and legal environment\" in the country\". Yahoo users in China are now greeted with a message saying its sites are no longer accessible. The company says Yahoo products and services remain unaffected elsewhere around the world. In a statement, it says: \"Yahoo remains committed to the rights of our users and a free and open internet. We thank our users for their support.\" Yahoo's move follows closely behind Microsoft's announcement last month that it was removing LinkedIn - its business-focused social network - from China, something it also blamed on \"a significantly more challenging operating environment and greater compliance requirements\". Will Apple be the last US tech giant in China?\nMicrosoft shutting down LinkedIn in China China is in the midst of a large-scale crackdown on big tech companies - both those from the US and its own native giants. A range of laws passed in recent years contributes to what Yahoo and others characterise as a \"challenging\" market. The Personal Information Protection Law - or PIPL - which came into effect on 1 November, is one of them. Designed as a Chinese data-protection law, it introduces a range of regulations about how data can be collected and stored, with the threat of potentially massive fines of up to 5% of a company's annual turnover. Foreign entities processing user information - such as through web cookies and services - must have a presence, or appoint a representative on the Chinese mainland, responsible for enforcement. In some ways, it is not dissimilar from privacy-focused laws, such as GDPR in Europe. But the political environment is significantly different in China from that in many western nations, with strict censorship requirements. Some Western tech firms have been criticised for having links to China, or for storing user data there. Even Chinese firms are suffering the effects of a broader tech crackdown, part of a five-year plan from the state to regulate its economy. Bitcoin mining has been devastated by a blanket ban on the trading of crypto-currencies, while Alibaba was handed a record $2.8bn (£2bn) fine earlier this year. And the crackdown extends to gaming, too - which officials have likened to digital drugs - while introducing rules that severely limit children's use of online games. Once a rival to Google as the search engine of choice in the early days of the internet, Yahoo has seen its fortunes dip over the past two decades. Today, it still provides web portal services - a landing page with a range of news, alongside email and search functions. But it has been eclipsed by Google and newer giants, such as Facebook and Twitter. It also owns a number of media brands, such as technology news sites Engadget and TechCrunch, which are also no longer accessible in China. It has changed hands several times, most recently in May, when US telecoms firm Verizon sold it and AOL to a private-equity firm for $5bn. ",

            "content": "Elon Musk says no contract has been signed with Hertz after the rental car company announced a deal that led to Tesla's market value surpassing $1 trillion. Last week, shares in Tesla jumped 12.6% after Hertz said it had ordered 100,000 vehicles by the end of 2022. However, Mr Musk tweeted: \"I'd like to emphasize that no contract has been signed yet.\" Yet Hertz told the BBC: \"Deliveries of the Teslas already have started.\" A spokeswoman said: \"As we announced last week, Hertz has made an initial order of 100,000 Tesla electric vehicles and is investing in new EV (electric vehicle) charging infrastructure across the company's global operations.\" Hertz refused to confirm if a contract had or had not been signed with Tesla in light of Mr Musk's tweet, adding it did not discuss details of its business relationships or discussions. Tesla has not responded to the BBC's request for comment. The deal announced last week by Hertz with Tesla was the biggest-ever rental car order for electric vehicles. \"Electric vehicles are now mainstream, and we've only just begun to see rising global demand and interest,\" said Hertz interim boss Mark Fields. It was reported Hertz would pay $4.2bn for 100,000 Model 3s over the next 14 months, which amounts to about a fifth of its fleet. The rental firm would also build a network of charging stations. Hertz said that \"beginning in early November and expanding through year end\" customers would be able to rent a Tesla Model 3 at Hertz airport and neighbourhood locations at certain areas in the US and Europe. The BBC is not responsible for the content of external sites.\nView original tweet on Twitter But on Monday, Tesla boss Mr Musk tweeted: \"Tesla has far more demand than production, therefore we will only sell cars to Hertz for the same margin as to consumers. \"Hertz deal has zero effect on our economics.\" Tesla became the fifth company to surpass a market value of $1 trillion on 25 October, behind Apple, Microsoft, Amazon and Google-owner Alphabet. In response to a tweet about the Hertz deal on 25 October, Mr Musk said it was \"strange that moved valuation, as Tesla is very much a production ramp problem, not a demand problem\". He later added: \"To be clear, cars sold to Hertz have no discount. Same price as to consumers.\" Tesla shares have been trading down more than 4% in pre-market trading in the US. It is not the first time that Mr Musk's tweets regarding his company have made the news. In May 2020, he wiped $14bn (£11bn) off the carmaker's value after tweeting its share price was too high. And two years earlier, a tweet about Tesla's future on the New York stock market led to regulators fining the company $20m and Mr Musk agreeing to have all further posts on the platform pre-screened by lawyers. Tesla announced on Tuesday it was launching a pilot of 10 \"supercharger\" stations in the Netherlands, which will be available to all electric vehicle models. As part of its charging network expansion plans, the company said opening up its charging sites to non-Telsa drivers was \"critical for large-scale EV adoption\". Tesla has also been forced to recall 11,704 vehicles over a software problem that could cause \"false forward-collision warnings and/or automatic emergency brake events\". A US National Highway Traffic Safety Administration notice said it was \"not aware of any crashes or injuries\" because of this problem. Tesla is fixing the problem with a software update. Why is Elon Musk playing down talk of a deal with Hertz to sell 100,000 cars? After all, it sounds positive - and appeared to send the share price soaring. Firstly, such a deal might actually be better news for Hertz than Tesla. The car rental firm recently emerged from bankruptcy protection and wants to portray itself as a go-getting modern company. Running Teslas fits the bill. But Tesla doesn't really need Hertz. It's making cars as fast as it can, and insists there is no shortage of demand. Rental firms often buy surplus stock at a discount, but Mr Musk has made it clear if Hertz wants his cars it'll have to pay full price. Meanwhile, the Tesla boss has an uneasy relationship with market regulators. His public insistence that a deal with Hertz \"has zero effect on our economics\", and that no contract has yet been signed could be seen as a message that if Tesla's valuation is rocketing - increasing his personal wealth in the process - it isn't because of anything he has said.

            "content": "Morrisons has backed down after customers complained about its labelling of a chicken meat product as containing \"non-EU salt and pepper\". The supermarket chain's salt-and-pepper chicken crown features the Union Flag on its label, which says that it is \"made from British chicken\". The label provoked an angry reaction on Twitter, including one accusation of stoking \"anti-EU hatred\". In response, the firm said the wording was \"an error for which we apologise\". \"We are changing the packaging immediately,\" its tweet added. A spokesman for Morrisons said: \"It is adhering to packaging regulations rather than making any political point.\" The supermarket said it would change the packaging and de-emphasise the mention of non-EU salt and pepper, but said it would still have to be included somewhere on the wrapping because of packaging laws. According to government guidance on food labelling, the term \"non-EU\" must be used on meat packaging when full country information is unavailable. From October next year, following post-Brexit rule changes, this will be replaced by \"non-UK\". Among the reactions from customers, some pointed out the irony of a soon-to-be US-owned supermarket displaying its British credentials. Last month, Morrisons shareholders approved a multi-billion pound takeover offer from US private equity group Clayton, Dubilier & Rice (CD&R). Others poked fun at the wording in other ways, with one person tweeting: \"I've just had a look at my salt and pepper and it has no country of origin on it. It's from Aldi... \"Does that mean it's non-EU or not? Is it safe to put it on an English chicken? Asking for Morrisons...\" One customer raised the issue of food miles, saying: \"In other words, they get their S&P from somewhere further away, creating more impact on the climate.\" Another queried how useful such information was for shoppers, tweeting: \"Aside from anything else, I'd have thought most normal people want to know where foodstuff IS from, not where it isn't.\" The move comes in the midst of a debate in the food retailing industry about firms' increasing tendency to use patriotic imagery on packaging, with trade publication The Grocer identifying it as part of a post-Brexit \"culture war\". However, those who support the trend see the \"made in the UK\" tag as a sign of quality rather than a political statement. ",

Picket lines are in place at Burton Latimer and Corby in Northamptonshire, with workers saying proposed changes could leave them up to £5,000 per year worse off. The Unite union said Weetabix was \"serving corporate greed\". Weetabix said it was confident a resolution could be found. The strike action started in September at the Weetabix Mills factory in Burton Latimer, and at its plant on the Earlstrees Industrial Estate, Corby. Around 80 engineers have been on strike every Tuesday and Wednesday since then. Unite announced that from 8 November, those days would double to also include Mondays and Thursdays. The union said the action had already \"closed production lines and put orders several days behind schedule\". Weetabix engineers go on strike in pay row\nUnite leader joins Weetabix engineers' picket line Unite general secretary Sharon Graham said: \"Weetabix is making bumper profits so there is no justification for these 'fire and rehire' attacks on our members' wages and conditions. \"They are just not swallowing what in reality is a serving of corporate greed.\" Unite regional officer Sean Kettle added that members were \"determined\" to \"fend off these unjustified pay grabs\". A spokesperson from the Weetabix Food Company said the business respected the right of its engineering team to go on strike, but said it was \"unfair and inaccurate to compare our discussions with our engineers over changes permitted within their existing contracts to other disputes that require new contracts to be signed or face dismissal\". The company said its plans involved the \"standardisation of existing shift patterns\", which it said would lead to an increase in take-home pay. The spokesperson added: \"While the voluntary choice of moving to a working pattern during the day does not come with the same level of shift premium for obvious reasons, the proposal is very much in line with other similar businesses.\" The two factories also produce Alpen, Weetos and Oatibix.

Mr Keating said the consulting division had a \"stellar\" first half of the year with revenues up 18% year-on-year. That included a contract to migrate a major bank's risk system to the Google cloud, where the firm worked in partnership with Google. During this period its consulting services were mostly delivered through remote working.

            "content": "A digital token inspired by the popular South Korean Netflix series Squid Game has lost almost all of its value as it was revealed to be an apparent scam. Squid, which marketed itself as a \"play-to-earn cryptocurrency\", had seen its price soar in recent days - surging by thousands of per cent. However, as the BBC reported, it was criticised for not allowing people to resell their tokens. This kind of scam is commonly called a \"rug pull\" by crypto investors. This happens when the promoter of a digital token draws in buyers, stops trading activity and makes off with the money raised from sales. Squid's developers have made off with an estimated $3.38m (£2.48m), according to technology website Gizmodo. \"Play-to-earn\" cryptocurrency is where people buy tokens to use in online games and can earn more tokens which can later be exchanged for other cryptocurrencies or national currencies. Squid Game cryptocurrency rockets in value\nChinese viewers slam 'copycat' Squid Game show Last Tuesday, Squid was trading at just 1 cent. In less than a week its price had jumped to over $2,856. Its value has now plummeted by 99.99%, said cryptocurrency data website CoinMarketCap. Squid was billed as a token that could be used for a new online game inspired by the Netflix series - which tells the story of a group of people forced to play deadly children's games for money. The game was due to go live this month. However, cryptocurrency experts had warned of several tell-tale signs that it was likely to be a scam. Most telling was that people who bought Squid tokens were unable to sell them. Critics also highlighted that its website contained many spelling mistakes and grammatical errors. The website is no longer online and social media accounts promoting the tokens have also vanished. \"It is one of many schemes by which naïve retail investors are drawn in and exploited by malevolent crypto promoters,\" Cornell University economist Eswar Prasad told the BBC. Professor Prasad said buyers need to be aware when buying cryptocurrencies as there is almost no regulatory oversight. \"In fact, open pump and dump schemes are rampant in the crypto world, with investors often jumping in with eyes wide open, perhaps hoping that they can ride the wave and dump their holdings for a quick profit before prices collapse,\" he said. Squid was available for sale on decentralised crypto exchanges including PancakeSwap and DODO, which allows for buyers to connect directly to sellers, without a central authority. \"Nowadays new coins can be listed on decentralised exchanges on the first day they are created, without any regulation or due diligence,\" said Jinnan Ouyang from Singapore-based crypto company Openmining. \"So you could be buying coins from anyone with any agenda.\" ",

            "content": "Roblox has issued an apology to the millions of fans who were unable to get online over the last three days. The game platform and creation system suffered a blackout after the outage, which began on Thursday. On Sunday the company said the outage had been caused by a \"bug\". Roblox said the issue took longer to fix than \"any of us would have liked\", echoing complaints from millions of its players who took to social media during the lengthy downtime. The BBC is not responsible for the content of external sites.\nView original tweet on Twitter \"We are sorry for the length of time it took us to restore service,\" David Baszucki, Roblox's founder and CEO, said in a blog post. Mr Baszucki said \"a subtle bug\" - while systems were under heavy load - was responsible. \"This was not due to any peak in external traffic or any particular experience,\" he said, but rather a growth in the number of servers the company uses. Some players had initially speculated the problems had been caused by a spike in traffic due to the popularity of a burrito promotion from a fast-food chain, which had encouraged players to visit its in-game restaurant. That theory was dismissed when Roblox said the problems were not down to a surge in traffic. On Sunday, the restaurant tweeted an image of a cashier at the in-game eatery with a sign reading: \"Pls don't yell at me. The burrito is innocent\". The BBC is not responsible for the content of external sites.\nView original tweet on Twitter Roblox said it first noticed users were having trouble connecting to the game on 28 October: \"This immediately became our highest priority\", it said. \"Teams began working around the clock to identify the source of the problem and get things back to normal.\" The problem persisted for nearly three days. The company said it will conduct a post-mortem to help avoid a similar situation in the future. Since the coronavirus pandemic closed schools and kept children at home, the popularity of the platform surged. Since March 2020, 50 million new users joined the game, and there are now more than 42 million active daily users. The majority of them are under 16.

            "content": "Households will remain worse off than they were before the pandemic until 2023, the UK's independent forecaster has warned. Charlie Bean, an Office for Budget Responsibility (OBR) committee member, told MPs that incomes would not return to 2019 levels for another two years. He said the main reason was \"a very low rate of productivity growth\". The pandemic effectively froze large parts of the economy, with many businesses shut entirely. Mr Bean said: \"We don't have real household disposable income getting above pre-pandemic levels until the back end of 2023, and it's growing at a pretty mediocre rate from then on.\" He was asked at a Treasury Committee hearing about the weak rise in real household disposable incomes since the financial crisis, with incomes forecast to have grown by just 2.4% between 2008 and 2024 compared with an increase of 36% in the 16 years before the crisis. \"We do have a modest pickup in productivity growth [in our forecast]. But it's not back up to anything like the pre-epidemic rates,\" he said. The forecast has similarities to one from the Institute for Fiscal Studies last week, delivered in response to the Budget. That also predicted a poor near-term outlook for personal finances, saying it expected weak inflation and higher taxes would negate many wage rises. It also said low-income households would also feel \"real pain\" as the cost of living was set to increase faster than benefit payments. Meanwhile, the OBR's chairman, Richard Hughes, told MPs on the committee Rishi Sunak could struggle to meet his targets of both reducing debt and balancing the current budget deficit in three years. He said: \"The chancellor set himself some new fiscal rules in this budget and they are to get debt falling as a share of GDP (gross domestic product) by 2024/25 and balance the current budget. \"The headroom he set aside to reach those targets is the second-lowest headroom that any chancellor has had when setting fiscal rules.\" He said there was very little room for error: \"Just a 1% interest rate rise could easily wipe out the chancellor's headroom.\" The Bank of England's Monetary Policy Committee (MPC) is meeting on Thursday to decide whether to raise the interest rate from a historic low of 0.1%.

            "content": "The family at the helm of Canada's biggest wireless provider, Rogers Communications, has descended into civil war. The bitter power struggle is now headed to court. It was just after 3am on a Sunday, and Martha Rogers couldn't sleep. She took to Twitter to agonise about the fate of her father's eponymous telecoms firm, Rogers, a giant in Canada's corporate landscape and the centrepiece of their family's multi-billion dollar dynasty. \"With 24,000 employees and mortgages on the line, it's not easy,\" Ms Rogers wrote. The company, a C$30bn ($24bn; £17bn) behemoth, is the mobile carrier of nearly 11 million Canadians, with a stake in everything from hockey to cable television. The family name is a staple of the Toronto skyline and is emblazoned across one of Canada's largest stadiums. But Rogers has struggled since the death of its founder in 2008, and now its future has been thrown into question by an epic family feud. Ms Rogers, her sister and mother have split from her older brother Edward after he attempted to oust the company's chief executive and other members of its independent board in September, launching an unusually public row in Canada's business world. Two separate groups of directors are now claiming to represent Rogers - exposing old family rivalries and unwanted turbulence ahead of a pending $26bn takeover of a rival telecoms firm. Already, shares of Rogers have slumped as the family drama plays out. The fallout could affect everything from professional sports to local politics. \"It's moving from 'Succession' to 'Game of Thrones',\" said Richard Powers, professor at the University of Toronto's Rotman School of Management. \"These are very important times for the company, and the last thing they need is this distraction.\" The plot at the moment is straight out of HBO. The drama launched last month when Edward, 52, sought to replace Rogers chief executive Joe Natale, blaming him for the firm's underperformance. But matriarch Loretta Rogers, 82, and her daughters closed rank, backing Mr Natale and later voting to remove Edward as chairman of the Rogers board. In turn, Mr Rogers filed suit in British Columbia, seeking legal approval to reconstitute the company's board and restore his position of chair - without consulting shareholders. The court has scheduled a hearing for Monday. \"Ed's perpetual tantrums when he doesn't get his way\" were \"turning into Toronto's own real life soap opera,\" Martha Rogers tweeted. Through a representative, Mr Rogers declined an interview request, but said in a statement that \"decisive action was needed to return the company to stability\" and close a pending merger with competitor Shaw Communications. In court documents, Mr Rogers said he had grown \"increasingly concerned\" with Mr Natale's performance. Rogers has been beset by sluggish growth in wireless revenue, stagnant share prices and, most recently, a loss of roaming revenue due to Covid-19 travel curbs. Mr Natale, 57, did not respond to a request for comment. \"I have the greatest respect for Joe Natale,\" said Rotman's Prof Powers. \"He has excellent experience, by all reports doing an excellent job. Not good enough, apparently, according to Edward.\" Mr Rogers had aimed to replace him with Tony Staffieri, who had been the Rogers Chief Financial Officer. But in a bizarre twist, the covert plan was exposed when Mr Staffieri accidentally pocket-dialled Mr Natale while discussing it with someone else, an incident first reported by the Globe and Mail newspaper. After learning of the scheme, Mr Natale informed an independent director, prompting an emergency board meeting, where the majority of the group - including Mrs Rogers and her daughters - backed him. Mr Staffieri left the company days later. Mr Rogers alleged in court documents that the Rogers board had initially agreed to replace Mr Natale, and that the CEO had begun preparing for retirement. Two days later, they reversed course. But his family has presented a very different version of events, saying he had misled them about Mr Natale's performance. The board stripped Mr Rogers of his chairman title. His mother and two sisters all cast votes against him. Mr Rogers then called his own meeting of what he deemed a newly-constituted board of Rogers to reinstall him. Mrs Rogers called the actions \"invalid\", saying in a statement that her son was proceeding down a \"misguided and miscalculated path\". \"He should stop immediately, as his behaviour simply serves to underscore his seemingly wanton disregard for good governance,\" she said. His sister, Martha, wrote on Twitter that his appointment \"should be taken as seriously as if he appointed himself the King of England.\" Rogers Communications was founded by patriarch Ted Rogers in 1960, when he bought Canada's first FM radio station in Toronto. The elder Rogers ran the company until his death in 2008, having overseen its expansion from a small cable TV firm into one of the country's most powerful corporations. Beyond the core telecoms firm, Rogers today owns a variety of businesses. The company owns the Toronto Blue Jays baseball team, and holds a stake in Maple Leaf Sports & Entertainment, which owns both the Toronto Maple Leafs hockey team and the Toronto Raptors basketball team. But the firm has sometimes stumbled since its founder's death. \"Rogers has been underperforming,\" said Richard Leblanc, a professor of law, governance and ethics at York University in Toronto. \"And that's because of interpersonal dynamics.\" Mr Rogers' death left a vacuum, he said, and it has been filled, in part, by \"intense\" sibling rivalry with Edward, Ted Rogers' only son, often at the centre. When his father died, Edward became chair of the Rogers Control Trust - a family-run entity which controls the majority of Rogers Communications shares. In this seat, Mr Rogers has broad authority to vote the family's shares in the public company: 97.5% of all voting shares at Rogers Communications. His father once compared the position's power to that of the president of the United States - and, according to Prof Leblanc, it is a highly unusual arrangement. \"I've never seen that, in 25 years of corporate governance, so much power concentrated in one individual,\" he said. In January 2018, the Rogers board voted to appoint Mr Rogers as chair, further consolidating his authority. He has frequently come up against the company's CEOs, who have seen abrupt ends to their tenure after falling out of favour. Mr Natale is the third CEO in the past 10 years. \"It seems like Edward likes them until he doesn't,\" said the University of Toronto's Prof Powers. Mr Rogers has further courted controversy in conducting his public life. His family drew the ire of some earlier this year after his wife, Suzanne, posted a photo of herself, her husband and their two sons with former US President Donald Trump at his Florida resort Mar-a-Lago. Their apparent affection for Mr Trump angered many Canadians upset by the former president's response to Covid-19, his role in the 6 January Capitol riots, and his energetic dispute of the 2020 election results. But for some, Mr Rogers committed his cardinal sin outside the family feud. According to the Toronto Star newspaper, he had sought to end the tenure of the president of the Toronto Raptors basketball team, Masai Ujiri. (The team is part owned by Rogers.) Mr Ujiri, who led the Raptors to their first-ever NBA championship win, is adored by Canadians. Mr Rogers apparently felt differently, arguing Mr Ujiri was not worth the amount offered. For Torontonians in particular, alleged disloyalty to Mr Ujiri crossed a line. Until this month, the Rogers family had publicly stood behind him. But his attempt to remove CEO Mr Natale \"was a bridge too far\", said Prof Leblanc. \"We'll spend every penny defending the company, employees & Ted [Rogers]'s wishes, nothing you can do will deter us,\" Martha wrote in a tweet, seemingly directed at her brother. \"Bring. It. On.\" The issue now before a British Columbia (BC) court is whether Mr Rogers can push through changes to the Rogers' board without calling a shareholder meeting. In his suit, Mr Rogers has argued that in BC, where Rogers is incorporated, such a change may be made through a written resolution. And experts say Mr Rogers may have the legal upper hand thanks to his control of the family trust, which gives him authority over so much of the company's voting shares. Amid the turmoil, Toronto's mayor John Tory has reportedly been dragged into the role of mediator by the Rogers family. He has long been a board member and a confidante to the family. He has been forced to field questions over how his work with Rogers fits with his mayoral duties after it was reported that he received payment from the trust. \"John Tory gets paid to be Rogers family therapist, but it's the city that could do with a session,\" read one newspaper headline. Even if a BC judge rules in Mr Rogers' favour on Monday, it may be a pyrrhic victory. The company's stock has fallen more than 8% on the Toronto Stock Exchange since 21 October, when Mr Rogers was removed as chairman. And if he is reinstated, he will preside over a badly fractured board as it navigates a complicated takeover, which still needs regulatory approval. Most observers think the deal will be completed, but with some modifications. The Ontario Securities Commission has made inquiries this past week in the wake of the family row, Prof Leblanc said, adding he \"would not rule out\" that the merger may ultimately fall through. \"You have, essentially, a dysfunctional board and dysfunctional family,\" said Prof Leblanc. \"And the market does not like uncertainty.\" Graphics by Angélica Casas ",

            "content": "Ryanair says it is expecting to cut fares this winter to help boost passenger demand. While the airline has seen business picking up recently, it warned it was still recovering from the Covid-related collapse in air travel. Ryanairreported a narrowing of half-year losses, but warned its annual deficit could hit €200m (£170m). Boss Michael O'Leary told the BBC the industry was seeing a \"very strong recovery\" across Europe. However, he said heavy price discounting would be needed to fill aircraft this winter. Keeping prices low and passenger numbers high would \"set us up strongly for a very strong recovery\", he said. Mr O'Leary added that the number of empty seats per plane would shrink from around 20% to under 10% by next summer. The airline expects to return to profitability in the year ending March 2023. \"We're seeing very strong recovery in short-haul travel across Europe and it is being led by Ryanair,\" he told the BBC's Today programme. He said there had been a \"dramatic\" recovery in passenger numbers, from eight million in the three months to June to 31 million in the following three months. On the Beach accuses Ryanair of market abuse\nRefund probe into Ryanair and BA dropped The recent school holidays had seen Ryanair \"full to the gills as people got a last bit of sun\", Mr O'Leary said. But that did not mean the hit to the industry from the coronavirus pandemic was over, he added. The carrier reported an after-tax loss of €48m for the six months to September, which compared with a loss after tax of €411m a year earlier. Ryanair carried 39.1 million passengers in the six months to the end of September, 54% fewer than in the same period of 2019. The airline is expecting to make of loss of between €100m-200m for the full year, but Mr O'Leary said the guidance could not be more specific because there was still \"little visibility\" on ticket prices and recovery. But he said the post-pandemic recovery offered the best growth opportunities of his three-decade career. In September, Ryanair lifted its passenger growth target. The airline now expects to fly 225 million passengers a year by 2026, up from 200 million previously forecast. The airline reiterated it expects to return to pre-Covid profitability in the year ending March 2023. ",

            "content": "What would you do if your mother walked into traffic while you were at work? This was the question posed to Zoe Wong from Bristol in a formal job interview. She's the primary carer for her mum, Stella, who has Alzheimer's and is in remission from cancer. \"I was quite stunned,\" Ms Wong says. \"It made me feel like I now had less to give as an active member of the workforce, that I was worth less than other people and should be expecting to receive less.\" The 'hidden' role of unpaid carers in lockdown\nCare worker shortage is watchdog's biggest worry Her mum is just 66, yet the ravages of Alzheimer's and cancer mean she can do very little for herself. This leaves Ms Wong doing a balancing act that one in worker in seven is engaged in - holding down a job while caring for a loved one. Ms Wong says: \"Until you experience it as a person, you don't necessarily understand the gravity of the role. It can be like trying to explain the colour purple to someone who can't see.\" She's part of an army of 13.6 million unpaid carers, who are thought to save the taxpayer £132bn a year by taking on duties that would otherwise fall to the state. In the six years that she's been part of that army, she's had a mixed experience when it comes to employers. Some bosses have understood the pressures she faces. But others have been less empathetic. During one of her previous jobs, she only got about three hours' sleep a night: \"I fell asleep in a meeting, and I was pulled aside by my manager and he told me quite bluntly that he didn't care about my personal circumstances - that I shouldn't be bringing them to work.\" Other potential employers have suggested she write out a formal statement, outlining how she would balance work and her caring duties. There have been times, Ms Wong says, that she simply couldn't square the circle and had to leave her job. She's far from alone. Before the pandemic took hold, it was estimated that 600 people a day were leaving their job because they couldn't balance work with caring, at a cost of £1.7bn a year to the economy. The government is seeking to address that by expanding the right to flexible working and allowing workers five days' unpaid caring leave. But what are companies doing about this? Insurance giant Aviva is among a growing number of firms taking action to make sure unpaid carers are cared for. It gives its workforce up to 70 hours in paid carers' leave and encourages managers to accommodate flexible working requests. Anthony Fitzpatrick is head of employment policy at the group: \"If you can relieve some of the stress points [for workers] , then they feel engaged, they feel motivated and it encourages them to do a great job.\" \"And if they're doing a great job, the benefit of that is to the customer, and that helps grow the business as well. So for me, there's an absolute business case.\" He also points out that it helps retain experienced staff who might otherwise have to leave. Mr Fitzpatrick thinks the pandemic has made it even more imperative that companies adopt more accommodating policies towards unpaid carers: \"We're starting to see an increase in people taking more registered time off for caring. That shows that the policy really is needed.\" We live with an ageing population - and that means more of us could end up taking on the care of elderly relatives. Laura Bennett, policy chief of Carers Trust, says it is estimated that about three in five of us will become carers. She's also concerned about another source of increasing pressure on families. The deepening shortage of professional care staff has led the Care Quality Commission to warn that families face a \"tsunami of unmet need\" this winter. \"We believe that the answer to that is for the government to adequately fund social care,\" Ms Bennett says. She has reservations about the government's pledge of £162.5m to boost the adult social care workforce on top of £5.4bn earmarked for social care: \"It doesn't seem clear how that funding will reach social care and then how it will reach carers.\" Away from the high-level political and economic battle over the care economy, Zoe Wong's everyday battle to balance her mother's needs with her own life carries on: \"My biggest hope for my mum is that she can live out her remaining days with dignity and joy.\" She also wants action to make her own life, and those of other unpaid carers, a lot easier. \"Just because we care for our families doesn't mean we should be taken advantage of. \"Fix the system now, because the issue is only going to continue to worsen.\" ",

The firm said about 1,500 workers at its factories in Trafford and Wrexham and its Salford headquarters would benefit from a number of new measures. They include extra paid leave for those undergoing fertility treatment or staff who suffer the loss of a pregnancy. It said it was aiming to help staff feel \"psychologically safe\" at work.

Under the plans, managers will be trained on how to talk about the menopause and pregnancy loss and paid leave for pregnancy loss will be given without the need for a doctor's note. It also intends to give staff going through fertility treatment three blocks of leave each year as well as access to a private space to administer treatment if necessary. The firm's Europe vice-president in human resources Sam Thomas-Berry said it was \"launching several new workplace policies for even better equity and inclusion\". \"Many people experience these issues, and the impact can be both physical and mental, but they aren't discussed widely in the workplace,\" she said. \"We want to create a culture where people feel psychologically safe, so we'll encourage colleagues to be allies to others impacted by these issues.\" Why not follow BBC North West on Facebook, Twitter and Instagram?

            "content": "Mortgage experts are expecting a \"slow and measured\" increase in the cost of home loans amid predictions of rising prices elsewhere. All eyes turn to the Bank of England which will consider next week whether to raise the base rate. Some mortgage lenders have raised their interest rates slightly, after a period of intense competition and ultra-low costs for borrowers. Official forecasters say the biggest mortgage rate rises will be in 2023. The Office for Budget Responsibility (OBR) - the government's official, independent forecaster - said inflation (which measures the cost of living) was likely to speed up to 4% next year. In response, it predicted a rise in the Bank rate next year, and the year after, from its current record low of 0.1%. It said the Bank rate would not be expected to breach the 1% mark, although it could go as high as 3.5% if inflation went above 5%. Surge in house prices predicted to slow\nEight ways the Budget affects you and your money\nWill mortgage costs go up? and other Budget questions Such a change would generally feed through to the interest rates experienced by householders, meaning the cost of mortgages would rise, but returns on savings could get better too. \"Whether base rate rises or not, mortgage rates have started edging upwards as the markets have already priced in a rate rise, and possibly two or three more by the end of next year,\" said Mark Harris, chief executive of mortgage broker SPF Private Clients. Simon Gammon, managing partner at Knight Frank Finance, said: \"The market is now alive with talk that interest rates are set to rise and all signs suggest the best products available are on borrowed time. \"Though any hikes are likely to be slow and measured, this is the lowest mortgage costs are likely to be for some time.\" Some 74% of mortgage holders are on fixed-rate deals, so would only see a change in their repayments when their current term ends\nOf the remainder, 850,000 homeowners are on tracker deals, which usually move in line with Bank rate changes\nThe other 1.1 million are on standard variable rates, often because they have been automatically moved at the end of their fixed deal term. The rate of interest they pay can been changed at any time by their lender, as is often the case if the Bank rate is altered\nWere there to be a 0.25 percentage point rise in rates, this would translate to approximately an additional £26 per month mortgage payment on average for a tracker rate customer and £16 for the typical borrower on an SVR Source: UK Finance Competition in the mortgage market has been intense, particularly in recent months. That has led to historically low mortgage rates. Newly published figures from the Bank of England show that the effective interest rate typically paid on newly drawn mortgages fell slightly to 1.78% in September. There has also been an improvement for first-time buyers unable to offer much in terms of a deposit to mortgage lenders, according to Rachel Springall, of financial information service Moneyfacts. She said competition was still rife, despite \"murmurings of a base rate rise\". \"Away from headline-grabbing low rates, we have also seen notable improvements on deals for those with a low deposit this month, whereas last year, borrowers would have found it hard to find a deal as lenders pulled them due to coronavirus,\" she said. Andrew Montlake, managing director of Coreco mortgage brokers, said: \"It does now look like the era of ridiculously low rates is coming to an end, but we must remember that we are still in a low-price environment overall. \"As the Bank of England weighs up whether to finally raise the rate of interest themselves, there is now a whole generation of borrowers who have never experienced a rate rise of any kind.\" ",

            "content": "Amazon has said it will spend several billion dollars to manage labour shortages and supply chain issues in the run-up to Christmas. The online retail giant said it was doing \"whatever it takes to minimise the impact\" on customers and sellers. Meanwhile, Apple said a shortage of semiconductor chips had cost it $6bn (£4.35bn) in lost sales. The tech giant's boss, Tim Cook, admitted its problems would persist over the festive period. While the technology giant said fourth-quarter sales rose 29% to $83.4bn, they fell short of expectations. Profit rose to $20.5bn from $12.6bn. Mr Cook said it had experienced \"larger-than-expected supply constraints\" in the three months to 25 September and the chip shortage was now affecting \"most of our products\". Amazon said it would have to spend a significant amount of money to manage its own shortages. Chief executive Andy Jassy said Amazon expected to \"incur several billion dollars of additional costs\" as it managed its way through \"labour supply shortages, increased wage costs, global supply chain issues, and increased freight and shipping costs\". \"It'll be expensive for us in the short term, but it's the right prioritisation for our customers and partners,\" he added. Amazon's profits dropped sharply to $3.2bn from $6.3bn in the third quarter to 30 September, on sales 15% higher at $110.8bn. Why Christmas may be stuck in a shipping container\nAmazon offers £3,000 bonuses to attract staff George Godber, fund manager at Polar Capital, told the BBC: \"It shows that these global giants - and they are just vastly huge businesses - are not immune from the problems that every business is facing.\" Businesses across the world have been grappling with shortages and issues with supply chains as economies have rebooted following coronavirus lockdowns. A global chip shortage is causing delays on the production lines of many products - including cars, washing machines, and smartphones - because supply has not kept pace with demand. Surging demand for goods, including those sold by Amazon, has led to increased congestion at ports in many countries, with retailers sounding the alarm bell that deliveries for the holiday season could be delayed. In California in the US, there have been record-breaking queues of container ships outside major ports. Amazon's staffing issues has led to the retailer offering one-off payments of up to £3,000 in a bid to attract staff in UK regions where there is high demand for labour. The firm is hiring for 20,000 positions across its UK network during the festive season amid fears over worker shortages. It also began offering a £1,000 signing-on bonus to recruit permanent staff in some regions in August. Pay for the temporary roles starts at a minimum of £10 per hour, rising to £11.10 in some parts of the UK. In the past, Amazon has faced accusations of poor working conditions both in the UK and the US, where it is the country's second largest employer. Reuters reported Amazon Chief Financial Officer Brian Olsavsky had said worker shortages contributed to inconsistent staffing levels at the company. He said staff became its primary capacity constraint in the third quarter, which he added was having an impact on other areas of the business. ",

            "content": "When 29-year-old twins Oliver and Alexander Kent-Braham decided to reinvent one of the most traditional areas of finance - insurance - all they had to go on was an idea and the foyer of a gym for an office. \"We were all members of Virgin Active gym. It had wi-fi, coffee and a location on The Strand!\" says Oliver. That's where Marshmallow insurance was born, with the help of co-founder and chief technology officer (CTO) David Goaté. They had no capital and no clients but they knew they had a strong idea. Their hunch was right, in September 2021 the company reached unicorn status - meaning it is valued at $1bn (£727m) - making it the UK's second black-founded unicorn firm. Ismail Ahmed's firm, WorldRemit (now Zepz), a digital cross-border payment platform, became the first in August. Oliver says when they conceived their insurtech firm (\"insurtech\" means innovating new products and services within the insurance sector) they wanted to turn the industry on its head. The twins had a conversation with a friend who had recently moved to the UK and kept receiving expensive quotes for car insurance led them to their big question: how do you find reasonably priced insurance if you don't have a UK driving licence? The key was smarter use of technology and data and they are able to specialise in products for \"riskier\" customers - migrants, young people and those with low credit scores. \"If we were going to start again we would look to raise capital sooner, because before you raise capital you don't have the confidence to take the next step,\" says Oliver. \"It was literally Tim Holliday (CEO of Marshmallow Insurance), David, Alexander and myself for nine months. Tim joined our company not taking a salary.\" Their next step was to raise capital. Not an easy feat. \"Venture capitalists hold the keys to starting new companies. You have to have a mutual acquaintance to even speak to many funders and that needs to change,\" says Oliver. Venture capitalist Aileen Lee coined the term \"unicorn\" in 2013\nToday over 800 companies globally have achieved unicorn status, 48% of those are from the US\nThe first black-owned unicorn was designated just a week before Marshmallow\nA 2020 report by Notion Capital shows that just 21% of B2B unicorn tech companies across Europe and the US are led by women The most recent government statistics say black-owned businesses are four times more likely to have their business loan applications rejected than white or South Asian business founders. In 2020, 10x10, a group of early-stage black founders and venture capitalists, found that just 22% of black founders were able to secure funding from venture capitalists for their start-up. \"The first investor to really believe in us was a guy called Bernard Kantor, who was the founder of Investec bank, and no one really believes in you until one person believes in you,\" Oliver. But just getting to this stage puts the Kent-Braham brothers in a rarefied position. Just 6% of small medium enterprise companies in the UK are MEG (minority ethnic group)-led. So how exactly do you create a black unicorn? The twins have always been driven, being offered a scholarship at the prestigious Reed School on the strength of their skill as sportsmen. That drive has carried them to the top of their field, they say. \"We played a lot of elite-level tennis and what we took from that was persistence. I think that is a skill set needed in businesses; no matter if you're knocked down, you need to get up and try again,\" says Oliver. \"We'd always had a bit of an entrepreneurial flair. When we were 12, we were selling golf balls fished out of the lake and that sort of stuff. \"It was through our early 20s where we just got really into kind of the tech world and into FinTech especially, the whole space is exciting, and that's where we then started to think we wanted to start our own tech company.\" But despite BAME communities comprising 14% of the UK population, all-ethnic founding teams received just 4% of all venture capital investments between 2009 and 2019. And further analysis found that 90% of that money went to teams with white entrepreneurs and just 0.24% went to black entrepreneurs. The latest research from KPMG suggests that, thanks to the UK's Covid vaccination programme and a greater business confidence in the post-Brexit environment, global Venture Capital Investment into UK companies has continued to grow, with £6.7bn being invested in the second quarter of 2021. Back at Marshmallow, Oliver Kent-Braham has some advice for anyone looking to set-up a business: \"To begin with, no one believes in you. Your parents say, 'Oh my god, don't quit your job!' They don't want you to take that risk. So take the risk and be bold in your approach. \"Start small, but go after really big problems.\" ",

            "content": "Facebook has changed its corporate name to Meta as part of a major rebrand. The company said it would better \"encompass\" what it does, as it broadens its reach beyond social media into areas like virtual reality (VR). The change does not apply to its individual platforms, such as Facebook, Instagram and Whatsapp, only the parent company that owns them. The move follows a series of negative stories about Facebook, based on documents leaked by an ex-employee. Frances Haugen has accused the company of putting \"profits over safety\". In 2015, Google restructured its company calling its parent firm Alphabet, however, the name has not caught on. What is a metaverse?\nFacebook to hire 10,000 in EU to work on metaverse\nFacebook is making hate worse, whistleblower says Facebook boss Mark Zuckerberg announced the new name as he unveiled plans to build a \"metaverse\" - an online world where people can game, work and communicate in a virtual environment, often using VR headsets. He said the existing brand could not \"possibly represent everything that we're doing today, let alone in the future\", and needed to change. \"Over time, I hope that we are seen as a metaverse company and I want to anchor our work and our identity on what we're building towards,\" he told a virtual conference. \"We're now looking at and reporting on our business as two different segments, one for our family of apps, and one for our work on future platforms. \"And as part of this, it is time for us to adopt a new company brand to encompass everything that we do, to reflect who we are and what we hope to build.\" The company also unveiled a new sign at its headquarters in Menlo Park, California, on Thursday, replacing its thumbs-up \"Like\" logo with a blue infinity shape. Mr Zuckerberg said the new name reflects that over time, users will not need to use Facebook to use the company's other services. The word \"meta\" comes from the Greek word meaning \"beyond\". To an outsider, a metaverse may look like a version of VR, but some people believe it could be the future of the internet. Instead of being on a computer, people in a metaverse might use a headset to enter a virtual world connecting all sorts of digital environments. It is hoped the virtual world could be used for practically anything from work, play and concerts, to socialising with friends and family. Facebook said it intends to start trading its shares under the new stock ticker MVRS from 1 December. The company has had multiple hits to its reputation, with The Washington Post today reporting that Facebook withheld important information about vaccine misinformation from policymakers during the pandemic. It was the latest in a series of stories based on internal documents leaked by ex-employee Ms Haugen to the media. Among other things, the reports have claimed Facebook sat on research that showed Instagram harmed teenage mental health, and struggled to remove hate speech from its platforms outside the US. Mr Zuckerberg has described the reports as a \"coordinated effort to selectively use leaked documents to paint a false picture of our company\". Trying to name a company is difficult. Zuckerberg says he's chosen Meta, because of its meaning in Greek - \"beyond\". It also alludes to the \"Metaverse\", an online virtual oasis that he wants to build. Here's why Facebook, might have a problem with getting everyone to call them Meta. Firstly, the move looks like Facebook is trying to divert attention away from the trove of negative stories hanging around the company. Critics believe Facebook has done this because the brand has become toxic. We've already seen Senators ignore the name change, with one describing the move as \"cosmetic\". Secondly, the \"Metaverse\" doesn't yet exist. Zuckerberg was keen to stress it was a long-term product. So having a name totally unrelated to your main offering is perhaps a little…strange. Almost all of Facebook's revenue comes from advertising from Facebook and Instagram. And thirdly, we know that other Big Tech rebrands have failed. Almost no one refers to Google as \"Alphabet\", the name it rebranded itself to in 2015. What is clear is that running Instagram and Facebook is no longer Mr Zuckerberg's passion. He is interested in creating virtual worlds, that he thinks will transform the human experience. The constant criticism of how he runs his social media companies must be draining. This restructure may give him the ability to focus more on the segments of the company that excite him. The division makes sense in that respect. However, we'll have to wait and see whether people will go along with it. ",

            "content": "The European Commission has opened a competition investigation into Nvidia's acquisition of British chip-design company Arm. The $40bn (£29bn) deal was announced in September. Regulators are concerned Nvidia could use the move to restrict access to Arm's technology, which powers the vast majority of the world's smartphones. Nvidia has promised it will maintain Arm's open-licensing model. UK intervenes in takeover of chip designer Arm\nNvidia takeover of chip designer Arm investigated Officials said the technology giant, the world's largest graphic and artificial-intelligence chip-maker, had offered concessions in an attempt to address its concerns. But the commission said it still had \"serious doubts\" about the deal, which it believes could result in: less choice\nreduced innovation\nhigher prices for consumers \"Our analysis shows that the acquisition of Arm by Nvidia could lead to restricted or degraded access to Arm's IP [intellectual property], with distortive effects in many markets where semiconductors are used,\" European Commissioner for Competition Margrethe Vestager said. When Nvidia swooped on Arm in September 2020, it seemed unlikely the deal would be blocked. After all, this jewel in the crown of Britain's tech industry had already lost its independence in 2016, when its takeover by Japan's SoftBank had been celebrated by the government as a vote of confidence in the post-Brexit economy. But it seems the voices of those who warned that Arm's unique selling point as a neutral vendor serving the whole chip industry would be endangered have been heard. Around the world, regulators are deciding they need to take a look at this deal. The UK government kicked things off by invoking national security concerns, with the Competition and Markets Authority weighing in with an investigation into the impact on innovation. That's also sparked inquiries in Washington and Brussels, while China is worried about American control of this business vital to the emerging internet of things. Nvidia's hard-driving leader Jensen Huang seems determined to see the deal through, but those who were dismayed when Arm was first sold are hoping for another outcome: a return to the stock exchange as a British company. Nvidia said it remained hopeful it could address the regulators' worries and move forward with the acquisition. \"We look forward to the opportunity to address their initial concerns and continue demonstrating that the transaction will help to accelerate Arm and boost competition and innovation, including in the [European Union],\" a representative said. The commission has until 15 March 2022 to decide whether to clear the deal. It is the second investigation being made into the acquisition - the UK's competition watchdog announced its own earlier this year. The chip companies had originally hoped to complete the deal by March next year- but that now looks unlikely. ",

            "content": "Measures introduced since Boris Johnson came to power, including Wednesday's Budget, will increase the UK's tax burden by £3,000 a year per household. according to the Resolution Foundation. The think tank found policies announced by Chancellor Rishi Sunak had boosted incomes by 2.8% for the poorest fifth of households. However, households on middle incomes would take a 2% hit, it added. Mr Sunak said his Budget had \"cut taxes for millions of the lowest-paid\". That claim was challenged by the Foundation's figures. It said the changes to the amount families can keep from their earnings if they are on universal credit only partially offset the effect of withdrawing the £20-a-week boost during the pandemic. On average, recipients would lose £800 a year, it calculated. The £3,000 figure produced by the Resolution Foundation includes business taxes, which are regularly passed on to consumers. Of the 4.4 million households on universal credit, about three-quarters (3.2 million households) will be worse off as a result of decisions to take away the £20-a week-uplift, despite the chancellor's new universal credit measures. But 1.2 million households would be better off by £900 a year than before the Budget. Eight ways the Budget affects you and your money\nBudget 2021: Key points at-a-glance\nRishi Sunak: The taxman takes the strain Responding to the Foundation's calculations, a Treasury spokesperson told the BBC: \"It's misleading to imply that households will immediately face a £3,000 tax hit, because this figure appears to include business and employers' taxes which aren't applicable directly to households. \"The same report shows that the government's policies are set to boost incomes for those at the bottom of the distribution and that higher taxes will mostly impact middle-to-higher income households. \"This government's decisions have been worth nearly £500 per year extra to households on average, and more than £1,000 for the poorest households - and that's before factoring in wage growth, including the rise in the National Living Wage.\" Talking on BBC Breakfast, Mr Sunak said pressures on the economy \"will be with us for a while\", but that the government's plan was working and \"we can face the future with a bit more confidence\". He also said that wages were rising and that he had \"cut taxes for millions of the lowest-paid people\", adding that it was his job to be concerned about inflation and his new fiscal rules were \"how we build up resilience\". Government figures show that when you take account of investment in public services, the average earner has seen improvements worth £500 a year overall. Setting out the Budget on Wednesday, Mr Sunak said his plans were focused on the \"post-Covid\" era and would pave the way for an \"economy of higher wages, higher skills, and rising productivity\". He told MPs the higher tax burden was down to the pandemic. \"Taxes are rising to their highest level as a percentage of GDP since the 1950s - I don't like it, but I cannot apologise for it - it's the result of the unprecedented crisis,\" he said in his Budget speech. He committed to spending increases of £150bn over three years, including nearly £2bn to help schools in England catch up following coronavirus, £6bn to tackle NHS backlogs and £7bn for transport projects. He also announced that the universal credit \"taper\" rate would be cut by 8% no later than 1 December, so that instead of losing 63p of benefit for every £1 earned above the work allowance, the amount will be reduced to 55p. Meanwhile, the National Living Wage will increase next year by 6.6%, to £9.50 an hour. Labour's shadow chancellor, Rachel Reeves, welcomed the increases in spending announced by Mr Sunak, but said there were areas that gave her \"cause for concern\". Highlighting the need for greater investment in education, she told BBC Radio 4's Today programme: \"If we are going to grow the economy sustainably, we have got to invest in our young people. \"Unless we ensure that kids catch up from that missed-out education [during the pandemic], there will be a long-term cost to our economy.\" The Foundation's overnight analysis of the Budget and Spending Review 2021 revealed a deteriorating picture on family finances, with household incomes set to stagnate as a result of rising inflation. \"Higher taxes aren't a surprise, given the UK is combining fiscal conservatism with an ageing society and a slow-growing economy. But it is the end of low-tax conservatism, with the tax take rising by £3,000 per household by the middle of this decade,\" said Torsten Bell, chief executive of the Resolution Foundation. With higher growth, inflation and public spending than previously expected, combined with tax rises already in train, the Foundation warns that the UK could be set for a flat recovery for household living standards. The combined effect of universal credit changes, alcohol and fuel duties, higher council tax, income tax and national insurance delivered a 2.8% boost to the incomes of the poorest households. But middle-income households will see incomes drop by 2% and the richest fifth of households will suffer a 3.1% hit by the middle of the decade, the Foundation warned. In the wider population, wages are set to fall next year after inflation. It means the last decade has been the weakest decade for pay growth since the 1930s. By May 2024, real wages will have grown by just 2.4% since 2008 - compared with a 38% real wage increase between 1992 and 2008. \"The chancellor got some really good news for the public finances yesterday - lower borrowing, because the economy's doing slightly better than we all though six months ago. But good news for public finances wasn't good news for household finances,\" the Foundation's Mr Bell told BBC Breakfast. \"That's because higher inflation that actually helped the chancellor with his borrowing figures is obviously hurting household budgets, and that's why the Office for Budget Responsibility expects household incomes and wages to actually not grow at all in the next year. \"So that's going to be really bad news for everyone worrying about their own budgets.\" ",

He said while his plans do not \"draw a line under Covid\", they will prepare the economy for post-pandemic life. The Institute for Fiscal Studies said disposable incomes were unlikely to rise by much over the next five years. Labour has said Mr Sunak has not done enough to help families suffering from rising food and fuel prices. We asked five people across the UK whether they got what they wanted from this Budget. Ruby Torry, a 23-year-old waitress at Zizzi's restaurant in the Meadowhall shopping centre in Sheffield, lives in Rotherham with her mother. She will see her wages increased after the chancellor announced a rise to the National Living Wage, however, Ruby believes her hourly rate uplift from £8.91 to £9.50 will be \"useless\" because of other rising costs. \"There's no point in them raising wages, because by the time they've raised your minimum wage, with higher national insurance and inflation, you're no better off,\" she said. \"They'll just stand on the pedestals - it's clear they're out of touch and just not bothered.\" Eight ways the Budget affects you and your money\nNo VAT cut to household energy bills in Budget\nBudget boost for science is less than promised Ms Torry was disappointed to see no measures announced to help households cope with rising domestic gas and electricity bills or rising food costs. \"I've not got kids but I can't imagine what its like for single parents now wondering how they're going to cope with all these costs at Christmas,\" she added. Depending on their circumstances, about two million people who are working and receiving universal credit will be better off. However, another two million of claimants will see no benefit because they either do not work or do not earn enough. Michelle Wilson, a single mother from Glenrothes in Scotland, will see no benefit because she is currently trying to find employment. Ms Wilson used to work as a support officer for Fife council, but left her job partly because she struggled with the cost of childcare. She told the BBC it would have been \"helpful\" for the Budget to encourage more flexible working hours to make childcare easier as she is limited to working from 09:00 to 15:00. Ms Wilson said her finances had been challenged after the £20 weekly uplift in Universal Credit was ended on 6 October. \"It's a real worry because the uplift was almost £100 a month, which is my main shop gone now, so it's another big stress,\" she said. \"My kids have been eating healthier with that uplift and it's been a big drop when I'm worried about my gas and fuel bills.\" However, Ms Wilson said the freeze on fuel duty was welcome. Jon Tolley, who runs an independent record shop Banquet Records in Kingston, Surrey, said the decision to temporarily cut business rates for shops, restaurants and bars by 50% was \"probably more than we would have hoped for\". \"The main thing to do is to encourage people to shop independently, it keeps money in the community,\" he said. However, Mr Tolley said there was \"nothing\" in the Budget which he claimed could \"make up for the problems caused by Brexit\". He was also disappointed to hear \"little about climate action and climate change\", but welcomed the increase to minimum wage. \"I want customers and my employees to have disposable income and cash in their pockets, so they can spend it on the High Streets,\" he added. Nick Grey founded Gtech, which makes floor cleaning and garden products and has a turnover of £70m. The firm employs 200 people across the UK and sells more than 22 million products in 19 countries. While Mr Grey thought the announcements on encouraging overseas worker visas and keeping R&D tax credits were good ideas, he said the Budget decisions were \"based on popularity rather than sound future policy\". \"We are now seeing a huge deficit every year which means the country is getting into more and more debt,\" he added. \"To counter this the government have reduced interests rates to 0.1%, conveniently putting the decision with the Bank of England so they are not held responsible for it.\" Mr Grey said a forecasted 4% inflation rate meant that \"in effect, all the responsible people and companies who 'save for a rainy day' are being penalised so that governments can splash public money around to boost their popularity\". Hollie Whittles, digital strategy specialist and HR director at Purple Frog Systems, said the business rates announcement was \"great news\" and will benefit some of her firm's high street customers \"massively\". \"Extra spending and cutting taxes is a really positive move but on flip side it doesn't help our national debt,\" she said. \"We must however ensure that our economy is stable so I support the priorities.\" Ms Whittles said she was \"delighted\" to see that the Research and Development tax credits now included cloud computing costs. \"This is excellent news for my business which specialises in data analytics and for all businesses working in big data,\" she added.

            "content": "Rishi Sunak might liken himself to a reluctant taxman, but his strategic decision has been to spend at the same time as keeping borrowing down, so taxation has taken the hit. There are four big figures that tell the broad story here. The really good news is that unemployment is now forecast to peak at 5.2%. However, a significant spike in inflation to higher than 4%, set to last a year or so, partly reflects rising energy and fuel prices. Meanwhile, taxation as a proportion of the economy at 36.2% is at its highest level since the 1950s Labour Atlee government. And spending as a proportion of the economy, at nearly 42%, is at its highest sustained level since the 1970s. All that leaves the British state under a Conservative government permanently bigger as a legacy of the pandemic. But borrowing at the end of the new forecast is even lower than forecast before the pandemic. And so the big story is that the corporation tax rises from the March Budget, required to shore up public finances after bad forecasts, have been kept as they were, even as those bad forecasts have been reversed. There might have been some room to delay those tax rises or extend the corporation super deduction. But that extra taxation has been kept to be deployed mainly in terms of extra spending. That spending has been sprinkled towards some help with cost of living, and some surgery on the economy to improve skills and long term productivity. Unprotected areas of the public finances forecast for a continuing squeeze have all been topped up. All will now enjoy rising spending. To be clear, the slowing in the rise in unemployment would have been scarcely believable 18 months ago and is the best measure of the pandemic economic rescue plan's success. But before the Budget, I raised the question as to whether, after furlough, the public were becoming used to the idea that the government should solve problems such as rising living costs. Despite the chancellor's protestations of his love for low, tax free-market conservatism, his actions show an attachment to higher tax and spending. With new restraints on the ability to borrow, delivering on lowering this tax burden will require the economy to grow far more robustly than the disappointing rates forecast after 2023 of as low as 1.3%. Small wonder that the chancellor was proclaiming a \"new era of optimism\" for the economy. To deliver on his promises to reverse tax rises, that isn't just a hope, it's a necessity. ",

Despite a swathe of announcements having been released in advance, the measures as a whole will have a significant impact on your finances. This is how the money in your pocket will be affected. If you are working and also receiving universal credit, then you are probably affected by what is officially known as the taper rate. That means the universal credit payment you receive is reduced as you earn more. For every pound earned (sometimes above a base level of earnings known as the work allowance), 63p is automatically deducted from your benefit payment. By reducing that to 55p, the chancellor is allowing people to keep more of what they earn. By raising the work allowance, the same is true. Depending on their circumstances around two million would be better off, but another two million claimants will see no benefit because they either do not work or do not earn enough. It is a significant policy in tackling the rising cost of living which will be brought in \"within weeks\" and no later than 1 December. It comes after criticism of cancelling the £20-a-week universal credit uplift given during the pandemic which had benefitted 5.5 million people. There is plenty of evidence of prices going up in the shops and on bills, with the cost of living expected to rise by 4% over the next year according to official forecasters. There has been a freeze on fuel duty for more than a decade and this will continue for at least another year, as drivers are hit by higher prices at the pumps. About 60% of the price you pay for fuel is tax - a mixture of fuel duty and VAT. However, there were no measures to assist householders with rising domestic gas and electricity bills. Those on minimum wages will receive a significant pay rise in April. For those aged 23 and above the rate - known as the National Living Wage - will go up by 6.6%, as the hourly rate increases from £8.91 to £9.50. There will also be increases in the minimum wage for younger workers. If they also receive universal credit, they could be affected by the taper rate mentioned earlier. National Living Wage for those aged 23 and over: From £8.91 to £9.50 an hour\nNational Minimum Wage for those aged 21-22: From £8.36 to £9.18\nNational Minimum Wage for 18 to 20-year-olds: From £6.56 to £6.83\nNational Minimum Wage for under-18s: From £4.62 to £4.81\nThe Apprentice Rate: From £4.30 to £4.81 How much is the minimum wage? Public sector staff will also receive a pay rise in April when the freeze on wages in place during the pandemic is lifted. How much this amounts to, and whether it equates to more than the rising cost of living, will be decided at later date. The government's official, independent forecasters - the Office for Budget Responsibility - said that real incomes for everyone would typically rise very slowly in the coming years. Household income rises, after taking into account inflation and changes in tax will be no higher than 1.5% a year for each year up to and including 2026. In the year from April 2022, a middle earner's take-home pay will fall by about 1%, or £180 per year, in real terms. Drinking is getting more expensive, with pub chains warning that higher wages and energy costs will mean much higher prices for a pint. However, Mr Sunak announced an overhaul which he described as \"the most radical simplification of alcohol duties for 140 years\", coming into force in February 2023. This will lead to higher-strength drinks going up in price, but lower duty on drinks ranging from sparkling wine to draught beer. There will be no immediate increase in alcohol duties, contrary to what often happens on Budget day. The cost of smoking is rising again, with an above-inflation rise in duty on cigarettes and an 11% rise in duty on hand-rolling tobacco, taking effect within hours. Mr Sunak said he planned to reduce taxes during the rest of this Parliament. Live updates: Reaction to Rishi Sunak's Budget speech\nBudget measures at a glance Although announced before this Budget, two massive tax decisions had already been made that will affect your money in the coming years. In the last Budget, Mr Sunak said the thresholds as which income tax is paid would be frozen at April 2021 levels for five years (although Scotland has different levels). That means pay rises will push more people into higher tax bands. In September, the government also announced employees, employers and the self-employed would all pay 1.25p more in the pound for National Insurance (NI) from April 2022 to fund social care. The cost of a domestic flight ticket could be cut, but very long-haul flights could get more expensive. That is because the chancellor has made changes to Air Passenger Duty - a levy paid by airlines, but ultimately funded by passengers through the cost of their tickets. Many homeowners of high-rise flats have faced crippling costs owing to the cladding crisis, following the Grenfell Tower tragedy. A levy on the biggest property developers of high rises to pay for the removal of dangerous cladding has been confirmed by the chancellor. To help those of the youngest age, there is extra funding for projects supporting new parents. There is also a new UK-wide programme to improve numeracy skills. The chancellor said that individuals with poor numeracy faced up to £1,600 a year in lost earnings, according to the charity National Numeracy. ",

            "header": "Wage rises will put 30p on a pint, says pub chain",
            "content": "The price of a pint of beer will have to rise by as much as 30p to help pay for higher wages and energy costs, one pub company has warned. As the government prepares to unveil its Budget, City Pub Group said price rises were \"the only way forward\". On Monday, the government said the National Living Wage would rise to £9.50 per hour in April for those over 23 years old. Clive Watson, the chain's boss, said this would cost it about £1m a year. Other pub owners echoed Mr Watson's warning, with industry bodies calling for help for the sector. Emma McClarkin, chief executive of the British Beer & Pub Association, said that while increases to the minimum wage and the minimum living rate would be \"welcomed\" by many staff in pubs, it was a further cost increase for pubs who were \"still struggling to recover and face an uncertain future\". \"It makes beer duty, business rates and VAT cuts in the Budget on Wednesday all the more important for the viability of our sector,\" she added. Wetherspoons, however, has announced it will cut drink prices next month on a range of alcoholic and non-alcoholic drinks. Becks bottles and whisky measures will be sold for 99p at some branches. Wetherspoons said prices will be reduced at all of its almost 900 pubs but the discounts will vary. In October, JD Wetherspoon reported a record annual loss after Covid lockdowns saw its pubs shut for 19 weeks. The firm was also recently affected by a shortage of some beer brands, caused by driver shortages due to a combination of Covid and Brexit. Chancellor Rishi Sunak's latest Budget, to be delivered later, comes as the pub trade is still recovering from lockdown measures imposed during the coronavirus pandemic. City Pub Group weathered the financial storm thanks to government assistance, putting 99% of its staff on furlough during the pandemic. \"That's basically kept the industry on life support, but we're coming off life support now and we need to be able to have a road to recovery,\" Mr Watson told the BBC. Last month, the group, which owns 45 pubs, reported that sales had been above 90% of pre-pandemic levels since Covid restrictions were eased in May. But now it faces further challenges - not just minimum wage rises, but also higher energy and food costs, as well as employers' national insurance contributions going up next April. The price of beer \"would probably have to go up by 25 to 30p a pint\" to take account of all that, Mr Watson said. \"We want to do our bit - it's very important, but at the same time we don't want everything going up the whole time, because all that will do is stoke inflation,\" he added. UK inflation is expected to rise above 4% by the end of this year. Minimum wage for 23 year-olds to rise to £9.50\nPremier Inn owner warns of staff shortages\nNo VAT cut to household energy bills in Budget\nInflation likely to hit 5%, warns Bank economist While Mr Watson said increases to the minimum wage were a \"good idea\", he warned that those increases could be \"gobbled up by other inflationary pressures\". He said a more effective measure would be for the government to cut VAT as a way of reducing the cost of living. The hospitality industry currently benefits from a reduced VAT rate of 12.5%, but that is due to revert to 20% in April. Kate Nicholls, chief executive of the trade group UK Hospitality, said the VAT tax rise would be \"unsustainable\" and mean that businesses would have \"no option\" but to pass the cost on to customers. \"We are facing into considerable headwinds with a bubble of inflationary pressures coming through the supply chain, as well as wage rate inflation,\" she added. Costs 'inevitably' passed on. Martin Greenhow, managing director at Mojo, a chain of six pubs in the north of England, said supply chain costs were \"certainly putting pressure\" on the business. \"If costs go up, prices go up, it's fairly inevitable,\" he said. All of the 89 staff the firm employs are currently on or above the National Living Wage. \"The coming increase will of course affect everyone, as those above it will also expect to see a pro-rata increment which will cost the business thousands,\" he explained. Mr Greenhow said that these staffing and supply costs would \"inevitably be passed on to the consumer\". \"Furlough and grants helped us survive, but essentially our survival was achieved by huge borrowings, which represent another cost to the business and therefore another inflationary driver.\" Ian Ridley runs three pubs and the majority of his 50 staff earn the National Living Wage. \"Something's got to give, we cannot absorb these cost pressures,\" he explained. Although he has not worked through the cost projections for next year yet, Mr Ridley estimates the price of a pint could rise by 20p. \"When we're trying to encourage customers to come back and we're compete with supermarkets on booze, higher prices are not going to help us,\" he told the BBC. The wage increases will mean an estimated £20,000 of extra costs, in addition to higher food, transport and brewery bills. Rising energy costs are causing concern and Mr Ridley said the VAT hike in April and business tax rates were another \"huge worry\". ",

            "header": "CEO Secrets: Rich Lesser of BCG shares his advice",
            "content": "Rich Lesser, head of global firm Boston Consulting Group, thinks CEOs of large companies exist in a \"bubble\". He explains why he had to burst his own in order to grasp the importance of climate change, for our business advice series, CEO Secrets. Boston Consulting Group (BCG) is a management consultancy firm employing more than 22,000 people in offices dotted around the world, with annual revenues of more than $8bn. Rich Lesser joined it straight out of graduate business school in 1988, after training as a chemical engineer, and spent a quarter of a century rising up the ranks. He became CEO in 2013, a role he stepped down from at the end of this September, to become global chairman. Mr Lesser explains why \"CEO bubbles\" form. Check out more of the BBC's business stories from the COP26 summit \"When you're at the top of the hierarchy, you have a lot of influence over people's careers. There is a natural tendency for people to start to say things that they think you want to hear, that align with your world view, or make you happy.\" The bubble forms slowly, Mr Lesser explains, because at first your peers still see you as something of an equal, they know you and your background. But over time, he says, a \"gap starts to emerge\", between the CEO and everyone else. As a result CEOs need to proactively create environments where meaningful debate is fostered. \"I try to celebrate someone when I am wrong and they are right,\" says Mr Lesser, \"that's how you break the bubble\". An example of this is climate change, he says, which he admits he was slow to grasp the importance of when it came to changing his firm's own culture and practices. \"We were already acting to address climate change but not as boldly as we needed to, and I had partners in BCG who pushed back very strongly on me, educating our broader partnership.\" One senior partner in Germany even took matters into his own hands, sending an internal, group email with a self-made video warning of the dangers of inactivity on climate change. It was potentially awkward for Lesser to take a clear stance on this issue, since BCG has big clients in the oil industry, not to mention the political implications in the United States, especially during the Trump administration. \"But those partners [who challenged me] turned out to be right,\" says Lesser, \"it changed our trajectory and helped me break through my bubble.\" A chance factor that helped to change BCG's trajectory was in fact the Covid-19 pandemic, which forced the firm to re-think its traditional working models, in a way that helps meet climate targets. Management consultants and the multinational corporations they serve are known to be some of the worst offenders when it comes to carbon emissions, due to their business travel. Before the pandemic, consultants would typically crisscross the globe on red-eye flights to hold short face-to-face meetings with clients. \"It used to be one of the hardest lives, because they'd be sometimes in two or three continents a week,\" says Mr Lesser, \"but we Zoom from one place to the next now.\" As well as being greener, this means clients can access a variety of expertise more easily, he argues. Last September, BCG committed to reducing greenhouse-gas emissions by cutting full-time employees' travel by 30% by 2025. It has also pledged to cut its net carbon emissions to zero by 2030. Since breaking his bubble, Lesser has joined the World Economic Forum's Alliance of CEO Climate Leaders. He will be attending the COP26 talks in Glasgow in early November. So what tangible results would he like to see, from what's seen as a crunch conference? \"We never get as far as we would ideally want, it's just too hard politically,\" says Mr Lesser, \"but it's not a zero or a one hundred game.\" An acceleration of the national commitments to reduce the carbon output of the global economy, with extra help for developing countries to adapt, is necessary, he reckons. But he would also like politicians to give clear directions to large businesses as they seek to reduce their carbon emissions. \"I'd like to see a price on carbon, it's an externality that should be priced for, that will make it easier for companies to make investments and commit and go faster.\" And he would like to see protection for companies that commit to change. \"Companies that go first are nervous, rightfully nervous,\" says Mr Lesser. \"They will make these big investments and they are going to be left holding the bag because customers are not going to be ready to pay more for products. \"So we need to be able to protect these first movers through some sort of border adjustment mechanisms, or other ways to prevent the punishing of the companies that are bold and invest.\" \"It's an incredibly important conference, but I don't think any of us know whether in the end we will look back on it as a great success or something that came up short of what we need.\" As he steps down as BCG's CEO after more than three decades with the company, succeeded by Christoph Schweizer, Mr Lesser notices a change in the mindset amongst the newest recruits - something apparent in other companies too. The new generation wants a clear sense of purpose from businesses, to give meaning to their working lives, says Mr Lesser. \"They want clear intent of what you are trying to achieve in the world, with real life examples, and you have to animate them. That's very different to even a decade ago, when most companies had a shareholder value mindset that, unfortunately, too often translated into short-term performances.\" To harness that energy, other CEOs may be forced to burst their bubbles.

            "content": "Attempts by Matthew Moulding's THG to appease concerns over trading and corporate governance have sparked another dive in the share price. The online beauty retailer and software firm, which owns Lookfantastic, posted a positive trading update and said it was seeking an independent chairman. But a shares sell-off that started this month continued on Tuesday with the price down another 20% at 239p. THG, formerly The Hut Group, floated on the stock market at 500p a share. The price rose as high as 600p on the first day of trading in September last year. On Tuesday, THG confirmed it had hired recruitment firm Russell Reynolds to find an independent non-executive chairman as part of plans to move the firm to a premium listing on the London Stock Exchange. The Manchester-based company, whose brands include make-up firm Illamasqua, supplements business Myprotein and the recently acquired Cult Beauty, also appointed Andreas Hansson to the board. He is managing director at Japan's SoftBank, which owns about 10% of THG. Hut Group boss dumps 'golden share' in overhaul\nBillionaire UK beauty boss in US expansion Last week, it was announced that Mr Moulding, THG's founder, chief executive and chairman, would relinquish his \"golden share\" in the company which stopped it from being included on London's FTSE indices and enabled him to block a takeover of the business. That followed a meeting with shareholders the week before, when concern was expressed about THG's structure and the prospects for Ingenuity, a technology platform it hopes to license to other online retailers. After that meeting, the company's shares tumbled by 35%, wiping at one point £2bn off the value of the business. On Tuesday, alongside news of executive moves, THG announced that group revenues had increased by 38% to £507.8m in the three months to September on the same quarter last year. It also raised revenue growth expectations for Ingenuity. Mr Moulding said: \"We have delivered a strong trading performance in third quarter and enter our peak trading period with confidence. \"The appointment of two independent non-executive directors and four special advisers since IPO has been hugely beneficial to the board, and we have real optimism for 2022 with the step up to a premium listing on the main market of the London Stock Exchange, following the appointment of an independent chair,\" he said. JP Morgan Cazenove analysts said in a research note that \"all in all, some steps [are] clearly in the right direction\", but warned that Ingenuity needs to find more clients \"to restore confidence\". Mr Moulding and his wife Jodie were ranked 78th on this year's Sunday Times Rich List with a £2.1bn fortune. ",

            "header": "Budget 2021: What is it and when will it happen?",
            "content": "On Wednesday, Chancellor Rishi Sunak will unveil his Budget. He'll say how much of our money the government will take in taxes, and what they will spend it on. Each year, the chancellor of the exchequer - who is in charge of the government's finances - makes a Budget statement to MPs in the House of Commons. It outlines the government's plans for raising or lowering taxes. It also includes big decisions on what the government will spend money on - including health, schools, police and other public services. The Budget speech will be delivered on Wednesday 27 October. It usually starts at about 12:30 UK time and lasts about an hour. Labour leader Sir Keir Starmer will give his response straight afterwards. This year's Autumn Budget is unusual for two reasons: It's the second of the year - there was a Budget in March too\nIt comes on the same day as the results of a spending review, which details how government will fund public services for the next three years After the speech, the independent Office for Budget Responsibility (OBR) - which monitors government spending - will publish a report on how the economy is doing. The Budget is likely to include help to support businesses and individuals recover from the economic effects of Covid. A number of measures have been announced in advance of the Budget, including a rise in the minimum wage from £8.91 per hour to £9.50 and an end to the public sector pay freeze. The chancellor will likely set out some more details of the government's long term ambitions: Reducing the UK's net greenhouse emissions to zero by 2050 to combat climate change\nLevelling up - bringing jobs and investment to the poorer regions of the UK. Budget 2021: What has already been announced? Measures such as the furlough scheme - which finished at the end of September - were expensive, and government income is down because it collected less money in tax during the pandemic. To close the gap between higher spending and less money, the government has had to borrow more. In the year ending April 2021, the government borrowed £320bn - the highest figure seen outside wartime. Economists expect it to borrow around £180bn more this year, another enormous sum. During his Budget speech, the Chancellor will set out the latest borrowing forecasts for the years ahead. Where does the government borrow billions from? The government needs to cut the gap between what it spends and what it raises. One major tax rise was announced in September - the £12bn Health and Social Care Levy. This broke a promise the Conservatives made at the last election, not to raise the three biggest taxes - income tax, national insurance and VAT. There has been speculation that graduates may be asked to start paying back student loans earlier. At the same time, the cost of living is rising. So the chancellor may want to cut some taxes, such as the amount of VAT pay on energy bills. He is also expected to announce major changes to the complicated alcohol tax system, which could see sparkling wine become cheaper. Six things that could affect you in the Budget\nWhy is the cost of living going up? Overall government spending will rise next year, with big increases already announced for health and schools in England. The government has already said that the NHS in England will receive an extra £5.9bn to help clear the record backlog of people waiting for tests and scans. But other government departments, such as courts, prisons, local government and transport, are braced for cuts to their day-to-day budgets next year. They have already faced a decade of tight spending, and making further cuts will be painful. Some parts of the Budget, such as defence spending, affect the whole of the UK. Others, such as education, only affect England. This is because Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland make their own decisions. Scotland has income tax-raising powers, which means its rates differ from the rest of the UK. The Scottish government will publish its Budget on 9 December. If the government announces extra spending on areas that only affect England, the other nations get an equivalent extra sum of money to spend as they choose, according to a rule called the Barnett formula.

            "content": "Workers and occupations hardest hit by the pandemic saw the biggest rebound in pay in 2021, official figures show. Employees aged under 21 and those in low-paid work saw the sharpest dip and recovery, according to the Office for National Statistics (ONS). A revival in pay rates for men has meant the gender pay gap has widened. Chancellor Rishi Sunak is facing calls from unions to give public sector workers a significant rise when a freeze on pay is lifted. \"We need a proper plan from the chancellor [at the Budget] to get pay rising across the economy,\" said TUC general secretary Frances O'Grady. \"That means a pay rise for all public sector workers that at least matches the cost of living. If Rishi Sunak does not increase department budgets the pay freeze will be over in name only.\" The ONS figures show median weekly pay for full-time employees was £611 in April 2021, representing a 4.3% increase from the same month in the previous year. However, the change was far more dramatic for certain sections of the workforce, owing to furlough and other effects of the Covid crisis. For example, employees aged 16 and 17 saw pay drop by 11.4% in 2019-20, before growing by 12.5% the following year. Construction workers saw weekly pay go up by 16.8% in 2021 compared with a fall of 10.4% a year earlier. Manufacturing employees benefited from an 8.3% increase after a 3.1% drop previously. There were also significant regional differences, with gross weekly earnings up by 8.8% in Northern Ireland, compared with a 1.1% rise in London, in 2021. Starter salaries rise at fastest rate in 24 years\nThe future of the office Nicola White, head of earnings at the ONS, said: \"After virtually flatlining last year at the start of the pandemic, earnings are returning to something like their long-term trend over the last few years. \"Increases this year were most marked for the groups worst affected in 2020, such as younger people, men and those in lowest-paid jobs.\" The impact of the pandemic was different for men's pay compared with women's earnings, primarily due to furlough. The recent rebound in pay for many men resulted in a worsening of the gender pay gap between male and female earners. In April 2020, the gap was 7%, but it was 7.9% in April this year, following previous improvements. \"This isn't a reversal of the trend, it is a bump caused by the pandemic,\" said Sarah Coles, senior personal finance analyst at investment firm Hargreaves Lansdown. \"When the 2020 study was carried out, more men were furloughed, and half were on temporarily lower pay, so the gap looked smaller than it actually was. When the 2021 study was done, the position was reversed, so it looked larger than it really was.\" Ms Coles said the gender pay gap was affected significantly by how people lived their lives and brought flexibility of work into sharp focus. \"Children make an enormous difference, but the gap doesn't widen when women take time off with their first newborn, at the average age of 31. It is later, when they reach 40, that it opens up, so the relationship between pay and parenting is more complicated,\" she said. ",

            "content": "Ikea is buying the former flagship central London store of Topshop for £378m following the collapse of Sir Philip Green's retail empire. The Swedish giant will turn several floors of the huge Oxford Street site into a furniture store as part of a strategy to open inner-city outlets. The 239,000 sq ft retail and office space, on seven floors, also houses NikeTown and Vans, who stay as tenants. Ikea said despite the growth of online sales, bricks and mortar remained key. Peter Jelkeby, retail manager of Ikea UK & Ireland, said societies were seeing big changes in the way people live and shop, including soaring online sales and a desire for more local physical outlets. Ikea, famous for its huge out-of-town warehouses, has been trialling inner-city formats across Europe for more than two years. \"Even though online shopping continues to accelerate at a rapid pace, our physical stores - large and small - will always be an essential part of the Ikea experience,\" said Mr Jelkeby. \"Bringing Ikea to the heart of Oxford Street is a direct response to these societal shifts and an exciting step forward in our journey to becoming a more accessible.\" The new store is planned to open in autumn 2023 and will focus on home-furnishing accessories, with the full range available to buy for home delivery. The company opened its first inner-city outlet in Paris in 2019. It also has city centre sites in New York, Toyko, and Madrid, with outlets planned for Vienna, Barcelona, Berlin and Prague. Ikea currently has 22 UK outlets. A conditional purchase contract for the property is now signed, with the final details expected to be completed in January. ",

            "content": "The boss of Heathrow Airport has warned air traffic may not recover completely until at least 2026 despite signs of huge pent up demand for travel. John Holland-Kaye told the BBC that Britain's busiest airport was still making losses even though international travel rules were easing. He also hit back at the aviation regulator for limiting a rise in what it charges airlines for using Heathrow. Airlines at Heathrow make a good return and investors want the same, he said. Mr Holland-Kaye said the airport was still only seeing passenger traffic at around 45% of 2019 levels. \"It's definitely been a tough 18 months but we are starting to see the recovery coming through,\" he told the BBC's Today programme. \"Now all we need to see is stability in the travel rules, so people are confident of what we need to do and the airlines can build it into their systems.\" The airport has faced criticism about long queues and its ability to cope with a growth in passengers. But he said: \"We are hiring people right now to make sure that across the airport we can meet the demand that is starting to come through. \"We're still at around 40% to 45% of the levels even on the busiest days of where we were back in 2019.\" Among the job vacancies Heathrow is trying to fill are security staff and engineers to help maintain the airport. Any shortage of passport control staff, which has lead to headlines about long queues, is the responsibility of Border Force, which is part of the Home Office. Mr Holland-Kaye said it was important the airport and its investors could raise money to help finance that return to growth. At present, the airport can charge up to £22 per passenger for the cost of operating terminals, runways, baggage systems and security. It wanted that to rise to as much as £43 in January, but the Civil Aviation Authority (CAA) now says it will be capped at £24.50 to £34.40 for five years. Heathrow passenger charge to be curbed\nAirport arrivals hit by passport gate failure Mr Holland-Kaye said: \"The CAA's initial proposals do not go far enough to ensure that investors can achieve a fair return, which is key to securing future private investment in passenger service and resilience for Britain's hub airport.\" The London airport said passenger numbers in the third quarter recovered to 28% and cargo to 90% of pre-pandemic levels, although it has lost £3.4bn cumulatively since the start of the pandemic. Heathrow, which last year lost its crown as Europe's busiest hub to Paris, has suffered heavy losses during the pandemic and had been hoping it could claw back some money by raising its charges to airlines.

            "content": "Facebook has posted better-than-expected profits for the third quarter, as it continues to face bad press over leaked internal documents. The social media giant made $9bn (£6.5bn) of profit in the three months to September, up from $7.8bn last year. However, it was hit by a new privacy update to Apple's iOS 14 operating system, which made it harder for brands to target ads at specific users. It comes amid fresh claims of unethical behaviour made by a former employee. Frances Haugen has released a cache of internal documents to the public, alleging that Facebook put profit before user safety. Multiple media reports say the documents show Facebook struggled to moderate content that promoted hate speech and sex trafficking outside of the US. On Monday, Facebook chief executive Mark Zuckerburg told investors on a conference call: \"What we are seeing is a coordinated effort to selectively use leaked documents to paint a false picture of our company.\" In the 12 months to 30 September, the social media giant said its monthly user-base had grown 6% to 2.91 billion. However, despite its strong profits, its revenue slightly undershot analyst expectations, amid \"headwinds\" caused by Apple's privacy rules. Facebook said the privacy update would also have an impact on its digital business in the final quarter of the year, but that it expected to adjust to the changes in time. The firm said it would spend some $10bn on its metaverse division this year - known as Facebook Reality Labs - which is tasked with creating augmented and virtual reality hardware, software and content. Facebook is making hate worse, whistleblower says\nFacebook under fire over secret teen research The world's largest social media network is under scrutiny from global lawmakers and regulators, including from the Federal Trade Commission, which has filed an antitrust lawsuit alleging anticompetitive practices. The whistleblower documents, which were first reported by the Wall Street Journal, have only intensified that pressure. They include internal research about Instagram's effects on teen mental health; whether Facebook's platforms stoke division; and the social media giant's handling of the 6 January Capitol riot. At a hearing on Monday, Ms Haugen told UK MPs that Facebook is \"unquestionably making hate worse\". She said Facebook safety teams were under-resourced, and that \"Facebook has been unwilling to accept even little slivers of profit being sacrificed for safety\". The MPs are considering what new rules to impose on big social networks under the planned Online Safety Bill. But on his conference call, Mr Zuckerberg hit back: \"Good faith criticism helps us get better, but my view is that we are seeing a coordinated effort to selectively use leaked documents to paint a false picture of our company. \"The reality is that we have an open culture that encourages discussion and research on our work so we can make progress on many complex issues that are not specific to just us.\" Despite the allegations, shares in Facebook climbed by 1.3% in after hours trading on Monday. The firm's stock is up by about 20% so far this year. ",

            "content": "Tesla surpassed a market value of $1 trillion on Monday, making it the fifth such firm to reach the milestone. Shares in the electric carmaker climbed 12.6% after it struck a deal to sell 100,000 vehicles to the car rental firm Hertz. Tesla has been the world's most valuable carmaker for some time, but brands like Ford and GM make more cars. Previously only Apple, Microsoft, Amazon and Google-owner Alphabet have reached a $1tn valuation. For years, Tesla struggled to ramp up production of its cars, leading some investors to speculate it would fail. But last year the company, led by billionaire Elon Musk, upped its game and became profitable for the first time, prompting its shares to take off. Following the jump in its share price, Mr Musk's 23% stake in the business is worth around $230bn. The deal with Hertz is the biggest-ever rental car order for electric vehicles and seen as a further vote of confidence. Tesla withdraws self-driving beta after problems\nTesla profit surge driven by record car deliveries\n'I'm just not ready to buy an electric car' Hertz will pay $4.2bn for 100,000 Model 3s over the next 14 months, which amounts to about a fifth of its fleet. The rental firm will also build a network of charging stations. Teslas have a range of about 350 miles per charge, but there is a dearth of charging infrastructure in the US - something the Biden administration hopes to change. \"Electric vehicles are now mainstream, and we've only just begun to see rising global demand and interest,\" said Hertz interim boss Mark Fields. By Michelle Fleury, New York business correspondent Tesla has just won major bragging rights. Only a handful of American publicly traded companies have managed to achieve $1 trillion or more in market capitalisation and they are all technology companies. Think big names like Apple, Microsoft, Alphabet and Facebook. Amazon joined this elite club in January last year, 23 years after becoming a public company. In comparison, it took the electric carmaker headed by Elon Musk just 11 years. What makes Tesla's achievement all the more remarkable is that it is the first carmaker to hit this milestone. Tesla is now worth as much as the combined market cap of the nine largest carmakers around the world, including automotive giants like Volkswagen and Toyota. Yet Tesla makes up less than 1% of global car sales. Elon Musk and company are being rewarded for anticipating the future direction of the industry. While Tesla may be a car company, Wall Street treats it - and values it - like a tech company. Tesla produced around 500,000 cars in 2020 - far lower than the likes of Volkswagen which made 9.3 million, Toyota's 7.2 million vehicles and the Renault-Nissan-Mitsubishi Alliance which manufactured 6.8 million. However, Mr Musk has set an annual sales growth target of 50% and eventually hopes to reach 20 million vehicles a year. On Monday, it emerged that Tesla had withdrawn its latest update of Autopilot, the \"full self-driving\" car software, after drivers complained of problems. Some drivers reported intermittent issues such as safety alerts sounding, despite no danger being present. The firm has not said when the driver assistance software will be re-released. In August, the US National Highway Traffic Safety Administration opened a formal safety probe into Autopilot system, which is in 765,000 US vehicles. The investigation follows a series of 11 crashes involving Tesla models and emergency vehicles since 2018. ",

            "content": "The online travel agent On the Beach has launched legal action against Ryanair in the High Court. It claims the budget airline has tried to prevent it from booking seats on flights on behalf of its customers, as well as making its customers go through costly and onerous check-in procedures. The two sides have previously been at odds over refunds for flights cancelled during the pandemic. Ryanair has yet to comment on the claim. On the Beach sells package holidays online via its websites and app. These can include flights with Ryanair, which it says has a dominant position on many popular short-haul holiday routes, such as from Manchester to Alicante and Lanzarote. Ryanair announces Derry to Manchester flight route\nRefund probe into Ryanair and BA dropped However, it alleges that Ryanair is reluctant for its flights to be sold via third parties, because it makes a considerable amount of its revenue from selling extra services, such as hotel bookings, priority boarding and car hire through its website. Such revenues typically account for more than a third of Ryanair's operating income. Ryanair itself has previously warned customers not to make bookings through online travel agents, on the grounds that they could be overcharged, while the airline might be unable to obtain essential customer contract and payment details. It has accused online agencies of providing it with \"fake email addresses and virtual credit cards\" to complete bookings. In its claim, On the Beach describes such allegations as \"disparaging and untrue\", at least where its own services are concerned. It accepts that it does make a profit on flights sold through its own website, but points out that it operates in a highly competitive industry and as a result its profits are \"constrained to competitive levels\". Ryanair has long had a difficult relationship with online travel agents, which it refers to as \"screenscrapers\". Although they do sell seats on Ryanair planes, it believes they offer inflated fares and divert traffic away from its own website, depriving it of the opportunity to earn money from selling extra services such as priority boarding, car hire and hotel rooms. According to On the Beach, Ryanair has deliberately tried to prevent it from making bookings, for example by rejecting credit card numbers identified as belonging to the agency. It has also accused the airline of withholding refunds for cancelled flights and making passengers who booked through third parties undergo onerous and sometimes costly check-in and verification procedures. It claims Ryanair has breached competition law by abusing its dominant position on popular holiday routes. Ryanair, which has yet to file a defence, has not commented on the claims. ",

            "content": "Major phone networks have agreed to automatically block almost all internet calls coming from abroad if they pretend to be from UK numbers, Ofcom has confirmed. Criminals have been using internet-based calling technology to make it look like a phone call or text is coming from a real telephone number. Almost 45 million consumers were targeted by phone scams this summer. Ofcom said it expected the measures to be introduced at pace as a \"priority\". So far, only one operator - TalkTalk - has implemented the new plans. Other phone networks are still exploring methods of making it work. Why phone scams are so difficult to tackle\nNearly 45 million had scam calls in three months\nDelivery text scams and how to deal with them \"We've been working with telecoms companies to implement technical solutions, including blocking at source, suspicious international calls that are masked by a UK number,\" said Lindsey Fussell, Ofcom's networks and communications group director. \"We expect these measures to be introduced as a priority, and at pace, to ensure customers are better protected.\" She added tackling the phone scams issue was a \"complex problem\" that required a coordinated effort from the police, government, other regulators and industry. The move follows months of discussions between Ofcom and the UK telecoms industry. Internet-based calling technology, also known as Voice Over Internet Protcol (VoIP), is used by millions of consumers globally to make phone calls free or cheaply every year. Popular services that use this technology include WhatsApp, Skype, Zoom and Microsoft Teams. The Sunday Telegraph, which first reported the story, cited Whitehall sources that have cast doubt on Ofcom's plans. They say blocking traffic from foreign VoIP providers will not work to stop scam texts and calls, because much of the UK still relies on old copper-based networks dating back to the 1970s. But some experts the BBC spoke to disagree. Apart from consumers, many businesses also use the VoIP technology for internal corporate phone networks. Whenever a corporate phone network makes a call, a VoIP provider hands over the call from the internet to the phone networks. Gabriel Cirlig, of US cyber-security company Human, said telecoms companies were not inspecting the traffic they received from VoIP providers, they just let it through on to the network. \"Recently, because of the ease in implementing your own private-enterprise telephone system, everybody can have access to critical telephone infrastructure,\" Mr Cirlig said. \"Because of this lower barrier of entry, it is very easy for scammers to build their own systems to spoof mobile numbers - the cyber-criminals are essentially pretending to be legitimate corporate telephone networks in order to have access to legitimate telco infrastructure.\" He adds that right now, it is up to the VoIP provider to check whether the calls it is handing over to telecoms networks are actually legitimate. \"This is not a regional problem or restricted to one type of infrastructure, this is a systemic issue that allows crime to cross any borders,\" said Mr Cirlig. \"This feature is enabling the VoIP business model so they don't want to stop it.\" Matthew Gribben, a former consultant to GCHQ, the UK government intelligence agency, agrees. He used to see many scams while monitoring networks for GCHQ. \"It's fundamentally the foreign VoIP providers that are technologically enabling these gangs to operate, so it will make a huge dent in this,\" he said. \"It doesn't fix everything but it's an excellent step in the right direction.\" Experts agree that the only way to completely fix the problem is to implement new telephone identification protocols that enable phone networks to authenticate that all calls and text messages actually come a real telephone number. The new protocols, known as \"Stir and Shaken\" in a nod to James Bond, were developed by an international standards body, the US-based Internet Engineering Task Force. US authorities have ordered mobile operators to implement the protocols by the end of 2021, but Ofcom told the BBC in August that introducing full authentication in the UK would only be possible when the technology that supports voice services is upgraded, which is due to be completed by 2025. The Body of European Regulators for Electronic Communications said that it cannot impose Stir and Shaken on EU phone networks. It is only able to ask mobile operators to block, on a case-by-case basis, access to numbers or services in case of fraud. However, it said it was now discussing whether to implement the protocols.

Elementary energy: The case for hydrogen\nAberdeen zone funds to help green energy transition A study commissioned by the council has estimated that if the hydrogen hub enables the export of renewable hydrogen then 700 skilled jobs could be created within less than 10 years. The Aberdeen Hydrogen Hub programme's first phase involves delivery of a green hydrogen facility and is targeting first operations from 2024. Aberdeen City Council leader Jenny Laing said: \"This is a huge announcement for Aberdeen. \"It paves the way for the city to be a world leader in the production of hydrogen-based green fuel and energy.

She said skills built up during more than 50 years of North Sea operations were \"directly transferable to emerging energy industries\". Hydrogen's most likely uses, at least initially, are in heavy industry, and in heavy transport including trucks, buses and rail.

            "content": "Almost £2bn will be invested by the government into building new homes on derelict or unused land in England, the chancellor is expected to announce in Wednesday's Budget. The government said 160,000 greener homes could be built on brownfield land the size of 2,000 football pitches. It also pledged to invest £9m towards 100 urban \"pocket parks\" across the UK. However, concerns have been raised that not enough affordable homes are being built. Nigel Wilson, chief executive of Legal and General, told the BBC's Today programme the £1.8bn investment was the \"right direction of travel\", but was \"not enough scale right now\". He warned people living in smaller cities and towns were being \"left behind\" due to not enough homes being constructed. \"You shouldn't have to be rich to be green,\" he said. \"It's very difficult for poorer people to get on the green (housing) ladder. \"There's a lot of active listening going on (by the government), but we don't just want CGI housing - we want real housing built across the UK.\" The government said the funding was part of its efforts to meet the UK's net zero target by 2050. It hopes the plans will help regenerate parts of England and support 50,000 new jobs. Six things that could affect you in the Budget\nBudget about investing in public services - Sunak The proposals also include creating so-called \"pocket parks\" - measuring the size of a tennis court - to create more green spaces. More than 2.5 million people across the UK currently live further than a 10 minute walk from their closest green space. Tim Farron, Liberal Democrat spokesperson for housing, said people buying new homes would be \"forced to fork out thousands to upgrade their homes in the future to cut their bills and reduce emissions\". \"In his Budget, the chancellor should bring forward new standards for greener homes to ensure all new homes are cheap to heat and produce minimal emissions,\" he said. Zoe Nicholson, Green Party leader of Lewes District Council, said building on brownfield sites made sense, but added the government's investment was an \"absurdly small amount of money\". \"It would be more effective if they handed this £2bn of funding to local authorities, which would allow them to build net zero council homes,\" she said,. \"This announcement seems to be little more than a gimmick intended to distract us from the fact that their agenda is to simply 'build, build, build' on our countryside to the benefit of greedy developers.\" The Labour Party has not responded to requests for comment. As well as funding for new housing developments, the chancellor is expected to confirm £65m to develop new software to help with the digitisation of the town planning system. The first phase will see the system rolled out to up to 175 local authorities in England. ",

            "header": "Petrol prices hit record high, says RAC",
            "content": "Petrol prices have hit 142.94p a litre, their highest level to date, according to the RAC motoring organisation. Fuel prices were last around this level in April 2012. It is now £15 more expensive to fill up an average family car than a year earlier, said the RAC, which called the new high a \"dark day for drivers\". The RAC said the increase was partly due to a doubling of the oil price since last year. Some analysts believe the oil price could rise further. The price of unleaded petrol has jumped by 28p a litre since last October, the RAC said, meaning it now costs £78.61 to fill a family car. \"This will hurt many household budgets and no doubt have knock-on implications for the wider economy,\" a spokesman for the RAC said. The organisation said that other costs, aside from oil, had also pushed up fuel prices. Retailers had increased their profit margins by 2p a litre from around 5.5p in April last year to 7.5p a litre. The RAC said retailers, particularly the smaller, independent ones, were trying to rebuild their profits after the steep fall in sales prompted by the first UK lockdown in spring last year. In addition to this, the ethanol component of unleaded petrol was doubled to 10% last month in the more eco-friendly E10 fuel, but as ethanol is more expensive than petrol, that added about 1p a litre. What is E10 and can my car run on it? Duty paid on fuel is currently 57.95p a litre, more than the cost of the combined bio and petrol components, which amount to around 50p. VAT, currently around 24p a litre, is applied on top of all other elements of the petrol price, including duty and the retailer's profit margin. Petrol and diesel cars are slowly being phased out as part of pledges to tackle climate change. The government says it will ban the sale of these from 2030. The introduction of the E10 fuel as standard this summer is also part of that drive. The Department for Transport says bringing in this new fuel could cut carbon emissions by 750,000 tonnes a year, the equivalent of taking 350,000 cars off the road. ",

The bank said it had sent a letter to TSB owner Banco de Sabadell \"expressing an interest\" in a deal, but that no talks had resulted from it. TSB, which has more than 500 UK branches, was bought by the Spanish bank for £1.7bn in 2015. Sabadell said on Saturday that its board had rejected an offer after Sky News first reported the approach. Reuters reported that Sabadell had replied to the Co-op saying \"this is not a transaction that we wish to explore at this moment as we have previously expressed publicly\". In a statement released on Monday, the Co-op said that \"no discussions in relation to a potential transaction are currently taking place between the bank and Sabadell\". This is the second time the Co-op Bank has expressed an interest in buying TSB. The Co-op Bank, at that time still part of the Co-op Group, made an approach in 2013, but had to abandon the attempt after deep financial problems of its own triggered a £1.5bn rescue by three US investors. A combined Co-op-TSB would have created a bank with eight million customers and about 900 branches. That would still leave it smaller than the existing big four of Barclays, Lloyds, HSBC and NatWest. TSB had been part of Lloyds Banking Group until 2014 when it was spun off as an independent bank. It was then bought by Sabadell the following year. ",

            "content": "Chancellor Rishi Sunak will deliver his Budget and Spending Review to the House of Commons next week, setting out the government's spending and financial strategy. Changes to the national minimum wage could be announced, as those earners have been badly hit by the economic downturn. New climate measures and changes to company taxes are also expected. We asked six people across the UK what they want to see from this Budget. Ruby Torry, a 23-year-old waitress at Zizzi's restaurant in the Meadowhall shopping centre in Sheffield, lives in Rotherham with her mother and earns the minimum wage. \"I'm careful with my bills and don't go silly with shopping, but I want to see the minimum wage go up or national insurance tax come down,\" she told the BBC. Five things that could affect you in the Budget\nWhy is the cost of living going up? Zizzi's had put Ms Torry on furlough, but she said she couldn't cover her bills, so she worked for Asos in the firm's Barnsley warehouse during the pandemic. She says she would also like to see more incentives for apprenticeships. \"I wanted to do an engineering apprenticeship, but wouldn't have been able to live on £800 a month wages - I couldn't even pay for my car on that,\" she explains. \"Minimum wage needs to go up, I don't know how the government thinks we can do anything on that little.\" Michelle Wilson is a single mother from Glenrothes in Scotland and has already felt challenges after the £20 weekly uplift in Universal Credit was ended on 6 October. \"It's a real worry because the uplift was almost £100 a month, which is my main shop gone now, so it's another big stress,\" she told the BBC. She added that she would like to see increases in Universal Credit and the minimum wage to reflect the rise in household costs from inflation. \"My kids have been eating healthier with that uplift and it's been a big drop when I'm worried about my gas and fuel bills,\" she says. Ms Wilson used to work as a support officer for Fife council, but one of the reasons she left the job was because she struggled with the cost of childcare as a lone parent. She said it would be \"helpful\" for the Budget to encourage more flexible hours for working and finding childcare, as she is limited to 09:00 to 15:00. Ms Wilson would support government measures to help with the sharp rise in energy bills, which she said she is \"struggling to keep up\" with, as rising costs are making life \"harder and harder\" for her. Nick Grey founded Gtech, which makes floor cleaning and garden products and has a turnover of £70m. The firm employs 200 people across the UK and sells more than 22 million products in 19 countries. Mr Grey says the Budget should not make it more difficult for firms to employ overseas workers, which he thinks would be a \"backwards step\" amid the labour shortages. Another of his requests is that a rise in corporation tax should be avoided, as he says it \"risks businesses setting up headquarters elsewhere and less bureaucracy would be better for attracting investment in the UK\". Raising tax on high earners also \"risks lowering the overall tax income for the country\", he adds. Jon Tolley runs independent record shop Banquet Records in Kingston, Surrey. He believes the fairest way to pay for the pandemic is through increased tax for people and businesses that earn the most, rather than a rise in everyone's National Insurance tax. \"I want customers and my employees to have disposable income and cash in their pockets, so they can spend it on the High Streets,\" he adds. Mr Tolley explains the business has had an \"OK\" year and received a cash grant of £25,000 twice from the government for having had to close the shop - action that he says was \"welcome and effective\". But he adds that he would like to \"see something changed about business rates\". \"We're in competition with online stores who don't have to pay the same rates and High Street rents, so that playing field needs to be levelled.\" The business pays the standard 20% VAT on products and Mr Tolley doesn't want to see this increase. \"We haven't had 'just-in-time' stock control at all, because of delivery delays, but we're fortunate to have storage capacity and have ordered well ahead for Christmas.\" Hollie Whittles, digital strategy specialist and HR director at Purple Frog Systems, says she wants to see a review of the business rates system. She says small businesses often \"lack the time to understand\" tax and rates. Ms Whittles says it is \"crucial\" to make sure taxes designed for large organisations are not avoided or passed \"further down the chain to their small business customers\". On climate measures, she commends grant schemes such as the Low Carbon Opportunities Programme (LOCOP) and the Business Energy Efficiency Programme (BEEP), which encourage businesses to adopt greener technologies. \"It is vital that the government supports small businesses' journey to net zero, especially with small businesses making up more than 99% of all private sector enterprises,\" she adds. On changes to apprenticeship schemes and student loans, Ms Whittles, who works with 14 staff, says she would welcome more support for small businesses wanting to train and upskill staff in new technologies that help benefit long-term careers and the local economy. Ms Whittles says there have been \"considerable challenges\" in accessing the government's Kickstart scheme, which creates new jobs for 16 to 24-year-olds on Universal Credit. The government should also support schemes and skills investment for older people wanting to change careers, in her view. Lynne Turner is 71 years old and would like to see her basic government pension of £137.60 per week increased. \"It's absolutely not enough. I'm frugal, but couldn't survive with a decent lifestyle if I only had my pension,\" Ms Turner explains. Ms Turner says she could not afford to pay into a private pension in the past because of childcare costs. Without an inherited cottage in Wales, the rent from which supplements her pension, she \"wouldn't be able to manage\", she says. She adds that she would support a beer levy, which \"wouldn't bother her at all\", but says that because so many small businesses have struggled during the pandemic, she would be against making them pay more taxes.

            "header": "Budget 2021: Don’t hit us with more taxes, firms beg chancellor",
            "content": "If government and business were a couple, a guidance counsellor might have been called in by now to repair a strained relationship. This week's budget will be a test to see if the mood music can improve, after a number of fractious years. Relations seemed to hit an all-time low when the prime minister famously dismissed business concerns over the brinksmanship, during the Brexit negotiations, with a four letter expression of his lack of sympathy. Then the argument became more physical. A whopping rise in corporation tax from 2023, from 19 to 25%, reversed at a stroke a decade of Tory business tax policy. The chancellor then raised employers' national insurance contributions by 1.25%, adding £6bn a year to a wage bill that was already rising. Budget about investing in public services - Sunak\nBudget 2021: Five things to look out for Those rising wages were celebrated by the PM at the Conservative Party Conference - Boris Johnson insisted it was evidence that the UK was on its way to higher wage more productive economy. But economists will tell you the productivity gains are supposed to come first. And all this against a backdrop of business feeling they were being blamed for labour, driver and petrol shortages, that have hampered the recovery of many parts of the economy. Meanwhile the government is urging, even expecting, the private sector to lead the UK into greener, more sustainable pastures by investing heavily. As Tony Danker, head of the CBI recently put it: \"You cannot will the ends and ignore the means to turbocharge the economy. \"The government wants business to drive investment and innovation but its tax policy is working in the other direction.\" The government will point to the fact that the businesses that do invest have already been rewarded by the so-called \"super-deduction\" introduced in the March budget. This measure rewards companies that do invest with tax breaks greater than the sum invested - a move that was widely welcomed by business. There is also the small matter that the government spent over £70bn paying 11 million peoples wages at one time or another over the last 18 months. Business tax rises are part of an inevitable payback. It is unlikely that we will see any major changes in direct business taxes - and for that businesses will be grateful. However, they are likely to be disappointed if they are expecting a long-awaited major overhaul of business rates - their biggest and longest held desire. The government may, however, say that green upgrades to premises will not lead to higher rates, as often happens now. When firms improve their buildings, they get sent a higher rates bill under the current system. Business also fears that there may be some backsliding from the government on targets for public spending on research and development. A much anticipated rise in capital gains tax, to be more in line with income tax, will have implications for investors in business. Yet, other business leaders admit the government has a point on highlighting under-investment. Speaking recently at a home builders conference, the boss of Taylor Wimpey, Pete Redfearn, said that the construction industry had been guilty of not putting more of its own money into skills and training. An extra £3bn announced this weekend for skills and extra funding for electric car production in the North East and the midlands was welcomed by business groups. We can expect a heavy emphasis on skills in the chancellor's speech. Business feels that at times it is the victim of gaslighting - where its real and difficult experiences are dismissed as irrational or self pitying, by a government keen to look forward to a time when, hand in hand with industry, it can lead the UK to a greener more prosperous future. As always, there will be talk on both sides of the happy partnership between public and private, but behind the smiles, the strains between business and the government remain very real. ",

            "content": "Rising energy costs are putting \"enormous pressure\" on Scottish firms, and could lead to closures and job losses, business leaders have warned. The Scottish Chambers of Commerce (SCC) said many businesses were finding it impossible to keep pace with energy price rises after Brexit and Covid. Liz Cameron, the SCC's chief executive, called for more support for businesses in Wednesday's Budget. The government said it was monitoring the situation incredibly closely. Dr Cameron has written to UK Chancellor Rishi Sunak to call for the introduction of an energy price cap for small and medium businesses. Is the UK headed for a gas shortage this winter?\nRegulator warns of significant energy price hikes\nWhy are gas prices so high? While there is a price cap for households, there is no such safeguard for businesses, which have to absorb the full impact of rising global energy prices. This year has seen an unprecedented increase in global gas prices, which have risen 250% since the start beginning of 2021. Dr Cameron said: \"In the past few weeks, the UK has reached a crisis point over gas and electricity prices, and businesses are feeling the consequences. \"Many businesses in Scotland are still operating in survival mode and continue to recover from the dual challenges of the UK's departure from the EU and the impact of the global coronavirus pandemic. \"It's impossible for firms to keep pace with these exorbitant rises in energy prices and these cost pressures are putting many businesses under enormous pressure and resulting in these rising cost pressures increasingly being passed on to the consumer.\" She urged the UK government to support business recovery over the winter months. In her letter to Mr Sunak, Dr Cameron said businesses urgently required support to mitigate rising costs, which she said \"threaten recovery and could lead to the permanent closure of businesses and the loss of jobs across Scotland\". According to the Chamber of Commerce, one Scottish hotel group will see a 70% increase on its current yearly bill. The Caithness Collection, which operates three hotels in the north Highlands, has reported a potential rise of £53,170 per year in electricity costs as it moves to a new contract. Andrew Mackay, owner of the hotel group, said: \"The hospitality sector was one of the hardest hit throughout the pandemic and recovery is already proving challenging, with difficulties finding and retaining staff, increased wage demands, other supply chain issues and tax increases. \"Rising energy costs are creating huge burdens and challenges for the business and it's vital that Scotland's businesses are afforded some buffer to guard against energy prices that are hitting them hard.\" A UK Government Department for Business, Energy and Industrial Strategy spokesman said: \"The government is in regular contact with the energy industry and Ofgem to manage the impact of high global gas prices and will continue to monitor the situation incredibly closely, including the impacts for small and medium size businesses.\" A UK Treasury spokesman said: \"The Budget and Spending Review next week will set out how we will continue to invest in public services, businesses and jobs while keeping the public finances on a sustainable footing.\" ",

            "header": "Will Apple be the last US tech giant left in China?",
            "content": "There was a time when the US tech giants were all in China - even Facebook. Today, Apple's huge presence in the country looks increasingly conspicuous. Last week Microsoft, which still operates in China, announced it was to shut down its social network, LinkedIn, there. The company said having to comply with the Chinese state had become increasingly challenging - so it pulled the plug. Apple has its own censorship problems in the country. The BBC reported last week that two popular religious apps had been removed from Apple's App Store. It later emerged that Amazon-owned Audible and the Yahoo Finance app had also been taken down. Apple Censorship, a group that monitors the App Store, says it has seen an increase in apps that have been removed this month. So what is going on? It is notoriously hard to gauge what's happening behind closed doors in Beijing. Still, what is becoming increasingly clear is that Apple and Microsoft are embroiled in a domestic battle between the authorities and the Chinese tech industry. China has its own big tech titans - Tencent, Alibaba and Huawei - that are enormous global companies. But the Chinese government has grown worried about the power they wield. In April, Alibaba accepted a record $2.8bn (£2bn) fine after an investigation found that it had abused its dominant market position\nIn August, the Chinese government unveiled a five-year plan outlining tighter regulation of the tech economy\nIt's also been cracking down on Bitcoin American companies haven't been spared from the \"great tech crackdown\". \"The crackdown suggests that both Apple and Microsoft are very aware that their position is more tenuous than it's been in recent years. They know they need to walk carefully,\" says James Griffiths, author of The Great Firewall of China. The straw that broke the camel's back for Microsoft appears to be a law due to come into force on 1 November - the Personal Information Protection Law (PIPL) - which would have required the company to comply with more regulation. Microsoft alludes to it in a statement explaining its decision to pull LinkedIn: \"We're facing a significantly more challenging operating environment and greater compliance requirements in China.\" Graham Webster, editor-in-chief of the DigiChina Project at Stanford University, said: \"I think they decided it just wasn't worth it.\" Mr Webster links the decision to say goodbye to LinkedIn to forthcoming enforcement of the PIPL. Apple, however, has a different set of priorities in China to Microsoft. It is deeply entangled in the country, far more so than any other US tech company. In the last quarter, Apple made nearly $15bn in revenue in China and Taiwan - an extraordinary figure. Its global supply chain also depends on Chinese manufacturing. And to be in China, Apple knows it has to play by the country's rules - even if that means censorship. You might ask: why doesn't Apple just sell hardware in China, and forget about the App Store? The problem is, Apple believes the App Store and the iPhone are inseparable. It doesn't want to set a precedent of side-loading apps, where people can download apps on an iPhone away from the App Store. For one thing, it would make considerably less money. So if Apple is going to sell products in China, keeping the App Store operational in that country is deemed essential. \"Apple has been removing apps and essentially censoring the App Store in one way or another for years,\" Mr Webster says. Apple executes New Year's Eve apps purge in China\nChina exempt from new Apple privacy features\nApple censors engraving service, report claims\nApple criticised for storing data inside China But Mr Griffiths argues that censorship has slowly grown stricter during Apple's time in the country. \"Apple has set itself a devil's bargain here,\" he says. \"Once you start to agree to remove apps, it doesn't really stop.\" Other companies saw the writing on the wall earlier than Microsoft. Google removed its search engine from China in 2010, after what it said was a Chinese hacking attack. The company said it was no longer happy to censor searches. Rebecca Fannin, author of Silicon Dragons, believes Microsoft's pulling of LinkedIn now makes Apple a \"big target\". But she thinks Apple is going to fight to stay in China. \"You know Apple is really one of the market leaders in China... I don't see Apple pulling out of China over any of these issues any time soon,\" she says. What we don't know are the conversations that are going on behind closed doors between Apple and the Chinese authorities. Perhaps Apple does push back, and maybe many apps are still up and live on the App Store in China because Apple stood up for them. We don't know. Apple rarely comments on these stories, and points journalists to its human rights policy, which states it will follow the laws of the countries it operates in - even if it disagrees with them. And in China, they've been doing just that. When the authorities really want an app taken down, it gets removed. Apple's presence in the country now feels almost like a hangover from another era. Big Tech simply doesn't have much of a presence in China any more. The question now is how much regulation, how much compliance - and how much censorship - is too much? ",

            "header": "Contrails: How tweaking flight plans can help the climate",
            "content": "Those wispy white lines that crisscross the skies after an aeroplane flies overhead are far less benign than their fluffy patterns might suggest. Until now governments and industry have firmly focused on cutting CO2 emissions from aircraft - with good reason, as the aviation sector is responsible for around 2.4% of global CO2 emissions and a single flight can emit as much CO2 as many people do in an entire year. But some scientists are now warning that the impact of radiation caused by aircraft condensation trails (contrails) could even be more significant. Contrails, which heighten the effect of global warming, may account for more than half (57%) of the entire climate impact of aviation. Contrails are water vapour that condenses as ice onto soot particles emitted from aircraft engines. They don't always occur as it requires certain atmospheric conditions: the air must be very cold, humid and \"supersaturated\" for ice to form. They trap and absorb outgoing heat which otherwise escapes into space. This worsens at night when it is colder and the contrail has a longer lifetime. They can also have a less significant cooling effect, blocking incoming sunlight - but only during daytime. Check out more of the BBC's business stories from the COP26 summit Adjust flight routes so aircraft can avoid areas where they form\nTeach pilots how to avoid creating contrails by changing altitude mid-flight\nIntroduce a contrails tax, and give airlines a refund if their flights are contrail-free Contrails can last for seconds, hours or even a day in the atmosphere - and this determines the climate impact of a particular contrail will have. But recent research shows there could be a solution for this overlooked issue. Dr Marc Stettler, transport and environment lecturer at Imperial College London, says changing the altitude of fewer than 2% of flights could potentially reduce contrail-linked climate change by a staggering 59%. \"Tweaking the flight elevation by just a thousand feet can stop some contrails from forming,\" he explains. Adjustments would mean an aircraft could avoid some of the regions of the atmosphere that are cold and humid enough to create contrails in the first place. \"A relatively small proportion of flights contribute to the majority of climate impact. So if we can alter these flights, we can significantly reduce the climate impact,\" says Dr Stettler. Recent research from Prof Christiane Voigt, head of the cloud physics department at Mainz University, Germany, underlines this. She has been conducting trials with the German Aerospace Centre (DLR) to measure and mitigate the impact of contrails. Her team use high-altitude long-range (HALO) G550 research aircraft to gather their data. The aircraft carries wing-mounted instruments measuring contrail properties and the light scattered by radiation. This allows them to evaluate their forecasts' accuracy and investigate the impact of radiation. \"Our results have been really positive. We were able to predict and avoid around 80% of the contrails with little cost,\" she says. Prof Voigt adds that very few flights would have to be deviated to win a \"large climate impact\". While there were some uncertainties, her team were able to track down most of the contrails and avoid the correct areas. \"We are at the beginning of a race to avoid them. And I have the impression that [companies] such as Lufthansa and Airbus, are really interested, as it is low cost and effective,\" she says. Royal Aeronautical Society fellow, Prof Keith Hayward, is optimistic it may only need a software tweak to adjust many flight plans to avoid contrail creation, and that this could be done at a relatively low cost. Compared to the typical $200m cost of a passenger aircraft or engine changes which can run to $12m, a software change is relatively inexpensive, he says. Prof Hayward says the next challenge is for airlines to work out how altitude changes of a \"few thousand feet\" can be made mid-flight to avoid contrails while also not disrupting passengers' comfort. A pilot would need to spot these in \"sufficient time for an aircraft to adapt gracefully\", he adds. But Prof Voigt does not believe this is necessarily a problem. She thinks flight comfort could improve as flight paths would avoid some of the sky's water vapour areas - which both form contrails and cause bumpy turbulence. Raimund Zopp, former pilot and co-founder of Austrian flight services software company, Flightkeys, is working on contrail visualisations to programme into flight plan technology. The company plans to include contrail avoidance in their airline customers' flight plan trajectories by 2023. \"Only a very small portion of flights are causing the problem so you only need to change a few flight plans to have a huge effect,\" he says. As a former pilot, Mr Zopp says that from a flight procedure perspective, adding this information would be easy. \"The flight plans get programmed into the navigation of the plane system, but pilots need training on this new contrail aspect of the flight plan profile\". Any action on climate change that doesn't relate directly to cutting emissions is lower down the priority list for governments and industry, because CO2 is the most important greenhouse gas for most sectors. Yet unlike other sectors, aviation also has very significant non-CO2 impacts. Dr Stettler believes that people have hesitated to reduce contrails by diverting flights because of fears it would be completely unfeasible - that all flights might have to be changed or it would hugely increase fuel consumption. This latest research shows this is not the case. Dr Jarlath Molloy, senior environmental affairs manager at the air traffic service provider, NATS, agrees that up until now, there has been a lack of focus on non-CO2 problems from the entire industry. Yet from an operational perspective, tackling contrails is \"just one extra element the aircraft would have to compute\", he says, and it could even be managed in a similar way to how authorities already orchestrate groups of flights to avoid big winter storms. \"We're exploring the feasibility of it and what we'd have to do to manage flights looking for the same routes\" Dr Molloy adds. The Department for Transport says it is \"currently considering\" a range of responses to its Jet Zero consultation on how to \"make the sector cleaner and greener\", and that this strategy \"will aim to address\" aviation's non-CO2 impact. Meanwhile atmospheric scientist Prof Ken Caldiera, from the Carnegie Institution for Science, makes a compelling case. He estimates preventing most of the damaging climate impact of contrails would cost less than $1bn (£720m) a year and the net value of the benefit could be more than a thousand times that. \"We know of no comparable climate investment with a similarly high likelihood of success,\" he wrote in the scientific journal Nature. So could a financial penalty focus minds in aviation more quickly? Dr Andrew Gettleman of the US National Center for Atmospheric Research says while more research is needed, a contrail tax or avoidance rebate could be introduced if a carbon tax were approved. \"We haven't seen the overall regulatory scheme yet for carbon in aviation, but once we get a larger regime in place for mitigating climate change and reducing carbon - then we can tackle the contrail problem properly.\" ",

            "header": "Second-hand car prices surge amid new car shortage",
            "content": "Second-hand car prices are rising at \"unprecedented rates\", the AA has said, as more people consider buying used cars amid a low supply of new vehicles. Research by the motoring group suggests the price of the UK's most popular cars have increased up to 57% since 2019. Three to five-year-old Ford Fiestas, the most popular on its AA Cars website, were now valued at £9,770 compared to £7,448 two years ago. Industry figures said \"nearly new\" used cars were in particular high demand. Price rises have been driven by a number of factors. A global shortage of computer chips used in car production, as well as other materials such as copper, aluminium and cobalt, has led to fewer new vehicles rolling off production lines. That has meant more buyers turning to the used-car market. AA Cars, which compared the prices of three, four and five year-old cars between 2019 and 2021, said demand for some models was so strong that they are increasing in value with age. Why the banger on your drive is suddenly worth a lot more\nSecond-hand car sales soar amid shortage of new models\nChip shortage could last into 2023, says car boss Analysis from the motoring group's website found the price of a three-year-old Mini Hatch in 2021 was 57% higher (£15,367) than a model of the same age in 2019 (£9,811). Meanwhile, research said the price of a five-year-old Mini Hatch had jumped 15% compared to what a three-year-old model was worth in 2019, meaning the car gained in value despite getting two years older. Audi A3s saw the biggest jump in prices since 2019 (46.09%), followed by Ford Focuses (43.11%), which were the second most popular car on the AA's website. The motoring group said the first easing of coronavirus lockdown restrictions in summer 2020 had \"unleashed demand\" that had been \"pent up\" during the early stages of the pandemic. It said a shortage of new cars for sale led many drivers to buy used rather than new, with \"demand pressures pushing up second-hand prices at unprecedented rates\". James Fairclough, chief executive of AA Cars, said some popular cars were growing in value \"even as they sit on the driveway\". \"With the exception of houses and some classic cars, things rarely go up in value as they age,\" he said. Mr Fairclough said despite the price growth in used cars, it was \"still possible to get a good deal\" if people shopped around. Besides new car supply issues, used-car dealerships have also experienced a shortage of stock as trade-ins have been reduced, according industry figures. The rise of online dealers with large advertising budgets such as Cinch, Cazoo and We Buy Any Car has also changed the market. The used-car price surge along with rising energy, grocery and transport costs has contributed to the UK's higher inflation rate. It has led to the Bank of England warning it \"will have to act\", suggesting interest rates may rise soon. Peter Smyth, director of family business Swansway Car Dealers, told the BBC \"nearly-new cars\" were now a \"desirable product\" because of the slow supply of new ones. He said \"the more expensive cars\" on his forecourts such as Audi Q7s and Land Rovers, were \"selling the fastest\". \"We are selling less cars for more money,\" he said. \"You cannot replace the stock you have got.\" \"We look at our prices of our cars on a daily basis and we move them with the market place.\" Mr Smyth said he expected prices to remain high for the next six to 12 months. He added he had been told by manufacturers that next year was going to be \"tight\" due to the shortage of materials such as computer chips. \"What you will find is manufacturers will have more supply of luxury cars next year than lower end stuff,\" he said. \"They are going to put the chips in the high-value cars where they make the most margin.\" In August, the Society of Motor Manufacturers and Traders (SMMT) said second-hand car sales in the UK had more than doubled. Petrol cars made up most of the sales, with Ford Fiestas, Vauxhall Corsas, Ford Focuses and Volkswagen Golfs being the most popular models. Mike Hawes, SMMT chief executive, said that while a buoyant used-car market was \"important, as strong residual values support new car transactions\", it was \"critical we have a healthy new car market to help accelerate fleet renewal by allowing motorists to replace older, less efficient vehicles with the latest, cleanest models\".

            "content": "Higher prices in the run-up to Christmas have not dulled people's appetites for toys, Barbie maker Mattel has said. The toy giant raised prices after soaring shipping and raw materials costs. The toymaker said its third quarter sales grew 8% to $1.8bn (£1.1bn), and that it expected a strong Christmas. Mattel is working hard to get toys on shelves amid supply disruptions, chief executive Ynon Kreiz told the BBC. Businesses around the world have been dealing with big increases in shipping costs as Covid disrupts ports and containers back up. The toy industry faces these challenges along with other businesses, Mr Kreiz said. \"We were impacted by global supply chain disruptions [in the third quarter],\" he said. \"But we worked through them.\" The rising cost of resin for Mattel's plastic toys also meant price rises for consumers, Mr Kreiz said, although he declined to say how much Mattel toys had gone up by. Mr Kreiz said that parents had prioritised spending on their children. He said whether shipping and raw materials costs would continue to rise was \"volatile and hard to predict\". However, he said that if necessary higher toy prices and cost savings would \"offset the impact of inflation on our business\". Barbie dolls and Hot Wheels cars sold well in the third quarter, while there was 50%-growth in action figures for franchises including Jurassic World and Masters of the Universe. Last week The Entertainer, one of the UK's biggest toy retailers, warned that delays at UK ports could mean shortages this Christmas. A container logjam at ports, including Felixstowe, and a shortage of HGV lorry drivers has sparked widespread concern among retailers about future stocks. Toy shops warn of Christmas shortages amid port delays Mr Kreiz said Mattel is \"doing what we can... to make sure we have presents on shelves\". The company has brought forward production, secured more freight containers, and got access to more ports to keep up supplies, he said. However, he said: \"I can't say we will meet all of the demand.\" But he said: \"We do expect a strong holiday season\" and for parents and children to have \"a happy holiday with lots of toys under trees this Christmas.\" Why Christmas may be stuck in a shipping container\nThe shortages hitting countries around the world Rival Hasbro also said this summer that it aimed to avoid pandemic-related supply chain issues by increasing its shipping capabilities and speeding up the process of sourcing its products. Mattel shares were up 6% in extended New York trading after the earnings announcement. In recent years Mattel has made Barbie more diverse, with dolls based on different role models and professions. This year, the firm launched a doll based on tennis superstar Naomi Osaka. Mattel's products include Polly Pocket, Magic 8 balls, Disney Classics and Fisher-Price brands. The firm began in 1945, as a collaboration between Ruth and Elliot Handler, and Harold \"Matt\" Matson. ",

            "content": "More than 2,000 Amazon warehouse workers in New York City hope to hold a vote to unionise, in the latest labour push at the firm. It's the second organising effort at the online shopping giant this year, and comes amid a pick-up in union activity across the US. The workers, from four Amazon sites in Staten Island, want higher wages, safer working conditions and longer breaks. Amazon said they were free to unionise but it was not the \"best answer\". The employee group, called the Amazon Labor Union (ALU), said it will file a petition to the National Labor Relations Board on Monday, asking it to formally allow a vote. So far more than 2,000 workers have signed the petition, out of a total of 7,000, meaning they roughly meet the required threshold. At least 30% of workers have to sign for a vote to proceed. \"Workers are demanding Amazon to stop their union-busting practices and allow workers to use their rights to organise towards collective bargaining without interference,\" the ALU said in a statement. \"We intend to fight for higher wages, job security, safer working conditions, more paid time off, better medical leave options and longer breaks.\" 100,000 workers take action as 'Striketober' hits the US\nNew York sues Amazon over 'deficient' Covid response\nAmazon defeats historic Alabama union effort ALU organisers formed the group after a Staten Island worker was fired after organising a walkout last year. Chris Smalls had been protesting against allegedly unsafe working conditions during the pandemic, but Amazon claimed he had repeatedly violated social distancing guidelines. Later, Mr Smalls, who is black, was described as \"not smart, or articulate\" in a leaked internal memo discussing Amazon's approach to worker activism during Covid. It sparked accusations of racism, and one of Amazon's lawyers apologised. New York's attorney general Letitia James is now suing Amazon for allegedly retaliating against Mr Smalls. The Staten Island efforts come after an unsuccessful attempt by warehouse workers to unionise in Bessemer, Alabama earlier this year. Currently no Amazon warehouses in the US are unionised. The NLRB says it may allow a rerun of that vote, following accusations Amazon interfered in the process. The company strongly denies those claims. Amazon spokeswoman Kelly Nantel said: \"Our employees have the choice of whether or not to join a union. They always have. As a company, we don't think unions are the best answer for our employees. \"Every day we empower people to find ways to improve their jobs, and when they do that we want to make those changes - quickly. That type of continuous improvement is harder to do quickly and nimbly with unions in the middle.\" The US is currently experience a swell of industrial action, sparked by frustration over working conditions during the pandemic. This month nurses, factory employees and TV and film crew held or threatened to hold walkouts. There have also been successful unionisation drives in 2021 at Google, the American Civil Liberties Union, and the Mission Hospital in North Carolina, one of the US states that is least sympathetic to unions.

            "content": "The company behind brands such as PG Tips, Cornetto and Dove has said it will raise prices to cope with \"elevated levels\" of cost inflation which it expects to continue next year. Consumer goods giant Unilever said that it had already lifted its pricing. Unilever said this would continue across its global operations and within each of its product divisions. The company reported a 2.5% rise in sales for the third quarter to 30 September. Growth was supported by a 4.1% increase in prices while the volume of goods sold fell by 1.5%. On Wednesday, the Office for National Statistics said that the UK consumer prices index (CPI) measure of inflation slowed to 3.1% in the year to September. However, inflation is expected to accelerate in the coming months due to a rise in energy costs as well as continuing disruption to UK and global supply chains. Unilever's chief financial officer, Graeme Pitkethly, said: \"We expect inflation to be higher next year than this year.\" It is not yet clear how Unilever's price rises will affect consumers. The company sells to businesses such as retailers, supermarkets and wholesalers who may or may not pass on higher costs to shoppers. But Danni Hewson, financial analyst at AJ Bell, said Unilever was facing a \"balancing act of not increasing prices so much that its products are no longer competitive\". \"It is a real test of the strength of the company's brands,\" she said. \"After all, will we really stick with branded soap at a materially higher price when there's an unbranded alternative sitting next to it on the shelf which is an order of magnitude cheaper? \"If enough consumers decide they can put up with a cheaper alternative then it would become a big problem for Unilever.\" Unilever's brands include Simple skin care, Sure deodorant and Vaseline. It also produces Marmite, Ben & Jerry's ice cream, Hellmann's mayonnaise and Knorr stocks among many others. Unilever said it expected its full-year sales to grow between 3% and 5%, but that its profit margin would be unchanged. Earlier this week, the boss of the Food & Drink Federation warned that the hospitality industry, which includes restaurants and pubs, was seeing \"terrifying\" price inflation of between 14% and 18%. Mark Derry, executive chairman of Brasserie Bar Co, which owns the Brasserie Blanc chain of restaurants and whose chef patron is Raymond Blanc, told the BBC that while trading was holding up well, costs were rising which means it would have to raise prices for diners. \"There is an inevitable effect of all of this inflation and that is that we will have to try and put prices up,\" he said \"At the moment, we've tried very hard to hold them because obviously we've come out of a very, very serious problem over the last year and a half and doing our best to control it, but I cannot see how it is possible not to put prices up, frankly.\" Kraft Heinz, known for its tomato ketchup and baked beans, recently warned that people will have to get used to higher food prices. On Wednesday, food giant Nestle revealed that it had also increased prices, which rose by 2.1% in the third quarter. The maker of Kit-Kats, Nescafé and Purina pet products, said prices had risen on the back of higher energy and raw materials costs as well as transport. The Financial Times reported that Nestle's chief executive, Mark Schneider, said \"inflation costs are rising faster than we can roll forward through pricing. The situation has not improved. If anything we are seeing further downsides compared to what we told you in the summer\". ",

            "header": "Abolish energy price cap, says Scottish Power boss",
            "content": "The boss of one of the UK's biggest energy companies has called for the energy price cap to be abolished. Keith Anderson, chief executive of Scottish Power, said the recent energy crisis had exposed deep flaws in the way the energy market was structured. He added there had been serious failures on the part of Ofgem. The regulator said the price cap had helped to keep down costs for millions of households. Mr Anderson said that the price cap was a popular idea politically but it has caused dozens of companies to go bust. As wholesale prices soared six-fold this year, companies had to buy gas at a price miles more than the rate they were allowed to sell it. \"There was a fixation about trying to create more and more competition and get more and more companies into the energy sector,\" he said. \"But it went too far. We ended up with a raft of small, not particularly well-run organisations coming into the retail sector. This crisis has shown this is quite a risky business.\" Energy price cap not working, says power boss\nWhy are gas prices so high and what is happening to fuel bills? He said that the regulator asking well-run companies to take on millions of customers from poorly-run and resourced companies is placing a massive burden on the sector which will mean prices will have to rise for the next 12 to 18 months. \"Every customer taken on at the price cap means £1,000 of cost,\" he said. \"We estimate the total cost to the industry of between £4bn and £5bn. \"The risk is that you will end up going back to the big five or the big six.\" He added that a one-size-fits-all cap was regressive, as it did not even succeed in protecting more vulnerable customers, who spend a disproportionate amount of household income on energy. His solution would be the abolition of the cap while having a special tariff for people in fuel poverty. More affluent customers would pay more but that would be a more progressive way to regulate the industry. Mr Anderson was scathing about the competence of Ofgem saying the regulations were not fit for purpose. \"The regulator has not kept pace with what has been going on in the marketplace,\" he added. Ofgem responded by saying that the price cap had played its part in cushioning millions of households from soaring gas prices. But it acknowledged that regulations would need to change. \"Ofgem, with industry and the government, will need to build an energy market that is more resilient to shocks like this in the future. \"This is likely to mean an approach to regulation which is more focussed on the business models that enter and operate in our energy market, and on the risk they carry,\" it said. Mr Anderson rejected the notion that he is advocating an oligopoly with no price controls in which profit margins were allowed to be higher and people were disinclined to switch because they have seen smaller suppliers go bust. He said that a removal of the cap would not see profiteering as a market of 10 or 15 well-run companies in competition would provide good value for money. Mr Anderson noted that would still be more market competitors than you see in banking or supermarkets. He acknowledged the cost of transitioning to a net zero economy would be hundreds of billions which would end up on our bills or in taxes but said that it would ideally be spread over decades. The economic activity it generated would ripple right across the UK economy creating thousands of jobs, he said. His comments come the day after Scottish Power confirmed it was investing £6bn in three offshore wind projects. It was the centrepiece of a raft of investments the government announced at a global investment summit in London followed by a reception for business leaders at Windsor Castle attended by the prime minister and the Queen.

            "content": "The UK has agreed a free trade deal with New Zealand which it says will benefit consumers and businesses. Prime Minister Boris Johnson said the deal will cut costs for exporters and open up New Zealand's job market to UK professionals. The government hopes it is a step towards joining a trade club with the likes of Canada and Japan. The New Zealand deal itself is unlikely to boost UK growth, according to the government's own estimates. Overall, only a tiny proportion of UK trade is done with New Zealand, less than 0.2%. Labour and the National Farmers Union (NFU) said the deal could hurt UK farmers and lower food standards. But International Trade Secretary Anne-Marie Trevelyan said it \"affords opportunities in both directions for great sharing of produce\" and British farmers should not be worried. How many trade deals has the UK done?\nUK 'cut climate pledges' to clinch Australia trade deal\nUK wants to join the club - but what is the CPTPP?\nChina applies to join key Asia-Pacific trade pact Mr Johnson and New Zealand's Prime Minister, Jacinda Ardern, agreed the pact in a video call on Wednesday after 16 months of negotiations. Tariffs will be removed on UK goods including clothing, ships and bulldozers, and on New Zealand goods including wine, honey and kiwi fruits. Professionals such as lawyers and architects will be able to work in New Zealand more easily, the government said. However, the deal is not likely to increase UK economic growth - or GDP - according to the UK government's own assessments. New Zealand will fare slightly better as it may be able to sell more lamb to the UK. But, like the trade deal recently struck with Australia, the UK hopes this is a step towards joining the Comprehensive and Progressive Agreement for Trans-Pacific Partnership (CPTPP) - a trade bloc that includes Australasia, Canada, Mexico and Japan among others. The UK already has deals with many of the members, rolled over from when it was in the EU. But CPTPP membership would give it more access in terms of services and digital trade. In a video of the deal being struck, Mr Johnson said: \"We've scrummed down, we've packed tight, and together we've got the ball over the line and we have a deal. And I think it's a great deal.\" Ms Ardern said: \"I loved your use of rugby metaphors, but if we were going to continue that on, then naturally it would conclude with the All Blacks winning. \"And I know that New Zealand feels that way with this free trade agreement, but actually, it's good for both of us, as it happens.\" The NFU said the deal, like the one with Australia, could have a \"huge downside\", especially for UK dairy and meat farmers. Its president, Minette Batters, said the Australia and New Zealand deals mean \"we will be opening our doors to significant extra volumes of imported food - whether or not produced to our own high standards - while securing almost nothing in return for UK farmers\". \"The fact is that UK farm businesses face significantly higher costs of production than farmers in New Zealand and Australia, and it's worth remembering that margins are already tight here due to ongoing labour shortages and rising costs on farm,\" she said. \"The government is now asking British farmers to go toe-to-toe with some of the most export-orientated farmers in the world, without the serious, long-term and properly funded investment in UK agriculture that can enable us to do so. Emily Thornberry, shadow trade secretary, said the government's own figures showed the deal would \"cut employment in our farming communities, produce zero additional growth, and generate just £112m in additional exports for UK firms compared to pre-pandemic levels\". She added that the only winners were \"the mega-corporations who run New Zealand's meat and dairy farms\". \"As our economy recovers from the pandemic, we need trade deals that will boost jobs and growth, open up big new markets for UK exporters, and support our objectives to buy, make and sell more in Britain. This trade deal with New Zealand fails on every count,\" she said. The international trade secretary said British farmers should not be concerned about increased lamb imports because the lambing seasons were different in the UK and New Zealand. Anne-Marie Trevelyan said: \"I'm very comfortable it's a complimentary - because of the seasons… consumers will have more choice.\" She said trade with New Zealand was currently worth £2.3bn a year but had the potential to increase by up to 30% by 2030. Analysis: Ramzan Karmali, BBC Business reporter A bottle of New Zealand Sauvignon Blanc could cost 20p less as a result of this trade deal and other products like Manuka honey and kiwi fruits could also cost less. In terms of overall trade, even by the UK government's own analysis a tariff free trade deal will make no difference at all to the country's GDP - the total value of the goods and services the UK produces. Overall the trade between the two countries is less than 0.2% of the UK total and in fact in 2018 New Zealand ranked as only our 53rd biggest trading partner. So why does this deal matter? The UK signed its first big post-Brexit deal with Japan last year and in June it also signed a draft agreement for a trade deal with Australia. Both countries, as well as New Zealand, are members of the Comprehensive and Progressive Agreement for Trans-Pacific Partnership or CPTPP. The combined GDP for the 11 nations that form the CPTPP in 2020 was £8.4trn - one of the key reasons given by the UK government when it formally applied earlier this year. This deal is the first agreed during the tenure of Britain's new Secretary of State for International Trade, Anne-Marie Trevelyan, who took over from Liz Truss last month. She believes that by getting this deal done the UK's application to the CPTPP will be looked upon more favourably. That being said, the trade deal the UK really wants is with the US. But with the recent change in administration in the White House that seems further away. ",

            "header": "TotalEnergies accused of downplaying climate risks",
            "content": "French oil company TotalEnergies knew at least 50 years ago about a link between burning fossil fuels and global warming, researchers have said. An article from 1971 in the company's magazine, Total Information, mentioned partial melting of ice caps, researchers found. It also predicted the rise of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere. The company denied it had concealed climate risk and added that since 2015 it had focussed on renewable energy Check out more of the BBC's business stories from the COP26 summit The research, which follows similar studies about US oil giant ExxonMobil and Royal Dutch, was carried out by three historians and published on Wednesday in the peer-reviewed journal Global Environment Change. The researchers said the 1971 Total article warned that burning fossil fuels since the 19th Century had increased the concentration of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere, and this would continue if fuels were burned at the same pace. \"It is not impossible, according to some, to foresee at least a partial melting of the polar ice caps, which would certainly result in significant sea level rise. The catastrophic consequences are easy to imagine,\" the Total Information article said. Despite this, by the late 1980s Total \"began promoting doubt regarding the scientific basis for global warming\", moving from \"denial to delay,\" the researchers said. The company \"ultimately settled on a position in the late 1990s of publicly accepting climate science while promoting policy delay or policies peripheral to fossil fuel control.\" In 2021 Total rebranded as TotalEnergies. The oil giant said its knowledge of climate risk was \"no different to that published in the scientific journals of the time, which the scientific study published today fully confirms\". \"It is therefore wrong to claim that the climate risk was concealed by Total,\" the statement said. \"TotalEnergies deplores the process of pointing the finger at a situation from 50 years ago, without highlighting the efforts, changes, progress and investments made since then,\" the firm added.   It also said that since 2015, it is transforming its operations profoundly towards renewable energy. However, environmental campaigners from climate change campaign group, 350.org disputed this and accused the company of greenwashing. Fossil fuel production set to soar in next decade\nHow smart appliances can help fix the energy gap\nUK firms will have to disclose climate impact They have called for banks to cut ties the company and have argued it should be held accountable for what they said was stolen time. Clémence Dubois from 350.org told the BBC's World Service that Total \"didn't just know about climate change, they implemented a strategy of fabricating doubt around the climate emergency through lobbying\". \"They prevented any form of regulation of their activities and the biggest problem is that they have been continuing to develop fossil fuels on a massive scale\", she continued. \"It's a rogue industry and this is why we are organising to hold them accountable,\" she added. Dan Lunt, professor of climate science at the University of Bristol, told the BBC that the research \"doesn't surprise\" him. \"There are several oil companies that have been using results from climate models to actually aid their oil exploration at the same time as ignoring the future predictions from the same models - and that's been happening for decades,\" he said. \"The only way we can achieve the targets that are going to save the most vulnerable people is to stop the burning of fossil fuels and that has to start happening immediately,\" Professor Lunt said. \"The changes TotalEnergies say they are making are not nearly enough compared to what is needed to achieve our target of 1.5 degrees, enshrined in the Paris agreement,\" he added. Professor Andy Shepherd, director of the Centre for Polar Observation & Modelling, said the evidence is \"pretty clear cut\". \"Total can claim they weren't aware of the dangers, but few people will believe that.\" \"In fact the article was remarkably prescient, predicting CO2 concentration in the atmosphere would surpass 400 parts per million by 2010 - which was spot on,\" he added. \"Indeed they were among the first to raise awareness of the impacts on ice melting, and in a different world they might take credit for this,\" he added. The UK has committed to reduce its greenhouse-gas emissions to net zero by 2050. As part of this promise, the government has a target to cut emissions by 78% by 2035, compared with 1990 levels. In June, a group of experts that advises the government said Boris Johnson had credible policies in place to deliver only about a fifth of this cut. ",

            "content": "Morocco has banned flights to and from the UK due to the coronavirus pandemic. Several UK airlines and holiday companies have been told by the Moroccan government that flights will be suspended from 23:59 BST on Wednesday until further notice. Flights between Morocco and Germany and the Netherlands have also been suspended. The BBC has contacted the Moroccan embassy and tourism office, as well as the UK Foreign Office for comment. Latest figures from the European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control said that Morocco's weekly rate of reported coronavirus cases on 14 October stood at 10.4 per 100,000 people, compared with 445.5 per 100,000 people in the UK. On Tuesday, the UK reported 43,738 new Covid-19 infections, with new cases above 40,000 for seven days in a row. The number of patients in hospital rose by 10% in a week to 7,749 on Monday. Another 223 deaths were recorded, the largest number since March, although daily figures are often higher on Tuesdays. What tests do I need to go on holiday abroad?\nAmber list scrapped as travel rules simplified\nUK holidays: What are the rules? The UK government updated its advice on travel to Morocco to state that the Moroccan government has suspended direct flights between the UK and Morocco for an unspecified period of time. UK passengers are not banned from travelling from the country, but must travel via a third country to do so. The advice states that UK travellers will need to provide proof that they have been fully vaccinated for at least two weeks or a negative PCR test taken no more than 48 hours before boarding. They will also be asked to present a Public Health Passenger form to the Moroccan authorities on arrival. EasyJet has said that it was told this morning. It has cancelled its outbound flights from the UK, Germany and Netherlands to Morocco until 30 November. The airline had two flights operating from Manchester and Gatwick to Marrakech, which it will operate as \"ferry flights\" for return customers due to travel back to the UK today. It said that, ahead of receiving further guidance from the Moroccan government, it intends to fly inbound flights in the coming days as repatriation flight options. \"We are contacting all customers whose flights are cancelled with their options, which include a free of charge transfer, receiving a voucher or a refund,\" an EasyJet statement said. British Airways has cancelled a flight from Heathrow to the same destination, meanwhile holiday operator Tui confirmed it had also been contacted by the Moroccan government. Tui said: \"We are contacting customers in departure date order to discuss their options, which include amending to another destination or a full refund. We would like to thank our customers for their patience and understanding during this time.\" The tour operator said it currently has about 2,000 UK travellers in Morocco, but hasnot yet confirmed whether it will need to bring these passengers back early. The flight ban will affect families in England and Wales who booked half-term holidays in Morocco for next week. Morocco's National Office of Airports said the policy will remain in place \"until further notice\". The UK's Foreign Office has updated its advice on travel to Morocco to include the latest development. It says that passengers returning to the UK from Morocco should contact their airline or tour operator to arrange an alternative route via a third country, such as Spain or France, where flights are operating as normal. Alison Sedgewick is currently on holiday in Agadir, off the south-western coast of Morocco, with her husband and son. On Thursday, they were due to return from their first holiday in the two and a half years since her son was born. \"You couldn't write it… the one week we've chosen to go away and they've closed the borders while we're here,\" she said. However, Ms Sedgewick added she felt hopeful that because she booked a package holiday with Tui, things would get sorted out swiftly. She said she received a \"holding message\" from the tour operator, telling her she will hear more information within 24 hours. \"I'm hoping it'll be a bit sooner than that because the bus to the airport is supposed to be picking us at half six tomorrow evening,\" she added. While she joked that her main concern is ensuring she doesn't run out of nappies for her son, Ms Sedgewick said she did feel put off the idea of travelling during the upcoming winter months. \"We debated doing a city break in November or December but I don't feel confident travelling abroad over winter because things like this might become more common,\" she said. Meanwhile, Peter Mercer, the owner of the Dar Zaman boutique hotel in Marrakech, said that several guests were \"rushing around\" and attempting to return to the UK on Wednesday before the ban came into place. \"It's going to have a major impact, not just from the UK but also the flights from Germany and the Netherlands,\" he said. \"It's not very encouraging because we're suddenly back to where we were in March 2020. In terms of our business model, it is worrying. People perhaps will lose faith in travel because restrictions can be imposed with little notice.\" While Mr Mercer said that he agrees with the Moroccan government's actions to reduce the spread of coronavirus, he hopes any restrictions on travel will be short-term.

            "content": "A deal to sell a $2.6bn stake in the world's most indebted property firm to a rival company has fallen through. Chinese property giant Evergrande Group suspended its shares on 4 October ahead of \"an announcement containing inside information about a major transaction\". It was reported that real estate firm Hopson Development was set to buy a 51% stake in its property services unit. Both companies halted trading for more than two weeks, but will now resume on Thursday after the agreement collapsed. The crisis at Evergrande has triggered fears that its potential collapse could send shockwaves through global markets. Investors have concerns about its more than $300bn (£222bn) of debt. The firm's shares have fallen by almost 80% since the start of this year. The company's total liabilities are equal to around 2% of China's gross domestic product. What is Evergrande and is it too big to fail?\nEvergrande shares halted as 'major' update awaited The parties said in separate filings to the Hong Kong Stock Exchange that they were unable to agree on the terms of the deal. Hopson Development said that Evergrande told it the deal had been terminated on 13 October. Hopson added: \"The company is exploring the options available to it for the protection of its legitimate interests in relation to the agreement.\" In a stock market statement, Evergrande Group chairman and founder Hui Ka Yan said the company would \"use its best effort to negotiate for the renewal or extension of its borrowings or other alternative arrangements with its creditors\", following the deal's collapse. \"There is no guarantee that the group will be able to meet its financial obligations under the relevant financing documents and other contracts,\" he added. \"If the group is unable to meet its guarantee obligation or to repay any debt when due or agree with its creditors on renewal or extension of its borrowings or alternative arrangements, it would have a material adverse effect on the group's business, prospects, financial condition and results of operations.\" In recent weeks Evergrande has struggled to make payments to investors in its bonds and wealth management products. The indebted property giant reportedly missed interest payments to overseas investors twice in September. The company has been taking steps to raise money owed to customers, investors and suppliers. It has previously said it was selling a $1.5bn stake it owned in a commercial bank. ",

The plan said the region needs to remove railway bottlenecks, phase out dial-up internet and boost rural businesses if it is to maximise growth. MPs, business leaders and councillors attended a Parliamentary reception on Tuesday to discuss the plan. Mid Norfolk MP George Freeman said implementing the plan would be a fitting tribute to Sir David Amess. According to the Local Democracy Reporting Service, the report said bottlenecks in the region's railway lines had created \"challenges\" to the local economy. It said cash boosts were needed at two crucial railway junctions, namely Haughley, near Stowmarket in Suffolk, and at Ely in Cambridgeshire. It also argued that councils must be given more freedom and flexibility with how they fund themselves. Many councils rely heavily on income generation through tourism, car parking charges and planning processes, it said. These revenue streams had been severely hit by Covid-19, the report said. Some parts of the region were still reliant on dial-up internet, which the report said contributed to \"digital exclusion experienced by our most hard-to-reach households during the pandemic\". It said the government should commit to high-speed broadband across the region. The report also looked at climate change and investment in \"left-behind\" communities. Mr Freeman, the Conservative MP who is also the government's science minister, said: \"It would be a fitting tribute to Sir David Amess MP to build an inclusive eastern England so everyone - from windiest Norfolk to muddiest Essex and the north of Cambridgeshire and Peterborough - feels part of the innovation economy that is so crucial to our future.\" Sir David, the MP for Southend West, was killed at a constituency event on Friday.

            "content": "Gaming giant Activision Blizzard says more than 20 employees have \"exited\" the company following numerous sexual harassment and discrimination claims. The firm has spent the last several months dealing with a handful of lawsuits and claims about its allegedly toxic workplace environment. More than 20 other employees have faced disciplinary action, it said in a letter to staff on Tuesday. Some of those known to have left include high-profile game developers. Activision did not say it fired any specific individual or that any of those departures were connected to any allegations. In Tuesday's letter, however, it directly said at least 40 staff had suffered consequences following reports of misconduct - and that covers only those reports \"resolved\" so far. Activision Blizzard said that it hoped to \"earn our team's confidence that, when they speak up, they will be heard\". It also revealed it would be hiring 19 full-time roles that will be focused on helping to create a \"more accountable workplace\" for its employees. Activision staff hit back over harassment claims\n'Men guess what I'm wearing while gaming online' The company's chief compliance officer, Frances Townsend, said that staff who violate its policies would be \"terminated or disciplined\" regardless of their seniority. \"We call it as we see it,\" she told the Financial Times. \"It doesn't matter what your rank is, what your job is. If you've committed some sort of misconduct or you're a leader who has tolerated a culture that is not consistent with our values, we're going to take action. The impact on the business is not a consideration.\" The BBC has asked Activision Blizzard for comment. In September, Activision Blizzard announced that it had reached an $18m (£13m) settlement agreement with the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission (EEOC). The watchdog sued the video games giant following a three-year-long investigation into its workplace culture. However, the EEOC case was just one of several. California's Department of Fair Employment and Housing took legal action against the company in July, following a two-year investigation. It accused the gaming giant of having a \"frat boy\" culture, in which female employees are subjected to unequal pay, retaliation, and harassment, which it said the company was failing to prevent. Activision Blizzard denied any wrongdoing, and continues to fight that case. However, it sparked hundreds of employees to stage a walkout in August, and more than 2,000 staff also signed a petition in response. ",

But food delivery firm Deliveroo said the average order size is falling, down from £24.20 a year ago to £23.80. It reported a 59% increase in UK orders between July and September, partly owing to new partnerships with Amazon and Morrisons. It had 35.8 million orders in the the UK and Ireland, compared with 22.6 million in the same period in 2020. \"We expect further strong performance in the remainder of the year,\" said Will Shu, founder and chief executive. Taking account of international orders, the figure climbed to 74.6 million, up from 45.4 million, a 64% rise. It said that the average customer ordered 3.3 times a month between July and September \"despite the widespread removal of lockdown restrictions\". Deliveroo orders double as lockdown habits endure\nDeliveroo shares soar after rival buys stake The company was boosted by a deal with Amazon to offer to Amazon Prime customers free access for a year to its premium subscription service, Deliveroo Plus. That resulted in a doubling of members of the delivery firm's service, which offers free unlimited delivery on orders above £25. It also said it benefited from a new rapid grocery service, known as Deliveroo Hop, launched in partnership with Morrisons in September. However, the average number of monthly active consumers fell from from 7.8 million in the second quarter to 7.5 million in the third quarter. In the UK and Ireland, the company's gross transaction value fell over the three months, from £921m to £852m. In its international markets, gross transactional value fell from £818m to £742m. Deliveroo said that reflected \"typical seasonality, especially in European markets\". Mr Shu remained upbeat. \"We remain excited about the opportunity ahead and our plans to deliver better value to our consumers, help our restaurant and grocery partners to grow, and provide further opportunities for riders,\" he said. In August, the firm published its first set of results since floating on the stock market in March this year.

            "content": "\"I love designing products, I studied it at university and I love doing it as a living,\" says Jo Barnard, CEO of industrial design consultancy Morrama. But she says she got so wrapped up in seeing through the first product design job her firm was given that she forgot to secure any contracts to follow it, which brought her company close to shutting down. Jo started Morrama six years ago. Based in Hackney in east London, it helps companies to design new products, from the concept stage through to commercial production. It has 10 members of staff and it works almost exclusively with start-ups. \"After about six months of picking up odd jobs here and there, we managed to land a project with an American client to design a suitcase,\" she recalls. \"The contract was more than enough to support the business for a year. I brought on two designers and an engineer to work with me to design the product.\" The project was so important that Jo decided she would head up the design team and work on it full time. However, her co-founder decided to leave Morrama shortly afterwards, so she also had to take on the extra responsibilities of managing its back-office operations and planning its future growth. \"I was left being the managing director, creative director and the project director while still trying to on-board three members of staff who had just started working for me,\" says Jo. \"I threw myself into everything, but my main focus was to make the project work properly and deliver what we had set out to deliver.\" But she had spent so much time on the project in hand that she had neglected another vital function of the CEO role - winning new orders for the firm. \"The company had been going for about sixteen months and people were saying 'Wow! the business seems to be thriving'. But the whole success of the business had been based on that one project, and then the project came to an end. \"You don't get paid after that, and there was nothing for the designers to do. I had completely forgotten what came next. We had two and a half months' of money left before we ran out, and that would be the end of Morrama.\" Jo used a large part of the company's remaining cash to hire a new studio manager to help her drum up new business, and the company landed two more projects. She says the episode has taught her an important lesson about the role of a CEO. \"What needed to happen was to make sure that every potential lead that came in was carefully nurtured, and to put ourselves out there to make new leads. Those sorts of things, I've not been particularly good at - ever. But it doesn't matter if you're not good at it. You have to get on and do it. \"The main learning was that planning can never be left until the last minute. It's so, so important to know what comes next. You have to be thinking about that from the very beginning and not putting off those emails, not putting off following up on new business. \"You have to put yourself out there, go to events and think about generating those new leads. \"As soon as one job is over the next one has to be lined up, or else the pipeline stops, and the business is finished.\" ",

            "content": "A Brewdog promotion which said customers could win \"solid gold\" beer cans was misleading, the advertising watchdog has found. The Scottish brewer offered shoppers the chance to find a gold can hidden in cases sold from its online store. But some winners complained to the Advertising Standards Authority after they discovered the cans were not solid gold, but were gold-plated instead. The ASA upheld the complaints and said three adverts were misleading. In response to the ASA's ruling, James Watt, co-founder and chief executive at Brewdog, said: \"We hold our hands up, we got the first gold can campaign wrong.\" Brewdog in row over £15,000 gold can price\nEx-Brewdog staff allege culture of fear at brewer\nCraft beer accused of being 'sexist boys' club' The ruling comes amid heavy criticism of Brewdog in recent months, with a letter from ex-workers stating former staff had \"suffered mental illness\" as a result of working for the craft beer brewer. It made a number of allegations, including that Brewdog fostered a culture where staff were afraid to speak out about concerns. The ASA said it received 25 complaints in relation to three social media adverts stating its can prize was made from \"solid gold\". In its ruling, the watchdog said it \"understood the prize consisted of 24 carat gold-plated replica cans\", but added \"because the ads stated that the prize included a solid gold can when that was not the case, we concluded the ads were misleading\". The ASA said it had told Brewdog not to state or imply that consumers would receive a solid gold can when it was not the case. One of the competition winners, Mark Craig, still contests the value of the gold-plated can that he won and believes it is \"not worth anything\". Mr Craig, from Lisburn, Northern Ireland, told the BBC: \"They are meant to be there for the little guy and this is two fingers to their customers who are the ones who were taken by this.\" He criticised the company's apology, which he said appeared to be encouraging people to buy more beer in a \"new competition run correctly this time\". Brewdog said its social media posts which contained the words \"solid gold\" did so in error and repeated that mistakes were a result of miscommunication between its marketing and social media teams. As well as complaints over the prize's authenticity, some winners questioned how much the can was worth. Brewdog claimed it was valued at £15,000. Mr Watt said the company stood by its valuation which it previously said was based on several factors, including the manufacturing price, metal and quality of the product. The ASA said Brewdog told investigators that a single 330ml can, made with the equivalent 330ml of pure gold, would have a gold value of about $500,000 (£363,000). The ASA said it considered a general audience \"was unlikely to be aware of the price of gold, how that would translate into the price of a gold can, and whether that was inconsistent with the valuation as stated in the ad\". The brewer has been heavily criticised in recent months with allegations being made about its culture, which has led to an independent review of the organisation. So far, more than 100 interviews with former staff have \"either taken place or are scheduled for the coming weeks\" as part of the review, according the firm's website. Mr Watt has previously apologised to former staff and said their complaints would help make him a better chief executive. However, in a recent interview with the Daily Telegraph, he said the brewer \"should have been clearer about the high-performance culture\" and suggested there was a \"mismatch of expectations\" among certain employees. The BBC previously reported that a note from Mr Watt to staff said it was \"fair to say that this type of fast-paced and intense environment is definitely not for everyone, but many of our fantastic long-term team members have thrived in our culture\". As well as the ruling on Brewdog, the ASA also upheld a complaint against an advert by plant-drink maker Alpro on the side of a bus. The complainant believed commercial almond farming caused environmental damage and challenged whether the product was \"good for the planet\" as stated. The ASA said there was \"no qualification\" to the claim and \"little context provided\" in the ad to interpret it. It added that Alpro revealed the almonds used in its almond drink were cultivated in a sustainable way and not sourced from regions with environmentally damaging processes. ",

            "content": "People are taking out more money when they visit ATMs, with the average amount climbing more than £10 to just under £80 in the last two years. But they're using cash machines 40% less than before and withdrawing £44 a month less. Withdrawals are now nearly £100m less a day than in 2019, said cash machine network Link. \"Covid has turbocharged the switch to digital,\" said Nick Quin, head of financial inclusion at the network. Before the pandemic, each adult in the UK visited a cash machine on average three times a month, taking out on average £66.99. That amount has climbed to £78.54. However, 18 months after the coronavirus crisis started, visits are now less than twice a month. That means the total average amount each month withdrawn per person has fallen £44, from £200.97 to £157.08. Rural vacuum for getting hold of cash\nCash access as vital as running water, says Age UK The total value of Link ATM withdrawals is currently running at around £1.6bn a week, compared with around £2.2bn in 2019. Meanwhile the amount people can spend on a contactless card rocketed to £100 earlier this month, after climbing to £45 in April 2020. \"Crucially, even though we're withdrawing almost £100m less per day, millions still rely on cash, especially in the most deprived areas of the country,\" said Mr Quin. \"It is important we continue to protect access to cash across the country.\" The latest Financial Lives survey from the Financial Conduct Authority showed that more than five million people rely on cash every day. Link's new figures suggest that some wealthier parts of Edinburgh and London have shown a fall in cash machine use by as much as 60%. But there remains a greater reliance on cash in areas such as Liverpool, Bradford and Birmingham where the fall in ATM usage is considerably smaller. Link said it heard from more 400 communities this year wanting better cash access. It has installed more than 70 machines across the country in response to those requests and a further 30 in areas identified as lacking cash access. It said it is encouraging people to speak up if they find it difficult to access cash free of charge. \"It is important we continue to protect access to cash across the country,\" said Mr Quin. Link said the number of ATMs has not dropped as quickly as cash usage. Since the beginning of the pandemic, the number of free-to-use ATMs has dropped 9% from 45,000 to 41,000. In July the Financial Conduct Authority warned that people living in rural areas are having to travel further to find somewhere to withdraw and deposit cash free of charge. The City watchdog said almost every urban resident has access to a bank, building society, post office or ATM within two kilometres of their home, but only three-quarters of the UK rural population has similar access. It is considering stronger requirements of the sector to ensure the millions of people who rely on notes and coins have access to it. Meanwhile the charity Age UK said that people required the same guarantee of access to cash as they did for running water, electricity and the post. About 2.4 million people aged 65-and-over rely on cash in their daily lives, it said. The charity warned that many would face being excluded from society if they could not get hold of notes and coins. Constituency areas with the smallest percentage declines in the volume of cash withdrawals: Liverpool Walton, 20% Bradford South, 20% Birmingham, Hodge Hill, 20% Leicester East, 21% Bradford East, 22% Boston and Skegness, 23% Birmingham, Perry Barr, 23% Warley, 24% Cynon Valley, 25% Rochdale, 25% * based on figures from Link comparing August 2019 with August 2021 Constituency areas with the biggest percentage declines in the volume of cash withdrawals: Edinburgh East, 63% Cities of London and Westminster, 60% Edinburgh North and Leith, 60% Holborn and St Pancras, 58% Edinburgh South, 56% Glasgow Central, 56% Edinburgh West, 56% Crawley, 55% Belfast South, 54% Bristol West, 53% * based on figures from Link comparing August 2019 with August 2021 ",

The bank will also write off $200m of debt \"tainted by corruption\" that was owed by the African country, the Financial Conduct Authority said. The fine is part of a $475m settlement with UK, Swiss and US regulators. Credit Suisse staff allegedly took and paid bribes as they arranged $1.3bn of industry loans. The UK's Financial Conduct Authority (FCA) said the bank had \"failed to properly manage the risk of financial crime\". Executive director of enforcement Mark Steward said: \"The FCA's fine reflects the impact of these tainted transactions which included a debt crisis and economic harm for the people of Mozambique. \"The fine would have been higher if not for Credit Suisse agreeing to provide the debt write-off of $200m.\" Mozambique's tuna corruption scandal puts justice on trial According to the FCA, a Mozambique government contractor secretly paid \"significant kickbacks, estimated at over $50m, to members of Credit Suisse's deal team\" between 2012 and 2016 in order to secure loans at more favourable rates. Two managing directors at the investment bank were among those to allegedly receive the bribes. Meanwhile, Mozambican officials received at least $137m in bribes during the same period, the FCA said. The US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) said Credit Suisse had \"deficient internal accounting controls, which failed to properly address significant and known risks concerning bribery\". The bank has agreed to pay the SEC nearly $100m, the regulator said. Former Credit Suisse investment bankers and their intermediaries have been indicted, the SEC said. The fine comes as 19 individuals - including the son of former President Armando Guebuza - have gone on trial in Mozambique charged with bribery, embezzlement and money laundering. They deny the claims. ",

            "content": "Food and drink firms are seeing \"terrifying\" price rises, a sector trade body has said, warning of a knock-on effect for consumers. Food and Drink Federation boss Ian Wright told MPs inflation is between 14% and 18% for hospitality firms. The price rises for food firms' ingredients will lead to consumer price rises, he said, and described the situation as concerning. The UK's rate of inflation was 3.2% in August and is expected to rise further. Bank of England governor Andrew Bailey recently warned it \"will have to act\", suggesting that UK interest rates may soon rise from the historic low of 0.1%. Mr Wright told MPs on the Business, Energy and Industrial Strategy select committee: \"Inflation is a bigger scourge than anything else because it discriminates against the poor.\" What is the UK's inflation rate and why is it going up?\nWhy is there an HGV driver shortage? The Office for National Statistics will publish the latest inflation figures for September on Wednesday. It is expected to rise further above the Bank of England's target of 2% for longer than previously thought. Make UK, the manufacturers' organisation, said that inflation was becoming \"baked in\" among its members. Stephen Phipson, chief executive at Make UK, told MPs that while there was a welcome rise in demand, many manufacturers are looking at 30% to 40% average increases in material costs. \"When people are able to get hold of materials they are passing those costs on which does imply to us that inflation is more or less baked in at this stage now,\" he said. \"This is not a transitory inflationary demand we are seeing really serious issues now in terms of price increases.\" Des Gunewardena, chief executive of high-end restaurant group D&D London, says his business has seen half of its costs rise, including surging energy prices. He says staff shortages are his \"number one issue\" and has increased salaries by 10%. The business has 1,700 employees across the UK and is currently 150 staff short, which he said could lead to a \"nightmare situation\" in the busier December period. Table covers have been reduced from 400 on a Friday night at his Quaglino's restaurant to between 300 and 350 due to staff shortages. However, he said the restaurants have seen increased customer spending, so he is stocking up on specific champagne brands ahead of time, to pre-empt possible supply problems. \"I think we'll have a very strong Christmas so there's no need to panic yet, but I expect further inflation in January when there won't be the same spending to offset the extra costs\". Amid concerns about deliveries of food, fuel and other items in the run-up to Christmas, the government is taking steps to address the shortage of HGV drivers. The shortage has been blamed on several factors, including Covid, Brexit and tax changes. The government introduced temporary visas for 5,000 lorry drivers to work in the UK, although only just over 20 of the 300 applications have been approved so far, according to Conservative Party chairman Oliver Dowden. Duncan Buchanan, policy director at the Road Haulage Association (RHA), told the select committee that the government's visa scheme to ease driver shortages had been \"designed to fail\". \"Reports haven't really eased at all things are not visibly getting better at this stage,\" he said. Regarding the government's measures to try to ease the crisis, Mr Buchanan said \"visually on the ground that is not having an effect\". A survey by the RHA of its members estimated there was now a shortage of more than 100,000 qualified drivers in the UK. \"The consumer is really going to visualise this in terms of reduced choice. We have supply chain disruption but that doesn't mean we are going to run out of food,\" Mr Buchanan added. ",

            "content": "Shareholders in the supermarket chain Morrisons have approved a multi-billion pound takeover offer from a US private equity group. Clayton, Dubilier & Rice (CD&R) can now continue to take over the UK's fourth-largest supermarket group. Morrisons said 99.2% of shareholders voted in favour of the £7bn ($9.7bn) deal. The takeover had been the subject of fierce competition from two US-based investment groups. The CD&R private equity group won the auction early in October with an offer of 287p per Morrisons ordinary share, against a rival bid from Fortress, for 286p per share. CD&R's auction offer was slightly higher than the 285p-a-share offer that was recommended by Morrisons' board in August. In July, Morrisons turned down an offer worth £5.5bn from CD&R, saying it significantly undervalued the business. Morrisons hails 'renaissance of the supermarket'\nUS firm wins auction to take over Morrisons\nMorrisons to give workers Boxing Day off The takeover marks a return to the UK grocery sector for Sir Terry Leahy, the former chief executive of Tesco, who is a senior adviser to CD&R. Morrisons chair Andrew Higginson said: \"We thank shareholders for the strong support received at today's meetings. \"We remain confident that CD&R will be a responsible, thoughtful and careful owner of Morrisons and we will now move forward with the remaining steps in the acquisition process.\" There has been speculation that Sir Terry could be appointed as chair of Morrisons. On Tuesday, Sir Terry said: \"We are very pleased to have received the approval of shareholders and are excited at the opportunity that lies ahead. \"The particular heritage, culture and operating model of Morrisons are key features of the company and we will be very mindful of these during our tenure as owners. \"We very much look forward to working with the Morrisons team, not just to preserve the company's many strengths - but to build on these, with innovation, capital and new technology - helping the business realise its full potential and delivering for all of its stakeholders.\" The deal is expected to complete on 27 October. Morrisons has been involved in a legal dispute over equal pay since 2019. Last month Leeds Employment Tribunal found that Morrisons' shop floor workers, who are mostly female, could compare their pay with the supermarket's mostly male warehouse workers. Shop floor staff are hoping to claim up to £100m in missed pay. Law firms Leigh Day and Roscoe Reid have been representing about 2,300 Morrisons workers. Emma Satyamurti, a Leigh Day partner, said the takeover deal shows that employees are the \"backbone of the company and so it makes sense that the supermarket should invest in them\". \"We hope the new owners feel the same and bring an end to the equal pay dispute by paying shop floor workers what they are worth.\" Morrisons was founded in Bradford in 1899 - where it still has its headquarters. The group has almost 500 shops and more than 110,000 staff. The son of founder William Morrison's, the late Sir Ken Morrison, ran the business for 50 years. Previously, CD&R said it recognised Morrisons' \"history and culture, and considers that this strong heritage is core to Morrisons and its approach to grocery retailing\". The private equity firm said it would help Morrisons to build on its strengths, including its close relationships with suppliers and its property portfolio. Morrisons chairman Andrew Higginson and chief operating officer Trevor Strain both previously worked with Sir Terry at Tesco. ",

            "content": "The boss of Spanish energy giant Iberdrola has told the BBC the UK's energy price cap is not working and the country is now paying the price. Ignacio Galan, the chief executive of Iberdrola, which owns Scottish Power, was speaking on the sidelines of a government investment summit. \"The price cap decision was made in a very particular situation, to protect the consumer,\" he told the BBC. \"But when the situation changes, it doesn't work,\" said Mr Galan. \"We are paying the consequences for it now. When you intervene in the market, you can resolve a temporary issue, but you cannot change things in the future. \"The price cap was made on a temporary basis, and I don't know why it has been maintained.\" Why are gas prices so high?\nFirms warn of price rises as energy costs soar\nRegulator warns of significant energy price hikes Mr Galan was attending the government's Global Investment Summit in London, which is aiming to attract more foreign investment in the UK, particularly in green technologies. The energy price cap is designed to protect domestic consumers by limiting how much energy providers can charge them per unit. But with global gas prices soaring, a number of firms have gone bust because the policy is requiring them to charge less for gas than it costs them to buy it. Asked if the price cap was a short-term political decision that has caused long-term damage to the market, Mr Galan replied: \"Yes, exactly.\" 'You have to be very careful. The market has its own rules and if you change something in one place, you never know what is going to happen elsewhere. The world is global and people are affected in different ways.\" Mr Galan said it was not up to UK regulator Ofgem to look at companies' profit margins, adding: \"If there is enough competition, the market will fix the problem.\" He said he thought the current high gas prices were relatively temporary and that any decisions made to deal with the energy crisis should be made for the long term. \"I've been in the industry a long time and from time to time, we face this sort of crisis. The first thing is not to become nervous and to take decisions for a temporary situation,\" he added. \"There is a difficult situation right now, but it will probably disappear in a few months. The reason it's happening is because of a shortage of gas supply, but that's not going to last forever. So we have to be very consistent in our approach.\" Mr Galan called on the UK to be \"much more dynamic\" in moving to a low-carbon future, including speeding up the planning process for approving new power plants. \"Let's have a long-term view, a long-term vision, which I think the UK has, to accelerate the construction of new green power plants and distribution networks to be less dependent on fossil fuels and more dependent on the natural resources the country has.\" Mr Galan's comments came as Iberdrola confirmed plans to invest £6bn in offshore wind farms off the coast of Suffolk, which could create up to 7,000 jobs if the sites receive planning permission. Mr Galan said the UK was an attractive place to invest because of \"stability, predictability, rule of law and a reasonable return on the investment\". ",

            "content": "A brewery in Wales is set to become the first in the UK to be powered by hydrogen, under new plans. Budweiser Brewing Group said the £100m hydrogen project would fuel production, heavy goods vehicles and trucks at its Magor brewery in Monmouthshire. Wales' rural affairs minister said the project had the potential to \"create new jobs and exciting opportunities\". It comes as the UK government said foreign investment deals in low-carbon sectors would create about 30,000 jobs. Prime Minister Boris Johnson is set to announce 18 new deals worth £9.7bn later as he opens a global investment summit. They include investments in sectors such as wind and hydrogen energy, sustainable homes and carbon capture. £117m investment brings brewery jobs to Wales Budweiser Brewing Group's (BBG) project, which is expected to be up and running by 2024, would see the first large-scale hydrogen generation system built at a brewery. It said using hydrogen technology would help to provide zero-carbon power and fuel for all its operations in a bid to become carbon neutral. The firm already powers its brewery operations in Magor with 100% renewable electricity from solar farms and an on-site wind turbine. Mauricio Coindreau, head of sustainability and procurement at BBG, said energy solutions like hydrogen had \"huge potential\" in helping to cut the firm's UK carbon footprint. The group, the UK arm of global brewer Anheuser-Busch InBev, will be working with UK-based hydrogen energy firm Protium, to deliver the plans. Wales' rural affairs minister Lesley Griffiths said the project would be \"important\" towards efforts in tackling climate change. ",

            "content": "Foreign investment deals in low-carbon sectors in the UK to be announced on Tuesday will create about 30,000 jobs, the government has said. Prime Minister Boris Johnson is set to announce 18 new deals worth £9.7bn as he opens a global investment summit. They include investments in sectors such as wind and hydrogen energy, sustainable homes and carbon capture. The prime minister said investors had recognised \"the massive potential in the UK for growth and innovation\". Investments from companies such as Spanish energy firm Iberdrola, logistics firm Prologis and grocery service Getir would power the UK's economic recovery and help to achieve the government's levelling up agenda, he added. Mr Johnson will open the Global Investment Summit in London on Tuesday, bringing together more than 200 business executives. The government has assembled a formidable guest list of the great and good of global business for an investment summit it hopes will alert other international investors to opportunities in the UK. The bosses of the world's biggest investment firm, Blackrock, the biggest bank in the US, JP Morgan, as well as the top brass from energy giants such as EDF will gather at the Science Museum in London. Announcements of nearly £10bn in investment in the UK have been timed to coincide with the event. By far the biggest single investment is from Spanish firm Iberdrola, which owns Scottish Power. Its announcement of a further £6bn in offshore wind investment - on top of £10bn over the last five years - will cement the UK's position as a world leader in offshore wind, just two weeks before the major climate summit in Glasgow. The recent spike in gas prices has brutally exposed UK and EU reliance on fossil fuels, which may also encourage French firm EDF that their plans for a new nuclear plant at Sizewell in Suffolk will get government blessing. The chairman of EDF is due to have a breakfast meeting with the Business Secretary, Kwasi Kwarteng. The government will hope this summit will help reverse a declining trend in foreign investment in new projects since 2015. Later, Mr Johnson will take part in a panel discussion with Microsoft co-founder and philanthropist Bill Gates on the role of private companies in tackling climate change. Iberdrola, which owns Scottish Power, will confirm that it will invest a further £6bn in off-shore wind farms off the coast of Suffolk. The wind turbines in its East Anglia \"hub\" are set to create about 7,000 jobs - although they have yet to secure planning permission. Prologis will commit to invest £1.5bn in the UK over the next three years to develop net zero carbon warehouses across London, the South East and the Midlands, supporting about 14,000 new jobs. \"We believe private sector innovation has, and will continue to play, a major role in overcoming the environmental challenges the world faces today,\" said Prologis chief executive Hamid Moghadam. Meanwhile, Getir plans to put more money into expanding its activities across the UK. The firm uses a fleet of electric vehicles and is aiming to create about 7,000 permanent jobs in 2022. Ultimate Battery Company will also invest £28m in setting up a UK plant for eco-friendly batteries. On Tuesday, the UK government is expected to announce its overall strategy for radically reducing the greenhouse gas emissions generated in across all sectors including industry, agriculture, transport and homes. The government has pledged to reduce emissions sharply by 2035 and to reach net zero by 2050 - meaning the country will absorb as much carbon dioxide (through actions such as tree planting) as it emits. The announcements come just two weeks before the start of the COP26 climate summit in Glasgow - one of the largest world meetings to date on how to tackle global warming. ",

            "header": "UK firms will have to disclose climate impact",
            "content": "Some large UK businesses will have to start disclosing their environmental impact, under new rules set to be brought in by the Treasury. The requirements will also apply to investment products and pension schemes. It comes ahead of November's COP26 meeting in Glasgow, where world leaders will discuss their climate commitments. Experts say the UK, which is hosting the event, is not currently on track to meet its own emissions targets. Boris Johnson has pledged to cut emissions by 78% by 2035, compared with 1990 levels. The Treasury said the new sustainability disclosure requirements (SDR) mean an investment product will now have to set out the environmental impact of the activities it finances. In addition, a company's sustainability claims will have to be justified \"clearly\", and their net zero transition plans properly set out. The aim is to combat \"greenwashing\", where firms make misleading claims about their environmental commitments. Why does a climate summit need 25,000 people?\nScottish climate expert warns 'clock is ticking'\nHow smart appliances can help fix the energy gap But the government said the information will \"only be impactful\" if customers and investors actually use it. Chancellor Rishi Sunak said: \"We want sustainability to be a key component of investment decisions, and our plans will arm investors with the right information to make more environmentally-led decisions.\" He said the rules will \"set new global standards for sustainability that will boost the economy, protect the planet and support our net zero goals\". It is unclear when the rules will come in, or what will happen to firms that do not comply. Details of the specific reporting requirements will only be developed after a public consultation. Mr Sunak first mentioned SDRs in July and has announced these next stages for the requirements in the report: \"Greening Finance: A Roadmap to Sustainable Investing\". Sam Alvis, from the Green Alliance think tank, said it was a \"positive step in greening the private sector\". \"While new green finance is vital, stopping money going into environmentally destructive investments is key. The upcoming spending review is an opportunity for the chancellor to apply the same rules for public spending,\" he added. Rain Newton-Smith, chief economist at the Confederation of British Industry, said greater clarity on environmental impact \"will help investors channel finance into projects that are aligned with net zero targets and will reduce carbon emissions across our economy\". But Heather McKay from E3G, an independent climate change think tank, told the BBC the government would need to send clear signals about \"what is green and what is not\" to ensure companies really change how they operate. She said this would be a \"crucial step\" to tackling greenwashing. Without the right information available, Jessica Fries, chairman of Accounting for Sustainability said that investors and pension funds have made decisions \"in the dark\". \"As a global centre of finance, it will be important that the recommendations align with emerging requirements globally,\" Ms Fries added. Barbara Davidson, of think tank Carbon Tracker, said better enforcement of current accounting requirements was also required to combat greenwashing. \"Without this, investors do not have the requisite information about the effects of climate change for their decision-making,\" she said. Boris Johnson's government is currently on track to cut only about a fifth of UK emissions by 2035, compared with 1990s levels, according to a group of experts that advises the government. ",

            "content": "Goto Energy has become the latest UK energy firm to cease trading amid a sharp rise in wholesale gas prices. The firm supplied gas and electricity to around 22,000 domestic customers who will now be moved to a new supplier. It joins a number of small firms that have gone bust following a global spike in gas prices. Energy regulator Ofgem will now find a new supplier for households, who are asked to do nothing until the transfer takes place in the coming weeks. Goto Energy's collapse takes the number of customers affected by the current wave of UK energy company failures to more than two million. What can I do if my energy supplier goes bust? Ofgem said that the unprecedented increase in global gas prices - which have risen 250% since the start of the year - was putting financial pressure on suppliers. \"Ofgem's number one priority is to protect customers,\" said Neil Lawrence, director of retail at Ofgem. \"I want to reassure affected customers that they do not need to worry: under our safety net we'll make sure your energy supplies continue.\" Mr Lawrence added that if customers have credit, the funds are protected, so customers will not lose the money that is owed to them. \"Goto Energy is now the 16th provider to exit the market since the beginning of 2021,\" said Justina Miltienyte, energy policy expert at Uswitch.com. She said it was important that Goto Energy customers did not do anything until they were moved to a new supplier, as trying to switch providers could create administrative delays in getting their credit balance returned. \"They should make a note of their meter readings now, and again when contacted by their new supplier, to ensure their bills are accurate.\" Last week, Pure Planet, which was backed by oil giant BP, and Colorado Energy joined the growing list of small energy firms that have gone bust recently. Pure Planet said it had been caught between rising costs and the UK's energy price cap, which limits what companies can charge consumers. This had left its business \"unsustainable\", it said. Nine suppliers collapsed in September, but business and energy minister Kwasi Kwarteng ruled out supporting struggling energy firms, although he warned more companies could collapse. The regulator's price cap, which covers 15 million households across England, Wales and Scotland, protects customers on default tariffs by limiting charges including how much customers pay per unit of energy. Why are gas prices so high?\nPM expected to back loans for gas price-hit firms But providers say they cannot pass on rising wholesale gas prices to customers because of the cap. Suppliers that have recently gone bust include Avro Energy, People's Energy and Green Supplier Limited. Rising prices have had reverberations throughout the supply chain. Last week, gas shipping firm CNG wrote to its energy supplier customers saying that it would no longer supply the wholesale market. CNG supplies roughly 46,000 small businesses, including 10-15 small domestic energy suppliers, through its wholesale business. ",

            "content": "Online retail giant Amazon is to offer one-off payments of up to £3,000 in order to attract staff in UK regions where there is high demand for labour. The online retailer is hiring for 20,000 positions across its UK network during the festive season. Fears over worker shortages have already prompted other firms to warn of problems in the run-up to Christmas. Amazon began offering a £1,000 signing-on bonus to recruit permanent staff in some regions in August. As first reported in the Guardian, the company's latest recruitment drive has included a £3,000 bonus for full-time workers at sites such as its Exeter warehouse, while in Peterborough, new temporary and permanent workers are offered a sign-up bonus of £1,500. Pay for the temporary roles starts at a minimum of £10 per hour, rising to £11.10 in some parts of the UK. Toy shops warn of Christmas shortages amid delays\nHow do I find a new job and who is hiring? Over the past few months, the shortage of workers in a range of sectors has led to delivery delays and waste. According to the latest official figures, the number of job vacancies hit 1.1 million between July and September - the highest level since records began in 2001. The largest increase in vacancies was in the retail sector and for motor mechanics, the Office for National Statistics said. Fashion chain Next and supermarket Iceland are among firms warning of potential pre-Christmas disruption because of staff shortages. Some overseas workers have left the UK during the pandemic and also following Brexit. The furlough scheme, which ends this month, has also kept some workers out of the jobs market. Andrew Goodacre, chief executive of the British Independent Retailers Association, said he was \"concerned by the level of wage inflation and bonus payments being instigated by large companies such as Amazon\". Mr Goodacre explained that finding seasonal workers was \"proving difficult\" at the \"most important time of the year\" for many small businesses. \"This kind of action from Amazon will make it harder still for smaller companies who simply cannot afford such wages.\" Mick Rix, national officer for the trade union GMB, said: \"Amazon has been a pandemic profiteer - raking in astronomical sums during the Covid crisis. \"It is only right that they listen to the union representatives of their workforce and ensure that Amazon workers share in the vast profits that the company are making.\" In September, the firm announced it had paid £492m in direct taxation last year as its sales rose 50% to £20.63bn amid a Covid-driven surge in demand. What's in short supply and why?\nAmazon pays £492m in UK tax as sales hit £20.6bn In the past Amazon has faced accusations of poor working conditions both in the UK and the US, where it is the country's second largest employer. Speaking of the new bonuses, one warehouse worker who has worked at an Amazon site for several years told BBC News: \"It wouldn't be the first time the incentives have been offered. \"It leaves workers who have been there for years feeling rather undervalued and underappreciated, as they are training people who are making more money than them, which definitely ticks off the longer term employees.\" In March, the Unite union launched a whistleblowing hotline for Amazon workers in the UK. It also called for Amazon to allow British workers to unionise and to have a greater share of the firm's profits. ",

            "content": "Buy now, pay later firm Klarna is planning changes ahead of an expected Treasury crackdown on the UK market. They include a \"pay now\" option, to let people pay for items in full, immediately. The boom in the use of buy now, pay later has fuelled fears that it encourages people into debt. Klarna's boss, Sebastian Siemiatkowski, told the BBC that retailers using its service see the average value of an order increase by 40%. The company said it wanted to \"drive up standards\" in the sector by improving the way it operates and communicates as well as introducing the choice of paying for items in full, immediately. Klarna said the \"pay now\" option and other changes it was making would give customers more clarity and control. It also said it would perform more thorough checks on how much users could afford to borrow, and use clearer language during the checkout process to ensure customers understood they were taking on debt. The \"pay now\" option for customers is already available in several of the 20 other countries where Klarna operates. Buy Now Pay Later: 'I'm stressed over debt'\nKlarna better than costly credit cards, says boss\nCharities sound alarm over buy-now-pay-later debt Like other buy now, pay later services, Klarna offers shoppers the opportunity of delaying or spreading the cost of a purchase without being charged fees or interest. Instead Klarna charges retailers a small percentage of the transaction cost in exchange for providing the payment service. The opportunity to pay in instalments appeals in particular to younger and low-income shoppers. It allows customers to order several sizes of a clothing item, for example, in the expectation that those which do not fit will have been returned and refunded before they are charged the full amount. But such schemes have been widely criticised for encouraging shoppers to buy more than they can afford, with charities warning it can be a \"slippery slope into debt\". Critics say customers are bombarded with messages urging them to use buy now, pay later credit without a clear enough explanation of what it involves. In particular, buy now, pay later firms have been accused of failing to explain that customers could be referred to debt collectors and that their credit scores could be affected if they miss payments. Consumer group Which? recently found that although Klarna and other firms shared their guidelines with retailers about how their service should be presented, some retailers did not adhere to those guidelines. Klarna is the largest buy now, pay later platform but many other firms offer a similar service, including Clearpay, LayBuy and Paypal. Buy now, pay later services were used by five million people in the UK for total sales of £2.7bn in 2020. However, one in 10 people using them already had debt arrears elsewhere, a review by the Financial Conduct Authority found. The review, led by Chris Woolard, found that three quarters of buy now, pay later users were under the age of 36 and the vast majority of transactions related to clothing purchases. The Citizens Advice charity said it had found shoppers did not view buy now, pay later services as \"proper borrowing\" and many did not understand fully what they were signing up for. The charity warned that four-in-10 of those who had used this type of credit in the previous 12 months were struggling to repay. Klarna's boss said he believed there was a place for this kind of affordable credit offering. \"We firmly believe that most of the time, people should pay with the money they have, but there are certain times where credit makes sense,\" Mr Siemiatkowski said. \"In those cases, our [buy now, pay later] products offer a sustainable and no-cost healthy form of credit - and a much needed alternative to high-cost credit cards.\" Klarna said it had worked with consumer group Fairer Finance to ensure its terms and conditions were \"clear, simple and easy to understand\", and that the language during the checkout process made it \"absolutely clear\" there would be \"consequences for missed payments\". It had also improved its complaints procedure for dissatisfied customers, it said. In February, the government announced that buy now, pay later products would be regulated by the Financial Conduct Authority (FCA). The Treasury's consultation on the sector is expected before the financial watchdog sets out its rules on regulation later. The government said that giving the FCA oversight of firms like Klarna, Clearpay or Laybuy would mean that customers would be able to complain to the Financial Ombudsman if they were not happy with the service.

            "header": "Apparently, it's the next big thing. What is the metaverse?",
            "content": "Facebook has just announced it's going to hire 10,000 people in Europe to develop the \"metaverse\". This is a concept which is being talked up by some as the future of the internet. But what exactly is it? To the outsider, it may look like a souped-up version of Virtual Reality (VR) - but some people think the metaverse could be the future of the internet. In fact, the belief is that it could be to VR what the modern smartphone is to the first clunky mobile phones of the 1980s. Instead of being on a computer, in the metaverse you might use a headset to enter a virtual world connecting all sorts of digital environments. Unlike current VR, which is mostly used for gaming, this virtual world could be used for practically anything - work, play, concerts, cinema trips - or just hanging out. Most people envision that you would have a 3D avatar - a representation of yourself - as you use it. But because it's still just an idea, there's no single agreed definition of the metaverse. Facebook to hire 10,000 in EU to work on metaverse Hype about digital worlds and augmented reality pops up every few years, but usually dies away. However, there is a huge amount of excitement about the metaverse among wealthy investors and big tech firms, and no-one wants to be left behind if it turns out to be the future of the internet. There's also a feeling that for the first time, the technology is nearly there, with advancements in VR gaming and connectivity coming close to what might be needed. Facebook has made building the metaverse one of its big priorities. It's invested heavily in virtual reality through its Oculus headsets, making them cheaper than rivals - perhaps even at a loss, according to some analysts. It's also building VR apps for social hangouts and for the workplace, including ones that interact with the real world. Despite its history of buying up rivals, Facebook claims the metaverse \"won't be built overnight by a single company\" and has promised to collaborate. It has recently invested $50m (£36.3m) in funding non-profit groups to help \"build the metaverse responsibly\". But it thinks the true metaverse idea will take another 10 to 15 years. Mr Sweeney, the head of Epic Games (which makes Fortnite), has long spoken about his metaverse aspirations. Online multiplayer games have had shared interactive worlds going back decades. They are not the metaverse, but have some ideas in common. In recent years Fortnite expanded its product, hosting concerts, brand events, and more inside its own digital world. That impressed many with what was possible - and thrust Mr Sweeney's vision of the metaverse into the spotlight. Other games are getting closer to a metaverse idea, too. Roblox, for example, is a platform for thousands of individual games connected to the larger ecosystem. Meanwhile, Unity, a 3D development platform, is investing in \"digital twins\" - digital copies of the real world - and the graphics company Nvidia is building its \"Omniverse\", which it describes as a platform for connecting 3D virtual worlds. No. Even though there are so many ideas about what the metaverse might be, most visions see social human interaction as the core. Facebook, for example, has been experimenting with a VR meetings app called Workplace, and a social space called Horizons, both of which use their virtual avatar systems. Another VR app, VRChat, is entirely focused around hanging out online and chatting - with no goal or purpose other than exploring environments and meeting people. Other applications may be waiting out there, ready to be discovered. Mr Sweeney recently told the Washington Post that he envisions a world where a car manufacturer trying to advertise a new model is \"going to drop their car into the world in real time and you'll be able to drive it around\". Perhaps when you go online shopping, you'll try on digital clothes first, and then order them to arrive in the real world. VR has come a long way in recent years, with high-end headsets which can trick the human eye into seeing in 3D as the player moves around a virtual world. It has become more mainstream, too - the Oculus Quest 2 VR gaming headset was a popular Christmas gift in 2020. The explosion of interest in NFTs, which may provide a way to reliably track ownership of digital goods, could point to how a virtual economy would work. And more advanced digital worlds will need better, more consistent, and more mobile connectivity - something that might be solved with the rollout of 5G. For now, though, everything is in the early stages. The evolution of the metaverse - if it happens at all - will be fought among tech giants for the next decade, or maybe even longer. ",

            "content": "The government is due to announce its plan for how to reduce the UK's carbon emissions, possibly this coming week. It has already signed up to ambitious targets, attempting to set an example to other countries before November's COP26 meeting of world leaders in Glasgow. The government has pledged to reduce emissions sharply by 2035 and to reach net zero by 2050 - meaning the country will absorb as much carbon dioxide (through things like tree planting) as it emits. But the UK is not yet on track to meet those targets. And as the hosts of the Glasgow meeting, the UK will need to show it is ready to act. As the Queen and Greta Thunberg have both seemingly put it, in different ways - less talking, more doing. So what could be in the government's net zero strategy? It's not just the protestors blocking motorways - just about everyone agrees that tackling the way we heat our homes is a priority. So the government is likely to make clear how it will meet previous manifesto commitments on insulating homes, especially social housing, and promoting the switch to cleaner heating sources. It could set a date for ending the sale of gas boilers. And it could go further. There's a cleaner alternative to gas boilers: heat pumps. They can have comparable running costs to a conventional gas heating system, but the initial installation cost at £6000 and upwards, puts most people off. Is the UK on track to meet its climate targets?\nHeat pumps: What are the alternatives to gas boilers?\nA really simple guide to climate change Nick Mabey at environmental consultancy E3G suggests the government could support firms to supply them with interest-free loans. \"You'd get it in a hire purchase kind of way,\" says Mr Mabey. \"Spread it over the lifetime of the heat pump and people would be saving money.\" The Confederation of British Industry (CBI) representing businesses agrees the government should \"get the ball rolling\" - with the expectation that in the long run heat pumps come down in price and the subsidies can be phased out. Prince Charles has a couple of meat-free days a week. The government could call for more of us to follow suit. They may be reluctant to tell shoppers what to put in their baskets, but according to a survey by the think tank Demos, more than 90% of us would be in favour of a government-led campaign to reduce meat and dairy consumption. A more radical move would be to set higher taxes for meat, or lower taxes on fruit and veg, to influence what we buy. But the government appeared to take that idea off the table earlier this year, saying it would not be putting a tax \"on the great British banger or anything else\". As well as looking at consumer demand, Polly Mackenzie, chief executive of Demos, says the government should use agricultural policy to move away from simply subsidising production. \"We've repatriated control of agricultural subsidies because of Brexit,\" she says. \"We can change what we pay farmers to do, shift that effort and investment into encouraging rewilding, better upland land management, reforestation.\" The switch to electric vehicles (EVs) is underway but there's a roadblock: not enough charging points. You can't easily charge a car from a fifth floor flat and according to the AA around 30% of homeowners don't have access to somewhere to charge at home or at work. MPs have proposed requiring property developers to include public charging points, and said councils should make sure charging infrastructure is built. But low income, remote and rural areas risk being left behind if it's left to the commercial sector to install charging points, says E3G's Nick Mabey. One way to help plug the gap, he says, would be to turn more streetlamps into charging points - something that's being widely trialled already. Charging is slower than at a custom-built charging points, but the installation can be relatively cheap. Above all though the chancellor needs to backs local government financially to make sure charging points are rolled out for all, he says. Nick Mabey's number one priority though is something which sounds more mundane: company reporting. The problem is most company bosses aren't in the job long enough to think past the short term, he argues, and he wants new rules obliging firms to publish their longer term plans to reach net zero. No other country has managed to do this yet. \"It would change the whole face of British business. Investors would fight shy of firms that can't show they're ready,\" he says. \"Firms should be planning for the transition anyway. If they are, they can show investors those plans. If they aren't, why aren't they? And do you want to put your pension in a firm that has its head stuck in the sand?\" Many businesses are supportive says the CBI, but they aren't yet doing it voluntarily. The COP26 global climate summit in Glasgow in November is seen as crucial if climate change is to be brought under control. Almost 200 countries are being asked for their plans to cut emissions, and it could lead to major changes to our everyday lives. Why the COP26 climate summit is important\nSimple guide to climate change\nWhat will climate change look like for you?\nWill the UK meet its climate targets?\nHow extreme weather is linked to climate change The UK already has a sort of tax on carbon because industry has to pay for emissions permits. There are fuel duties too. Economists like the principle: charge people to burn carbon and you give them an incentive not to. So we could raise these taxes further. However, the CBI argues that tax breaks would be more appropriate. These businesses are precisely the ones that need to make huge investments to decarbonise, argues Tom Thackray, programme director for decarbonisation at the CBI. \"There's a case for supporting them not financially penalising them.\" But what about a direct tax on the stuff we buy? In its favour: it doesn't cost the government anything up front and could even raise a bit of revenue. The problem: a carbon tax would make up a bigger proportion of day-to-day spending for society's poorest which seems unfair. Those in favour of carbon taxes say there are ways around this - redistributing the proceeds to people on low incomes for example or using the money to reduce the cost of fruit and vegetables or public transport. The other stumbling block, how to avoid untaxed goods from overseas undercutting tax-paying UK producers, is trickier. But then that is what conferences like COP26 are there for: international cooperation. Rishi Sunak may not be keen on further big outlays after the past 18 months. But, both employers and workers organisations believe it is crucial. The CBI is calling for a \"wall of investment\" from government and the TUC puts a figure on it saying over the next two years £85bn should be spent on everything from faster broadband to reforestation. The CBI's Tom Thackray says \"those costs have to be weighed up against the cost of inaction.\" As well as the impact of severe weather, without investment the UK risks being left behind in the global green tech race, he says. Mika Minio-Paluello from the Trades Union Congress (TUC) says government investment will drive private investment, and the UK could establish some \"international leadership.\" Other G7 nations are already pumping money into helping industries like steel decarbonise, she says. \"If we are ahead of the game, developing technology, that helps future exports. \"If we're late to the game our steel industry is not going to be competitive. For us it's about hitting those climate targets but it's also about future-proofing UK jobs and industries.\" Of course there are dozens more policy options, from building more nuclear generation - which the government is reported to favour - to a frequent flyer levy; supporting carbon capture and storage to restoring peatlands; investing in public transport networks to generating energy from household waste. But whatever the net zero strategy contains, it will be judged not only on its direction and priorities, but also on how concrete its proposals are, so that people and businesses waiting to take action can work out what their next step might be.

            "content": "Recruitment crisis? Boris Johnson says the answer is to pay workers more. That's unusual from a Tory MP, and risks fuelling inflation.\nThere are more imaginative alternative ways of responding to the staff shortages which have put recruits in the driving seat.\nMore pay may not be enough, after work through the pandemic has prompted many to reassess their priorities.\nThe demand for more flexibility is one, allowing more family time, looking after pets or health challenges such as the menopause.\nThere's also the challenge of adapting offices to make them places and spaces to which post-Covid returners would eagerly wish to return. The workplace is a seller's market: 1.2 million job vacancies across the UK in September. That's a record, and it puts employers under pressure to respond. Fending off demands for an easing up of rules that keep out foreign workers, Boris Johnson says that the employer response should be a pay rise. He's got a point. Truck drivers and care workers probably should be paid more, just as gig workers have a strong case for a less precarious income. But higher pay for truck drivers does not deliver higher productivity. It's much more likely to put up the price of delivering stuff. And the Prime Minister is the one who will take flak for a cycle of price inflation as it takes hold, not only from wages, but also from transport fuel, other energy costs, the rising cost of hard-to-source goods, from construction materials to the chip-starved car market. Costs for business and for employers are also going up with the rise in National Insurance Contributions, some of which will also feed through to prices. Plus, government ministers can expect demands from public sector unions to keep up with Jones the Haulier, putting pressure on the Treasury's attempt to keep a lid on public spending. One of the highly unionised parts of the private sector in Scotland, public transport, is currently using its leverage (ahead of the COP 26 summit) to push for higher pay. Wage inflation rewards those with most leverage and clout in pushing for higher wages. It also skews employment towards those with the deepest pockets to pay. Amazon and big supermarkets can pay the upfront bonuses to poach drivers and shop staff from hard-pressed indies. This report, in The Observer, raises the question of whether Amazon is using its deep pockets to buy market share or if it's paying people what they deserve and setting an example for others. However, pay is only one of the ways in which employers can respond. There are other motivations for going out to work, and increasingly, employers will have to be smart about what they provide. Even with the £1,500 signing-on bonus reported for Amazon in its Dunfermline warehouse, there are also reports of very stressful work conditions, driven by data. As for offices, working from home has been unwelcome for some. Young people wanting to get up the career ladder have lacked the opportunity to learn from others, and have had a tough job getting noticed. Those who work by collaboration are missing the spark of creativity from sharing the same space. Some live in unhappy homes, or without enough space, and some are simply lonely in the absence of the stimulus of work and co-workers. So when Scots office workers are allowed to return, such people won't take much persuading. For many others who have learned to enjoy the flexibility and absence of a commute, employers either have to get tough, or they have a job of persuasion on their hands. I get media releases on numerous surveys on this subject, and they converge around the conclusion that many workers are willing to walk out of their jobs if they're forced to return to the office. Some call it 'the Great Resignation', and talk up the potential for workers - having tasted the freedom of flexibility and home-working - to quit and strike out for a better work-life balance, rather than return to the commute and the rat race. How, then, will offices and employment have to change in the post-Covid era? Some companies will downsize their office footprint, and stagger the times and days at which hybrid workers come in. Others are setting days of the week when they expect workers to attend, but if they are all expected on the same days, that is not an opportunity to reduce the office floor space. They still have to plan for high peak attendance. Many of them are busy re-allocating space within offices. Assuming that a lot of the lone screen time for writing, processing and analysing will be at home, visits to the office will be more about meeting, creativity, brainstorming and social time. A challenge there will be the avoidance of too many meetings to justify that facetime in the office. Returners are finding out that another challenge is making hybrid meetings work, where those in the room can be at a marked advantage over those who are not - advantages in getting a message across clearly and without barriers, in building support for an argument from others attending, in reading body language, and in schmoozing before and after. The most imaginative spaces being designed into offices are in the break-out spaces, for people to meet and talk in unstructured smaller groups. Some go for beanbags, some for bar-stools. One Glasgow firm, itison, features a fireman's pole to get from one storey into the kitchen (other forms of descent are also available). That's where the bonds are formed and the ideas are sparked. And if there's anything people have missed about being at work, it is the company, the people and the chat. BBC Scotland got ahead of this 14 years ago, when its new headquarters was ridiculed for having a garden shed to boost programme-makers creativity. The shed has gone (it was never intended for journalists, alas), but the creative spaces were ahead of their time and are becoming standard. Tech companies came along in the past decade, with advanced coffee-making systems as well as the water cooler, plus table football and pool. If Gen Z are expected to do those extra hours, or choose to do so, the firm offers the pretence that they are almost in the bar or at home. Gyms are a priority for some. They can be offered on the premises. A new office block on Glasgow's Bothwell Street offers a running track with a view, high up on its roof. This is nothing new: I recall call centres offering their stressed-out staff a choice of a silent room or somewhere they could go and take out their frustrations on a punchball. Such office extras seem to be becoming more common, a priority for retaining, motivating and de-stressing staff, and a way of building company culture. Last Tuesday, at the official opening of the Barclays campus in Glasgow - designed for 5,000 staff, a doubling of the bank's Scottish workforce, many in technology roles as well as fraud detection - its chief executive, Jes Staley, told me none of the plan is different because of the pandemic experience and time away from office work. He said: \"If you walk around the complex here, and we have five buildings in this area, there's a lot of areas for shops, gatherings, and outdoor space. The idea was to build a certain type of community - one that will help us attract and retain the very best talent.\" Barclays opens major new financial hub in Glasgow A fundamental of the design was for neuro-diversity - working with Autism Scotland to make this a comfortable place for all to work. Some companies are actively embracing the skills of those with autism, as opportunity more than disability. \"There are places where people can gather, very casually and in small groups, places you can be alone if you'd like to,\" Staley said. \"It's a very dynamic workforce. \"It's so different from your traditional walk-in office. It's really based on people having a very flexible approach to how they work. The pandemic, if anything, underscored why this design is going to work so well.\" Among those unsolicited emails I've been receiving, leadership coach Ollie Phillips observes: \"There is merit in allowing people to have the autonomy to work where they want and live the life they want to live, whilst also providing a structure and demonstrating the value of physically being in the workplace as well as creating a compelling, interactive environment where people still want to.\" In other words, make the office environment something people freely choose because they enjoy it, and the company. We also heard last week from Jordan McAffery of HK design consultancy in Edinburgh, where the workforce has pivoted almost entirely to office re-design. He said: \"Staff are craving variety in the workplace. \"Gone are the days of traditional workstations and rows upon rows of desking. During working from home staff have been used to sitting in a lounge area, working on the kitchen table and we're trying to introduce that to workspaces and create that sense of home from home Employers are reluctant to talk about getting people back into the office. Some are privately annoyed that it is still strongly discouraged as a matter of Scottish government guidance. It's not possible to say if the pandemic and working-from-home have led to improved or worsened productivity. Sketchy evidence suggests that some have seen productivity hit, and some have seen it improve. One sector will differ from another. Where firms differ, the poor productivity can sometimes be explained by poor management. But while improving pay and/or the quality of experience when people do - eventually - return, there are other factors that can help employers get the workers they need in a tight labour market, where employees currently have the stronger hand. Extra days off are among them, currently being used as a reward to those who have been through stressful times. Staying closed on December 26 is being chosen by some, while some argue it should be required. A chain of west of Scotland bars is foregoing the bumper takings of New Year's Day to give their workers another day off. Maybe because we've just ended National Work Life Week, my email inbox has not been short of advice. One call is for employers to adapt work flexibly to the menopause. There came a response from CityUK, representing the finance sector, demonstrating precisely the shift in employer embrace of flexibility to retain staff. It said: \"Openly recognising and discussing the impact the menopause can have on women and their careers, and ensuring they have proper support, is the right thing to do both ethically and commercially. It is also essential to mitigating the potential fallout of talent in the workforce.\" There are software solutions to improve 'workflow solutions' in the era of hybrid working. An adviser on work-life balance from Cardiff got in touch to cite survey evidence that suggests only one in five employees would raise concerns about work-life balance with their bosses, but that one in six is ready to leave their job because of stress. Set a good example, he suggests. Listen, through staff surveys. And create a space in time, of perhaps 15 minutes, to zone out of work at the end of the working day, whether at home or in the office. Another email asks if bosses should take responsibility for pets. It's well known that dog ownership has become a more widely shared feature of home life during the pandemic. While away at work, people miss their dogs: their dogs miss people. So anyone for the new differentiating factor in attracting workers: doggy daycare in the workplace, or your pooch by your side through your brainstorming encounter? ",

            "header": "China's growth slowdown suggests recovery is losing steam",
            "content": "China's economy grew 4.9% in the July to September quarter from a year earlier, the slowest pace in a year and worse than analysts had predicted. This was far slower from the previous quarter when growth was almost 8%, suggesting the recovery is weakening. Power shortages, outbreaks of Covid-19 and pressure from Beijing on a number of industries are taking their toll. These developments may dampen growth for the rest of the year and should not be underestimated, one expert said. The world's second-largest economy has faced a number of challenges in recent months. Firstly, when it has come to power supply, soaring global commodity prices have affected the cost of raw materials. This has come at the same time as Beijing has increased the pressure on regional governments to reduce their carbon emissions in line with the country's goal to be carbon neutral by 2060. Many provinces implemented electricity rations, causing blackouts for homes and factories to close. This coincided with the country's largest coal producing province suffering from torrential flooding. The Shanxi region produces about 30% of China's coal. The heavy rains have led the coal price to hit fresh highs and the government to abandon production caps. Why China has been hit by power shortages\nHow China's crackdowns are impacting business The power cuts have disrupted many industries in the country, particularly those that use a large amount of energy, including cement production, steel and aluminium smelting. China's \"factory gate\" prices - a measure of what manufacturers charge wholesalers for products - have felt these effects, growing at the fastest rate since records began 25 years ago. \"The downturn in industry looks set to deepen,\" said Capital Economics' senior China economist Julian Evans-Pritchard, with thermal coal prices still climbing. This has come at the same time as China's property sector has faced increasing pressure to rein in its debt. The most notable example, the China Evergrande Group, owes more than $300bn and finds itself on the brink of default. Another property developer Fantasia defaulted while Sinic Holdings has warned it is at risk of going down the same path, sparking fears of wider problems. \"The slowdown in the property sector will affect the activities of firms in areas such as construction contracting, building materials, and home furnishing,\" said Yue Su from the Economist Intelligence Unit. Despite this, China's central bank has downplayed the risk of contagion over the weekend, breaking its silence on the crisis. Evergrande's \"financial liabilities make up less than one-third of its total liabilities, and the creditors are diverse,\" said Zou Lan, a director at the People's Bank of China. \"Individual financial institutions are not at high risk exposure to Evergrande. Its spillover risks on the financial industry are overall controllable.\" Woei Chen Ho, an economist at United Overseas Bank in Singapore, says the energy crunch and crackdown on the property sector means the bank is likely to downgrade its growth forecast for China for the year. \"The numbers are actually much weaker than what we thought. I think in the fourth quarter it will be even slower because we will see more impact from the energy crunch.\" From big tech to gaming to the education sector, a number of China's biggest companies are facing policy curbs aimed at social transformation. The Chinese government has unveiled a five-year plan indicating that this crackdown will go on for years. While these reforms are aimed at long-term growth, they are currently weighing on domestic consumption and investment, according to Chaoping Zhu from JP Morgan Asset Management. \"Short-term shocks seem inevitable when a variety of policy measures have been introduced in a short period since July,\" he said.

            "header": "How energy flexibility can save us money and cut carbon",
            "content": "Imagine your future home as an energy hub storing electricity from the grid when clean wind power is plentiful, and then selling it back - at a profit - when demand surges elsewhere. For Sussex grandmother Kate Giammatteo, that future is happening right now. She has batteries bolted to the front of her Worthing flat that do just that, and they are forecast to cut her energy bill by £173 a year. And what's good for Kate will be good for the country, because as the UK shifts to electric heating and electric cars to meet its climate goals, the demand for electricity is expected to double by 2050. Already the sector is under pressure to ramp up renewables, because Prime Minister Boris Johnson has mandated that all electricity must come from zero-carbon sources by 2035. Much of the extra energy will be generated by wind power, which is clean and cheap - but - of course - dependent on the wind. That leaves an intermittent hole in supplies. This can be by increasing energy storage using batteries or other technologies - but experts say part of the gap can be filled by enabling consumers to use electricity more flexibly. That's where Kate fits in. The tale of her giant battery offers a glimpse of an energy future in which appliances will use power when it's plentiful, and conserve it when it's scarce. So, you could allow your freezer to turn off for a short time to save power, and your washing machine to switch itself on in the afternoon to use cheap power. Khalid Abdulla, an engineer from Edinburgh, has a hot water tank from a firm called Mixergy that's automatically switched on by his energy supplier's computer when power is cheapest (it can be overruled manually). The tank's insulation ensures the water remains hot whenever Khalid's ready for a shower. In effect, he's storing energy in hot water. It will save Khalid money. And the technology has brought a bonus - the new system has allowed him to dispense with his second water tank, and free up storage for the paraphernalia that accompanies a new baby. But this energy revolution stretches beyond the home, because more and more businesses are being paid by electricity suppliers to use the grid differently. When supplies are plentiful, big refrigeration plants can utilise the power to chill their freezers even harder. Then when there's a surge in demand, they can power down as the freezer temperatures slip back to normal. They are paid in effect for storing energy through cold. Some hotels do the same with their air conditioning. Some asphalt plants are super-heating the asphalt when power is cheap - then allowing the temperature to drop as demand peaks. The COP26 global climate summit in Glasgow in November is seen as crucial if climate change is to be brought under control. Almost 200 countries are being asked for their plans to cut emissions, and it could lead to major changes to our everyday lives. Why the COP26 climate summit is important\nSimple guide to climate change\nWhat will climate change look like for you?\nWill the UK meet its climate targets? Big prices are charged by firms volunteering to turn off their power for a spell when it's needed elsewhere. The steel giant Corus has offered to switch off its supply from time to time for £45,000 per Megawatt. One estimate suggests the value of the flex-elecs market by 2030 will be £2.4bn a year. One firm involved in a UK government trial, Geo, claimed it showed a DSR system could save 49% on utility bills for homes with electrical heating and electric cars. There would be CO2 savings, too. \"They are pretty amazing figures, but they are achievable in the majority of homes as time goes on,\" its CEO, Steve Cunningham, told me. What's more, those savings were achieved using only major contributors such as home heating and hot water. Even more cash would have been saved, he said, if appliances such as freezers and washing machines were fitted with smart plugs so they could also be controlled individually from afar. He said smart thermostats costing £25 could save gas heating by learning how fast a house heats up and cools down, and adjusting boiler use accordingly. \"It's tragic that people who most need tech like this can't afford to access it,\" he said. So how big a role can reducing demand play in smoothing the peaks of electricity use? Sara Walker, reader in energy at Newcastle University, says it needs a big push from policy-makers. She told me: \"There's great potential but there appears little attention on the subject at government level. We really need a strong policy signal - and we're not getting it.\" Follow Roger on Twitter @rharrabin ",

            "content": "The cost to scam victims' wellbeing can be calculated at a monetary total of £9.3bn a year, according to the consumer group Which?. That is the equivalent of £2,509 a year for each victim, but the impact can be higher for someone hit by online fraud. People targeted by fraudsters have spoken of suffering from anxiety and ill-health after being scammed. Which? says the cost to well-being is higher than the typical financial hit of £600. The consumers' association appointed consultants to study data including 17,000 responses to the Office for National Statistics' Crime Survey for England and Wales. The results were then applied to an approach to assessing social impacts approved by the Treasury earlier this year. The model allows researchers to value changes in wellbeing in monetary terms. The research suggested scam victims faced a drop in life satisfaction, significantly higher levels of anxiety, and lower levels of happiness. It was also associated with people self-reporting worse general health, although to a much smaller degree. Jennifer Runham burst into tears in her local bank branch, on her way to the school run, after being told she was a victim of a scam. A cycle of events began when she received an email claiming that she needed to renew her TV licence. She entered her details on what proved to be a fake website, before receiving a call from criminals claiming to be from her bank's fraud department. They had even spoofed her bank's phone number. She transferred £1,500 before realising she had been tricked. \"The impact was massive. I was so upset, scared and anxious,\" said Mrs Runham, who is in her 40s. \"My severe level of anxiety meant I had a lot of help from Victim Support.\" It took a year of battling before her bank reimbursed the money. \"It takes a lot of courage to go through the complaints process. I felt they were blaming me,\" she said. \"I went to the ombudsman. When I got my money back, I felt I had some freedom to get on with my life.\" Charity Age UK has information and advice about TV Licence scams Rocio Concha, Which? director of policy and advocacy, said: \"This brings home the scale of the emotional and psychological harm that victims suffer when they are defrauded.  \"The government must not ignore the huge impact an epidemic of fraud is having on our society.\" She is presenting the findings to MPs on the Draft Online Safety Bill Joint Committee on Monday. Fraudsters steal £4m a day as crime surges\n'We lost nearly £10k to TV licence scammers'\nNew 159 fraud hotline launched to counter threat The draft Bill includes measures to tackle user-generated fraud like romance scams, but omits the scam adverts leading to other types of fraud such as investment scams. The consumer group, alongside campaigners such as Moneysavingexpert's Martin Lewis, are calling for more comprehensive and urgent action regarding online scams. It is calling on the government to include scam adverts in the Online Safety Bill as the first step towards new laws and regulations placing more content policing responsibility on online platforms. Home Secretary Priti Patel has said that the scam provisions in the Online Safety Bill would help fight \"ruthless criminals who defraud millions of people\". ",

            "content": "A former chief technical pilot for Boeing has been charged with deceiving federal regulators who were evaluating the company's 737 Max plane. Mark Forkner, 49, was indicted by a grand jury in Texas of hindering the ability to protect airline passengers and leaving \"pilots in the lurch,\" the US Justice Department said. Two fatal crashes of the 737 Max in 2018 and 2019 killed 346 people. A lawyer for the victims' relatives said Mr Forkner had not acted alone. Prosecutors accused Mr Forkner of \"scheming to defraud Boeing's US‑based airline customers to obtain tens of millions of dollars\" for the company. Following the fatal crashes, investigations found a flaw in an automated flight control system called the Maneuvering Characteristics Augmentation System (MCAS). Boeing says air travel to return to pre-pandemic levels by 2024\nBoeing: Directors to face investor lawsuit over fatal crashes Mr Forkner allegedly provided regulators with \"false, inaccurate, and incomplete information\" about MCAS. Regulators did not publish a key document with any references to MCAS, and so pilot training manuals did not refer to it, and Boeing customers were given incomplete information when buying planes, prosecutors said. The MCAS, a software feature designed to automatically push the airplane's nose down in certain conditions, was linked to two fatal crashes of the 737 Max over a five-month period and led to the Federal Aviation Authority (FAA) grounding the plane for 19 months, an action which was lifted in November 2020. \"In an attempt to save Boeing money, [Mr] Forkner allegedly withheld critical information from regulators,\" said Chad Meacham, acting US attorney for Northern Texas. \"His callous choice to mislead the FAA hampered the agency's ability to protect the flying public and left pilots in the lurch, lacking information about certain 737 Max flight controls.\" Boeing declined to comment. A lawyer for Mr Forkner had not responded to a request for comment at the time of writing. In the two crashes involving the 737 Max 346 people died. In both cases an automated flight control system activated at the wrong time, overriding the actions of the pilots and forcing the aircraft into a dive. It was later revealed that during the development of the aircraft, Mr Forkner sent messages to other Boeing employees claiming that it had been \"designed by clowns, who in turn are supervised by monkeys\". He also boasted of using a \"Jedi mind trick\" to persuade regulators not to impose onerous training requirements on pilots of the new aircraft. If convicted, he could face up to 20 years in prison. But a lawyer representing the relatives of crash victims said Mr Forkner did not act alone, and prosecutors needed to go much further in attempting to find out how far the deception actually went. A lawyer representing victims of a crash involving Boeing's 737 Max in Ethiopia in 2019 described the decision to charge the company's former chief technical pilot with fraud as a \"corporate whitewash\". Robert A. Clifford, founder and senior partner of Clifford Law Offices in Chicago, said: \"The tragic loss of 157 lives could have been prevented had Mark Forkner spoken up but he certainly didn't act alone.\" \"This inexcusable type of corporate greed goes far beyond the chief pilot at the company that haphazardly made these aircraft in an effort to increase profits,\" Mr Clifford said. He said the US Department of Justice should \"go further in its criminal investigation and indictments to determine just how far the deception went and who was at the bottom of it all\". \"I think they will find many corporate officials took part in withholding critical information from the certifying agency. \"A deep-dive criminal investigation is owed to these families who gave the ultimate sacrifice and to the flying public that continues to buy tickets on the Max aircraft,\" he added.

            "header": "Lorry driver shortage: Government to lift rules on foreign haulier deliveries",
            "content": "The rules on the number of deliveries overseas lorry drivers can make in the UK are set to be relaxed in a bid to tackle supply chain problems in the run-up to Christmas. Under the new plans, drivers will be able to make unlimited deliveries or collections within a 14 day period. Currently EU drivers can only make two pick-ups or drop-offs each week. It is hoped the changes will happen by December - but UK drivers fear they might lose work to cheaper EU rivals. The UK's lorry driver shortage - due to a combination of Covid, Brexit and other factors - has affected petrol stations, supermarkets and left containers piled up at Felixstowe Port unable to be moved. Retailers have also warned there could be shortages of items such as toys at Christmas, with shoppers urged to buy gifts early. Why is there an HGV driver shortage?\nToy shops warn of Christmas shortages amid delays\n'We've run out of Harry Potter stock' Last month, the government announced it would grant up to 5,000 temporary visas for HGV drivers from abroad - but so far only a fraction have been issued. And the first foreign drivers brought in on the visa scheme may not even arrive for another month, sources have told BBC transport correspondent Carrie Davies. But now ministers are going further, and plan to make temporary changes to cabotage rules, which govern how many jobs a haulier can make in a foreign country. It means foreign HGV drivers that come into the country laden with goods can pick up and drop off items an unlimited number of times for two weeks before they return home. The changes still need to be approved after a one-week consultation - but if passed they will come into force \"towards the end of this year for up to six months\", according to the government. It would mean thousands more HGV deliveries each month, the government said, so more goods - especially food and items that come via ports - can get delivered on schedule. Transport Secretary Grant Shapps told BBC Breakfast: \"Having some additional capacity right now... it is a good idea. This is a quick way of doing it. It doesn't require visas, it's just a common sense measure. \"It is one of very many things. I don't think it is going to undercut or suppress the market.\" Mr Shapps said problems with supply chains were a global issue. He added: \"It is very tight but our supply chain is pretty robust. They have worked through coronavirus and they will work through this as well.\" But the haulage industry said the measures would undercut British operators. Rod McKenzie, from the Road Haulage Association, told BBC's Today programme: \"Well, I spoke to some of our members last night, and they were appalled. 'Ridiculous', 'pathetic', 'gobsmacked' were some of their more broadcastable comments. \"The government has been talking about a high-wage, high-skill economy, and not pulling the lever marked 'uncontrolled immigration', and to them this is exactly what it looks like. \"Allowing overseas haulage companies and drivers to come over for up to six months on a fortnightly basis to do unlimited work at low rates, undercutting UK hauliers who… are facing an acute driver shortage, rising costs, staff wages. \"So this is about taking work from British operators and drivers and giving it to Europeans who don't pay tax here and pay peanuts to their drivers. \"We don't want cabotage [the transportation of goods in one country by operators from another] to sabotage our industry.\" The Unite union has raised the prospect of possible industrial action in protest at what it sees as poor pay and conditions in the industry. \"The treatment of drivers across the board has been nothing short of a disgrace,\" said Unite general secretary Sharon Graham. \"As the prime minister said recently, the answer to the driver shortage is better wages and improved conditions. This is what we demand. \"Now is the time for action not words. It's time for employers to pay workers a proper rate for the job. \"Unite will be consulting its members before deciding on next steps, including exploring the options for industrial action.\" Mr Shapps said the long-term answer to the supply chain issues \"must be developing a high-skill, high-wage economy here in the UK\". But talking about the latest measures, he said: \"The temporary changes we're consulting on to cabotage rules will also make sure foreign hauliers in the UK can use their time effectively and get more goods moving in the supply chain at a time of high demand.\" According to France's finance minister, the UK is faring worse in the supply chain crisis because it left the single market after Brexit. \"We are facing the same situation,\" said Bruno Le Maire at the G7 meeting in Washington. \"But the fact that we are a member of a very important single market helps us facing these bottlenecks.\" On Thursday, the government said it was also giving hundreds of foreign abattoir workers temporary visas, to help fix the shortage of workers in slaughterhouses. The shortage of staff in abattoirs means pigs are not being killed fast enough, and there is not enough space on farms so farmers are having to kill them themselves. Farmers have already destroyed 6,600 healthy pigs due to a backlog on farms, the National Pig Association said.

            "header": "Shoppers start to use new £100 contactless payment limit",
            "content": "The spending limit on each use of a contactless card has now risen from £45 to £100 - but not every shop will accept the new payment threshold. Retailers say it could take months to update terminals before every shopper can spend up to £100, without the need to enter a four-digit Pin. The move aims to make purchases such as grocery shopping more convenient. But some warn it could lead to a rise in theft and one bank boss questioned whether shoppers want a higher limit. Some 60% of debit and credit card transactions in the UK were contactless in the first seven months of the year. These accounted for a total of 6.6 billion payments with a value of £81bn. The decision to increase the threshold was taken by the Treasury and the City regulator, the Financial Conduct Authority (FCA). Chancellor Rishi Sunak said the decision would bring convenience for shoppers and a boost to the High Street following Covid lockdowns. Listen to the BBC podcast: 5 Minutes On ... Cash - another nail in the coffin? When contactless card payments were introduced in 2007, the transaction limit was set at £10 and designed as an alternative to small change. The limit was raised gradually, to £15 in 2010, to £20 in 2012, and then to £30 in 2015. It was hurriedly increased to £45 last year as the pandemic accelerated a move away from cash. As the limit has increased, so has the frequency of its use. Despite sudden drops of all transactions during national lockdowns, the general trend has been continuing growth. That has come as consumers have been less likely to use banknotes and coins. The huge number of terminals which need to be updated means that Friday marks the first day of a gradual introduction of the new limit. \"It may take days, weeks, or even months for some retailers to make the necessary changes in their systems so that the new limit can take effect,\" said Andrew Cregan, payments policy adviser at the British Retail Consortium. \"Furthermore, some retailers may choose not to adopt the new contactless limit. As a result, customers will need to take care when making payments to check what the maximum contactless limit is for individual stores.\" Rural vacuum for getting hold of cash\nCash access as vital as running water, says Age UK Campaigners have been concerned that as card and digital payments become more prevalent, it could affect access to cash for those who still rely on it. FCA research found that a greater proportion of consumers were finding it difficult to cope with fewer retailers accepting cash during the pandemic. However, it found that eight out of 10 small and medium-sized businesses said they were \"very likely\" to accept cash over the next five years. Graham Farrell, professor of crime science at the University of Leeds, has warned about the \"huge increase\" in attractiveness of bag snatches and pickpocketing by teenage thieves, who could then spend more on a stolen card. He co-authored a paper pointing out that these young criminals could then go on to long-term criminal careers. A thief will now be able to spend more on an unreported stolen card before a Pin is demanded. FCA guidance suggests a cumulative £300 needs to be spent on contactless before a purchase is checked by a Pin, up from the previous recommended level of £130. Prof Farrell told the BBC a halfway house was needed. \"A solution that would balance both sides would be tap-and-Pin. You would have contactless tapping of the card on a machine, without the trouble of putting it in and out of the machine. You would use Pin codes to ensure security, therefore making the theft of the card - as the thieves do not have the Pin - less attractive,\" he said. Authorities have sought to allay any concerns about an increase in fraud, pointing out that there was no rise in the crime after the last increase in the payment limit. Fraudsters steal £4m a day as crime surges \"What's more, we have seen no material increase in fraudulent transactions in other countries where the contactless limit increased to the equivalent of £100 or above,\" a spokesman for the FCA said. Australia and Singapore have contactless limits of the equivalent of about £100, and Canada's is close to £150. Customers of a variety of banks can switch off the contactless function, or request a non-contactless card. Some - notably Lloyds Banking Group and Starling - will allow customers to set their own contactless limit via the banks' apps. Anne Boden, chief executive of Starling Bank, questioned whether consumers really wanted to be able to spend more on Pin-free transactions. \"Analysing our spending data we can see that there appears to be little demand for the increased contactless limit and that many would like to retain the same contactless limit or even reduce it,\" she said. Shoppers can spend more than £100 without a Pin using payment services on smartphones, although they include in-built security on the devices such as fingerprint authorisation. ",

            "content": "Ikea, the Swedish furniture giant, says it expects the disruption to global supply chains to continue for at least another year. Chief executive Jesper Brodin said while there had been some improvement, there was still congestion at ports which has led to supply problems. \"We need to live with disturbances for the year to come,\" he said. The owner of Poundland has also predicted that pressure from supply chain problems will last into 2022. Andy Bond, chief executive of PepCo, which owns Poundland, said that its shipping costs had soared. \"There are some times where we have had to pay 10 times our normal rates,\" he said. \"That's not to say every day but that has been the impact.\" Mr Bond said the retailer had good levels of stock for Christmas and did not expect to increase prices to cope with rising shipping costs. But he said: \"I think that we see the next 12 months remaining challenging.\" Mr Brodin, chief executive of Ingka, which operates the majority of Ikea's stores, told the BBC that the UK and other countries were suffering with \"congestion in ports and disturbances in supply chains\". \"There is no easy fix to any of this even if people are working hard across not only Ikea but also across the world,\" he said. Last month, Ikea said it was struggling to supply 10% of its stock, or around 1,000 product lines including mattresses, to its 22 stores in the UK and Ireland amid the continuing shortage of HGV drivers. Meanwhile, earlier this week, it emerged that the key British commercial port of Felixstowe was suffering from logjams of shipping containers because of the busy Christmas period and a deficit of lorry drivers to shift them. Port delays: 'We've run out of Harry Potter stock'\nWhy even huge ships can't fix the shipping crisis\nIkea struggles to supply 1,000 product lines Ikea has been forced to purchase additional shipping containers and charter vessels to address product shortages. A spokeswoman for Ikea told the BBC last month: \"We have also sent goods by train from China to Europe and we have invested in temporary intermediate warehouses in China, Vietnam, India, Indonesia, and Thailand to support production.\" Mr Brodin said: \"One thing we have learned is it is difficult to predict. You need to be on it every day and find the best solutions. \"At the same time from a realistic point, we need to live with disturbances for the year to come but things will gradually get better, I'm sure.\" On Wednesday, shipping giant Maersk told the BBC it was re-routing some of its biggest ships away from the Port of Felixstowe, due to a logjam of shipping containers. Lars Mikael Jensen, head of global ocean network at Maersk, told BBC Radio 5 Live's Drive programme that some of its largest 20,000-container ships were waiting outside Felixstowe, the UK's biggest container port, for between four to seven days. \"We've taken those measures because we saw, because of the big ships, there is a limit to how many berths they can call in Felixstowe, and because its slower, it took longer to handle every ship,\" he said. \"Instead of wasting time waiting, we progressed to the next stop, and arranged that the boxes are relayed from that port rather than wait for a week and then discharge.\" But on Thursday afternoon, the BBC understands that Maersk apologised to the government for the comments, which led to widespread concern about Felixstowe's capacity to receive and process goods. The BBC has seen details of a conversation between the government and the shipping company. It's understood that Maersk told the government that Lars Mikael Jensen, head of Maersk's east-west network, had said in a press briefing that Felixstowe was experiencing congestion. Mr Jenson had mentioned that one ship was diverted to Rotterdam where the cargo was offloaded to a smaller ship. Maersk said that there is not a specific plan to divert ships from Felixstowe now or in the near future and that traffic is managed dynamically. The company also said they are making decisions for other European ports. Maersk is also understood to have said that they are bringing in 25% more boxes to the UK between July to September, than the same period last year. Ikea revealed that, over the year to 31 August, sales rose by 6.3% to €37.4bn (£31.6bn). Mr Brodin said that when the Covid pandemic first hit last year, the group was forced to speed up a plan to invest in a strategy to meet customer needs and take on \"the new competition\", in particular ramping up its online operation. He said that what the company had planned as a two-year transformation was rolled out in two months. Mr Brodin said dealing with the pandemic \"is definitely a challenging time in so many ways\". He said the increase in annual sales was the one he was \"most proud of\" during his 25 years with the company. \"We have experienced the demand on life at home like never before in every market, since, of course, people have been in the same situation - confined to the four walls of their home.\" ",

On Thursday, 10,000 workers at farm equipment maker John Deere walked out over pay and conditions. Some 60,000 TV and film crew workers are set to strike on Monday, while 24,000 nurses could also protest. It follows a rise in US union activity after decades of decline, as staff demanded better rights in the pandemic. Employers have also found themselves on the back foot amid a labour shortage that has forced them to push up wages for the lowest paid. Thousands of other workers were already on strike in October, including 700 nurses in Massachusetts, 2,000 New York hospital workers and 1,400 Kellogg factory workers in Michigan, Nebraska, Pennsylvania and Tennessee.

The BBC is not responsible for the content of external sites.\nView original tweet on Twitter 10,000 Deere & Company workers based mainly in Iowa and Illinois walked out on Thursday, in what is the largest US strike since 2019. They have rejected a new contract they say insufficiently increases wages and weakens pension rights. Deere said it was determined to reach an agreement that \"put every employee in a better economic position\". In addition, more than 24,000 nurses and other healthcare workers in California and Oregon voted on Monday to allow a strike, after pay negotiations with the private hospital group Kaiser Permanente stalled. Among other things, they want a 4% annual pay rise and longer breaks to tackle pandemic-related burnout. Kasier says it hopes to resolve the matter swiftly. Meanwhile, many US TV and film studios will stop work on Monday as 60,000 film and crew workers go on strike. It would be the biggest labour walkout in Hollywood since World War Two. Their union - the International Alliance of Theatrical Stage Employees - accuses Hollywood giants such as Warner Bros and Netflix of failing to give workers proper breaks. Employees frequently work 12-hour days - often without meal breaks, it says. The Alliance of Motion Picture and Television Producers (which represents the big media firms) says it continues \"to negotiate in good faith\". The BBC is not responsible for the content of external sites.\nView original tweet on Twitter Richard Bensinger, an organiser at Workers United, a union, said the wave of strikes was reminiscent of the 1930s, when industrial action was commonplace in the US. \"Similarly back then the vast divide between the wealthy and the working class became intolerable,\" he told the BBC. \"The decades-long decline of living standards for workers is not sustainable.\" But Gary Burtless of the Brookings Institution is more cautious about the impact of the strikes. \"The proportion of the American workforce that belongs to a union remains very low... The number of work days lost as a result of strikes has remained near historical lows since 2002.\" About a third of all US workers were in a union in the late 1960s, but that has declined over the decades because of anti-union laws and corporate crackdowns on organising. Yet in 2020 the union membership rate edged up for the first time in years to 10.8%. Gallup also estimated 65% of all Americans approved of unions, the highest in over two decades. It's coincided with a swell of industrial action over the last 18 months, as Amazon warehouse staff to New York museum curators sought to unionise for the first time. There have also been months-long strikes by coal miners in Alabama and grocery workers at food giant Mondelez International. They've been buoyed by the tacit support of Joe Biden - who has promised to be the most \"pro-union president you've ever seen\" - and a more left-leaning Democratic party. ",

            "content": "The government is to allow 800 foreign abattoir workers into the UK on temporary visas, after warnings from farmers of mass culls. It previously said businesses should pay higher wages and invest in skills. The shortage of butchers has already seen farmers destroy 6,600 healthy pigs due to a backlog on farms, the National Pig Association (NPA) said. The government also announced plans to allow thousands more HGV deliveries to address a chronic driver shortage. Labour shortage human disaster for pig farms - NFU\nPM not taking pig cull threat seriously, says vet\nAbattoir labour shortage sees farmer kill piglets The meat industry blames the butcher shortage on factors including Covid and Brexit. Thousands of healthy pigs have been culled since last week, when the tally was about 600. Last week, the National Farmer's Union (NFU) warned that pig farmers were \"facing a human disaster\" due to the shortage of butchers. It said that \"empty retail shelves and product shortages are becoming increasingly commonplace and Christmas specialities such as pigs in blankets are already under threat\". The government is temporarily extending its seasonal workers scheme to pork butchers, it said. Up to 800 pork butchers will be eligible to apply until the end of the year for six-month visas. Environment Secretary George Eustice said: \"A unique range of pressures on the pig sector over recent months, such as the impacts of the pandemic and its effect on export markets, have led to the temporary package of measures we are announcing. \"This is the result of close working with industry to understand how we can support them through this challenging time.\" The government added that the temporary visas \"are not a long term solution and businesses must make long term investments in the UK domestic workforce to build a high-wage, high-skill economy, instead of relying on overseas labour\". Alongside the temporary visas, the government announced a package of measures for the industry, including: Animals being slaughtered and processed on a Saturday\nLonger working days in the meat industry, where possible\nA \"private storage aid scheme\" which will allow processors to store slaughtered pigs for three to six months\nSuspending nearly £1m of tax on pig farmers and producers in November It said there had been \"a suspension of approval to export to China for some UK pork establishments\" and that it was working with the Agriculture and Horticulture Development Board to identify other export markets. The extension of visa requirements for butchers follows the announcement of temporary visas for lorry drivers and poultry workers, as the government seeks to limit disruption in the run-up to Christmas. But the first foreign HGV drivers brought in on the new visa scheme may not arrive for another month, sources told BBC transport correspondent Carrie Davies. The visa scheme for HGV drivers to deliver food, opened for applications on Monday. The Home Office has not confirmed the number of visas that have been applied for so far, but several agencies that are recruiting the drivers told the BBC that they were yet to apply for them. A chronic shortage of lorry drivers, which the haulage industry has said is due to factors that include Covid and Brexit, has affected businesses including petrol stations and supermarkets. The government announced on Thursday that it planned to temporarily allow lorries from the EU to make more deliveries, as part of efforts to address the shortage. At the moment, EU lorries can only make two \"cabotage\" trips per week. Cabotage refers to loading or unloading goods in one country when a vehicle is registered in another country. The government wants to relax this rule to temporarily allow EU lorries to make unlimited pick-ups and drop-offs within a two week period. ",

            "content": "The UK's largest poultry seller has warned that the price of chicken is set to rise because of supply chain problems. The chief executive of 2 Sisters Food Group, Ronald Kers, said that \"in reality food is too cheap\". Mr Kers told the BBC that the price of chicken, the UK's most popular meat, should be higher to reflect the extra costs the business is facing. The firm has 600 farms and 16 factories across the UK. Mr Kers told the BBC's Today programme that the company has had to cope with additional costs because of Brexit, Covid, labour shortages and logistics issues. He added that the \"significant\" inflated costs of packaging, energy and CO2 were also \"bulking up the price of food\". Toy shops warn of Christmas shortages amid delays\nWhy is there an HGV driver shortage?\nWhy are gas prices so high? On Wednesday, the founder of 2 Sisters Food Group, Ranjit Boparan, warned that chicken prices would rise by 10%. \"How can it be right that a whole chicken costs less than a pint of beer?\" he said. Mr Boparan said the days of low prices were \"coming to an end\" and that \"transparent, honest pricing\" was needed because of mounting costs. The company has seen its CO2 costs rise by more than 500% in three weeks, while energy costs have increased by more than 450% from a year earlier. It also said feed costs at farms have risen by 15%, with commodity costs in the farming process also up by around 20%. Speaking to the BBC, Mr Kers said: \"If you look at the price of chicken now it is £3.50, while a decade ago it was £5 - it should have gone up. \"People on farms are struggling - we don't have enough people on our factories, farms or enough HGV drivers and as a result we're seeing empty shelves and reduced choice,\" he continued. \"There's no margin in the whole supply chain\". The government's visa scheme for short-term workers meant the company was able to bring in an additional 700 people to secure the volume they needed for Christmas, but Mr Kers said the scheme came \"a little too late and a little too short\". 2 Sisters sells 60% of all turkeys in the country and while Mr Kers said the overall supply chain was \"clearly very fragile\", he advised shoppers to buy \"normally\". The firm produces about a third of all the poultry products consumed in the UK and processes more than 10 million birds each week. Chicken and turkey farmer Rod Adlington, owner of Adlington Ltd, shares Mr Boparan's concerns and has already had to raise the price of his chickens by 8%. \"We've never ever had to put through a price rise before, but if we don't make these changes we just won't be here in six months,\" he told the BBC. The company, based in Coventry, sells premium free range chickens retailing at between £15-£20. It sells about 2,000 chickens a week and 10,000 turkeys each Christmas. The price of chicken feed has gone up by 20%, and the business has also been hit by higher energy bills and CO2 prices. To help deal with the labour shortage, the firm has put up wages by 10-15%. But Mr Adlington says there is still not enough staff. \"The labour issue is catastrophic at the moment, we just have no people for the factories,\" he says. \"There's an awful lot of pressure on us and we just can't take it. We need to find a way out of the labour problems.\" Edward Cayton owns Peck and Yard chicken shop, which has two branches in Manchester and sells 550 kilo of chicken per week. He said prices rises have \"already had a knock-on effect\". The firm, which was Manchester's first Asian chicken shop, has had to pay £4-£4.5 per kilo of chicken breast that would have usually cost £2. Mr Cayton said thigh pieces are also up by a third and wings, which usually cost £2.5 from his supplier, have risen to £3.5 per kilo. \"We can't raise menu prices because no one would pay much more for chicken and I can't reduce staff so the cost is having to come out of our margins\". \"We just have to do more marketing and encourage people to go out to absorb the increases\". One of the key factors affecting the supply chain recently has been the shortage of HGV drivers. The shortage has been blamed on a combination of factors, including the coronavirus pandemic, Brexit and tax changes. At the end of September, the government announced that it would allow 4,700 visas for HGV drivers to deliver food. However, the first foreign HGV food drivers might not be in the country for another month, according to a source with close knowledge of the process. Under the scheme - which is separate to that for HGV fuel drivers - drivers can work in the UK until 28 February. The visa scheme opened for applications on Monday. The Home Office has not confirmed the number of visas that have been applied for so far, but several agencies that are recruiting the drivers told the BBC that they were yet to apply for them. When the visa was announced there was concern from some in the industry that it was too short and would not attract drivers. \"The issue is the shortage of HGV drivers across Europe,\" said one source. \"Offers need to be attractive to encourage drivers to come.\" ",

            "content": "Another UK energy supplier has ceased trading, regulator Ofgem announced on Thursday, making it the third provider to collapse this week. Daligas supplies gas to 9,000 domestic and non-domestic customers. Ofgem said it would find a new supplier. On Wednesday, Pure Planet and Colorado Energy folded, following a sharp rise in wholesale gas prices this year. It comes as big supplier EDF said it was not ready to take on new customers from more failed firms. Since September, 12 energy firms have collapsed which has affected nearly two million customers. Ofgem said it would protect customers and advised them to do nothing until a transfer to a new provider takes place in the coming weeks. Ofgem appoints companies as a \"supplier of last resort\" for people whose energy company has ceased trading. What can I do if my energy supplier goes bust?\nWhy are gas prices so high and what is happening to fuel bills? So far, EDF has taken on 220,000 customers from Utility Point, which went bust a month ago. In January, it was appointed by Ofgem to take over 360,000 households from Green Network Energy. EDF's managing director for customers Philippe Commaret told BBC Radio 4's Today programme on Thursday the company was already working on moving customers from failed company Utility Point. Mr Commaret said it was now a \"big question\" whether the regulator can force firms to take these customers on. EDF has taken on 220,000 customers from Utility Point, which went bust a month ago. In January, it was appointed by Ofgem to take over 360,000 households from Green Network Energy. Mr Commaret said the issue of whether Ofgem can force larger energy firms to step into that role is \"the big question at the moment across the industry\". \"What we are seeing is that the supplier of last resort [process] has worked really well until now and we can be very proud that industry has stepped in in order to help the customers who were in distress,\" he told the BBC's Today programme. \"The question is whether or not we will be able to take that any further and I think that for ourselves our top priority is obviously to maintain the quality of service for customers, not to create any detriment to customers.\" A spokesman for Ofgem said that it can \"direct\" a company to take on customers from a collapsed supplier but that discussions always take place between the regulator and the new firm. Energy firms have blamed the price cap on customers' energy bills for the recent spate of collapses. Wholesale gas prices have risen by as much as 250% since January and spiked in August. Domestic customers in England, Wales and Scotland on a standard - or default - tariff are protected from sharp rises in energy costs by the price cap. Mr Commaret said that \"all the suppliers are suffering at the moment\". Commenting on whether EDF will take on customers from Pure Planet or Colorado, Mr Commaret said: \"As you can imagine, on-boarding tens of thousands of customers is a challenge for the operations. \"I won't apply to be supplier of last resort for any further customers before we have ended with the on-boarding of the Utility Point customers.\" Some of the UK's largest energy companies have been appointed as supplier of last resort to failed firms. British Gas has taken on a combined 441,000 customers from MoneyPlus Energy, PFP Energy and People's Energy. Octopus Energy has stepped in to help Avro Energy's 580,000 customers. E.On is supplier of last resort to a total of 233,000 domestic customers from Igloo, Symbio and Enstroga. Shell Energy is looking after 255,000 customers from Green Supplier Ltd. The government has the power to appoint a special administrator - a quasi-temporary nationalisation - to ensure there are uninterrupted energy supplies to domestic customers. ",

Crypto technologies do not pose a risk to financial stability at the moment, he said. But there are \"very good reasons\" to think that this might not be the case for much longer, Sir Jon said in a speech. A future cryptocurrency collapse could spread through markets, he warned. A severe fall in the value of crypto-assets - for example, to zero - could force investors who have taken on debt with brokers to have to find cash to pay them. \"Similarly, there is the possibility of contagion,\" he said. \"A large fall in crypto valuations could affect investor risk sentiment more broadly, causing investors to sell other assets that are judged to be risky and those perceived to have a similar investor base.\" \"Interconnectedness creates the possibility that shocks are transmitted through the financial system,\" he added. US leads Bitcoin mining as China ban takes effect In the past year, crypto-assets have grown around 200% in value from just under $800bn (£580bn) to $2.3tn (£1.7tn). While this is relatively small in the context of the $250tn global financial system, the 2008 financial crisis was triggered by the sub-prime sector which was valued then at $1.2tn, Sir John said. Most crypto-assets, such as Bitcoin, are not backed up in the real world by assets or commodities. They are essentially strings of computer code, and make up 95% of the $2.3tn. As a result, they are volatile, he said. Connections between cryptocurrencies and the traditional financial system are also growing as big investors, hedge funds and banks become more involved, Sir Jon said. \"Bringing the crypto world effectively within the regulatory perimeter will help ensure that the potentially very large benefits of the application of this technology to finance can flourish in a sustainable way,\" he added.

The fast-food chain has already recruited thousands of workers in the past year or so to keep up with demand. The latest move comes as a nationwide shortage of goods vehicle drivers continues to plague the UK economy. Domino's said it offered good long-term prospects, as more than 90% of store managers had started in the kitchen or as delivery drivers. It also stressed that most of the jobs on offer were permanent and not just for Christmas. However, it may still have a struggle recruiting the workers it needs, according to analysis by job site Indeed. At the start of this month, the share of searches being made for seasonal roles by jobseekers was 27% lower than in the same period in 2019 and down 33% on its 2018 level. In June, Domino's said it was hiring 5,000 cooks and delivery drivers, as staff who joined during the pandemic headed back to former roles after Covid restrictions eased. How do I find a new job and who is hiring?\nWhy is there an HGV driver shortage? Domino's operations director Nicola Frampton said 2021 had been a busy year for the firm so far, but the busiest period was \"just around the corner\". \"Our delivery drivers are vital to the service we provide our customers and the success of our business, so we're really keen to hear from those wanting to join.\" At the same time, Domino's said sales in the 13 weeks to 26 September were up 8.8% on a like-for-like basis to £375.8m. Orders collected from stores rose 40.3% and are now at 82% of pre-pandemic levels.

The company said it sold seven pizzas each second over the 13 weeks, with online orders peaking at 13 a second on 3 July during England's match against Ukraine in the Euro 2020 football tournament. But it also warned that supply chain problems and rising staff wages were starting to have an effect. \"We have seen some impact from the well-publicised pressures on labour availability and food cost inflation, which we expect to extend into next year, but continue to take proactive, preventative measures to ensure our world-class supply chain service levels are maintained and that cost increases are constrained.\" ",

            "content": "Two more UK energy firms have ceased trading amid soaring wholesale energy prices. Pure Planet, which is backed by oil giant BP, and Colorado Energy join a number of small energy firms that have gone bust recently. Pure Planet said it had been caught between rising costs and the UK's energy price cap, which limits what companies can charge consumers. This had left its business \"unsustainable\", it said. Customers of both companies will be moved to new suppliers. What can I do if my energy supplier goes bust?\nEnergy firms' collapse hits 1.5 million customers Pure Planet and Colorado Energy are the latest casualties of a global spike in gas prices. Pure Planet supplies gas and electricity to around 235,000 domestic customers, while Colorado Energy has around 15,000 domestic customers. Energy regulator Ofgem will now find a new supplier for those customers, who are asked to do nothing until the transfer takes place in the coming weeks. The demise of Pure Planet and Colorado Energy takes the number of customers affected by the current wave of energy company collapses across the UK to around two million. Ofgem said on Wednesday that the unprecedented increase in global gas prices in recent weeks was putting financial pressure on suppliers. \"Ofgem's number one priority is to protect customers,\" said Neil Lawrence, director of retail at Ofgem. \"I want to reassure affected customers that they do not need to worry: under our safety net we'll make sure your energy supplies continue.\" Mr Lawrence added that if customers have credit, the funds are protected, so customers will not lose the money that is owed to them. Pure Planet said that the government and Ofgem expect it \"to sell energy at a price much less than it currently costs to buy\". \"This is unsustainable, and therefore, sadly we have had to make the difficult decision to cease trading,\" it said. \"In our case, despite being hedged until next spring, and having had the backing of BP, Pure Planet faced increasing risks and large potential losses by continuing to operate in this market,\" Pure Planet said. \"Sadly, this led to BP taking a decision to withdraw its support and we are no longer able to continue.\" BP said it had worked to support Pure Planet and give financial support through wholesale supply and other funding arrangements. \"However, despite considerable work over an extended period, we concluded it is no longer commercially viable for BP to continue this relationship and took this difficult decision,\" a BP spokesperson said. Nine suppliers collapsed in September, but business and energy minister Kwasi Kwarteng has ruled out supporting struggling energy firms. Last week, he said more companies could collapse. The regulator's price cap, which covers 15 million households across England, Wales and Scotland, protects customers on default tariffs by limiting charges including how much customers pay per unit of energy. But providers say they can't pass on rising wholesale gas prices to customers because of the cap. Suppliers that have recently gone bust include Avro Energy, People's Energy and Green Supplier Limited. Rising prices have had reverberations throughout the supply chain. BBC Newsnight reported on Wednesday evening that gas shipping firm CNG has written to its energy supplier customers saying that it will no longer supply the wholesale market. The BBC is not responsible for the content of external sites.\nView original tweet on Twitter CNG supplies roughly 46,000 small businesses, including 10-15 small domestic energy suppliers, through their wholesale business. Newsnight economics editor Ben Chu tweeted that CNG had recently had to supply gas to households without being paid by suppliers that have failed, including Utility Point and Avro Energy. This has caused a significant amount of financial damage to CNG, Mr Chu said. CNG leaving the market will put further pressure on small UK energy firms and could speed up their collapse, he added.

            "header": "Coronavirus: Unions call for improved vaccine rollout",
            "content": "A global coalition of more than 350 trade unions is renewing calls for politicians to waive the patents on Covid vaccines. They say that failing to do so would compound supply chain crises and inflict \"economic self-harm\". It comes as the World Trade Organization (WTO) tries to broker a compromise at a meeting in Geneva. Critics argue that accelerating the rollout of vaccines is more complex than just the waiving of patents. The dilemma being discussed at the WTO meeting centres on finding the best way to ensure the most widespread and equitable way of vaccinating the whole world from coronavirus and ending the pandemic. Successfully doing so would allow the removal of restrictions that have impaired economic growth. Last week, the International Monetary Fund (IMF) warned that there could be a $5.3tn (£3.9tn) cost to the global economy over the next five years, if the world fails to close the massive gap in vaccination rates between advanced economies and poorer nations. Covid vaccines: How fast is worldwide progress?\nCould lifting patents mean Covid vaccines for all?\nIMF: Vaccine divide could widen wealth gap India and South Africa's governments have led calls from developing economies to relax the rules governing intellectual property of vaccines and other tools used to tackle the pandemic, such as testing equipment. They believe doing so would accelerate vaccine rollout. The UK, Germany, Switzerland, and the European Union are amongst those who are opposed to a waiver. The coalition of trade unions is being led by the International Transport Workers' Federation (ITF). \"These politicians seem hell bent on socio-economic self-harm to further line the pockets of Pfizer, Moderna and BioNTech billionaires,\" says the ITWF's general secretary Stephen Cotton. \"It is utter madness - these leaders are holding the recovery of the rest of the world to ransom.\" The coalition is concerned that many of the 11 million workers they represent across 113 countries don't have sufficient access to vaccines. They warn that the global transport system faces the imminent threat of collapse if not enough workers are vaccinated. \"The inequality in access to vaccines and treatments globally is an existential threat to transport workers' personal safety, but also to the resilience of supply chains, and reinvigoration of the global economy,\" Mr Cotton says. One reason supply chains are vulnerable is that only 31% of the world's 1.4 million seafarers have been vaccinated. They play a crucial role in global trade, given that 90% of goods are carried by sea. Without vaccinations, they continue to struggle with restrictions. This means that more than 100,000 cargo vessel staff remain at sea beyond the duration of their contracts. An estimated 14,000 people have been stuck for over 11 months, according to the Global Maritime Forum. Developing economies such as the Philippines, Indonesia, India and Ukraine are some of the biggest contributors to the global population of seafarers. Their relatively low levels of vaccine rollout explain why the group would particularly benefit from a waiver of intellectual property rules. However, pharmaceutical giants contend that accelerating the rollout is not as simple as waiving those rules. Beyond the formula to make the actual vaccine, expanding production means having skills, knowledge and raw materials. Pfizer, which worked with BioNTech to develop its vaccine, says that because it requires a biological process, vaccine production \"is extraordinarily complex\", requiring 280 different materials or components from 19 different countries. In an open letter earlier this year, Pfizer's chief executive Albert Bourla wrote that the biggest restriction on expanding manufacturing was \"scarcity of highly specialised raw materials\" - something it has been working hard to tackle. The company says it is continuing to ramp up vaccine production. This week rival Moderna's chairman Noubar Afeyan told Associated Press that many requests to share its technology assumed it would struggle to expand capacity, \"but in fact we know we can\". Both companies say they have made considerable efforts to get their vaccines to poorer countries, as well as richer ones. US backs waiver on vaccine patents to boost supply\nWTO head says vaccine makers 'should work with poorer countries'\nHas China made over half of all Covid vaccines? Moderna has spent $2.5bn and 10 years developing the technology behind its vaccine whilst Pfizer spent $2bn before it knew it would be successful. It's this kind of investment that the European Union believes is encouraged when intellectual property is protected, and is why it has opposed a waiver. A European Commission spokesperson told the BBC: \"Our goal is to find a pragmatic solution to support the widest and fastest distribution of Covid vaccines that the world urgently needs. It is, they say, trying to work with WTO partners \"to enhance access to Covid vaccines and therapeutics\". One solution could be compulsory licensing of private firms' technology, which is when governments force them to share it within certain conditions. The UK government says it is \"playing a leading role in the global effort to create and distribute Covid vaccines\" and \"will carefully review any proposal submitted\" at the WTO. However, any agreement at the WTO requires the agreement of all 164 members and many have yet to reveal which side of the argument they sit on. The US is often influential in Geneva as the world's biggest economy. President Biden's administration supports a waiver and believes negotiations are at a critical juncture but fears that the real compromises it thinks are needed at the meeting won't be reached. A US Trade Representative spokesperson told the BBC: \"The US is doing everything in our power to ensure that everyone, both at home and around the world, has access to vaccines because more vaccinations are how we end this pandemic.\" They added that their efforts at the WTO are just one part of a \"comprehensive effort\" to help the developing world. Trade officials say there are encouraging signs of progress from the talks but that time is running out to reach an agreement, ahead of the WTO's ministerial conference at the end of November. ",

            "content": "The end of Covid-19 restrictions in August kick-started Scotland's economic recovery, a new report has found. The Scottish Chambers of Commerce (SCC) quarterly economic indicator report found an increase in confidence across all sectors in the third quarter of this year. However, it also found businesses were still worried about inflation, tax and the energy crisis driving up costs. Tim Allan, president of the SCC, said progress was still \"under threat\". He said: \"The survey results indicate that confidence and domestic sales are generally strong across all sectors surveyed, with expectations in line with improving economic forecasts that the Scottish economy should return to pre-pandemic levels in the spring of 2022. \"However, that progress is under significant threat with increasing concern over the emerging energy crisis driving up business costs, inflation and taxation, the cost of raw materials and shipping, all of which are fuelling uncertainty at a time when businesses urgently need confidence and certainty to continue their recovery from the pandemic.\" Scottish firms raise prices 'at sharpest rate for 22 years'\nJob vacancies rise as candidate numbers 'plummet'\nCovid testing rules 'could destroy' tourism season According to the report, businesses are also worried about labour shortages, with all sectors reporting difficulties in recruiting staff during the third quarter. Mr Allan said if Scottish businesses cannot get the staff they need, they risk \"falling dangerously behind\" the curve on recovery and growth. He called on the Scottish and UK governments to \"urgently\" back businesses with a clear economic plan and budgets focused on business recovery. He added: \"It is business which is driving the rapid return to economic growth and governments must stop adding upfront business costs and instead focus on supercharging recovery by creating the right environment for businesses to trade, invest and grow.\" Mairi Spowage, director of the Fraser of Allander Institute which is in partnership with the SCC, said the research signalled \"an important boost in optimism across the Scottish economy\". However, she added the end of furlough and the universal credit £20-a-week uplift could have a negative impact on top of emerging labour shortages. Last month an HGV driver shortage led to problems for various industries from supermarkets to fast food chains. Many petrol stations also ran out of fuel which prompted widespread panic buying. The UK government introduced temporary working visas to tackle the problem, but Scottish External Affairs Secretary Angus Robertson said the measure would not help all UK sectors. Ms Spowage said: \"It is unknown how many of the workers who were on furlough at the end of September will become unemployed or unable to secure the type and level of work they want. \"This uncertainty coincides with the cancellation of the universal credit uplift which will bring additional financial hardship to around half-a-million families in Scotland. \"As well as the risk of joblessness, labour shortages are becoming clear in many sectors, threatening goods shortages and adding to wider inflationary risks.\" ",

            "content": "One of biggest US ports will start operating 24 hours a day to try to clear long queues of cargo ships stuck waiting outside. It comes as officials scramble to ease global supply issues that may lead to goods shortages this Christmas. The Port of Los Angeles in California will handle more goods at night after a similar move by nearby Long Beach port. The ports - which handle 40% of all cargo containers entering the US - have faced months of problems. Major US firms such as Walmart and FedEx have also committed to increasing their round-the-clock operations to help clear the jam, the White House said on Wednesday. Global supply chains have been disrupted as economies have unlocked and consumer demand has roared back. As retailers rushed to restock their inventories, the shipping system struggled to keep up. Covid shutdowns at major ports and factories in Asia have added to the problem. It has led to shortages of children's toys, timber, new clothes and pet food in the US and elsewhere, while also pushing up consumer prices. TUK toy shops warn of Christmas shortages amid delays\nRecord backlog of cargo ships at California ports The ports of LA and Long Beach - which are the main seaborne gateway to the US - have been hit hard. LA had to move 30% more shipping containers than usual in August, while Long Beach moved an extra 23%. On one day in September, a record 73 ships were forced to queue outside for a berth. Before Covid, it was unusual for more than one to have to wait at a time. Earlier this year, the Biden administration set up a Supply Chains Task Force and appointed a Port Envoy to find remedies for the disruption. Both the ports of LA and Long Beach will now offer more new off-peak night-time shifts and weekend hours, so they can unload cargo faster. On Wednesday, Walmart, UPS, FedEx, Samsung, The Home Depot and Target agreed to boost their night time operations at the port - something that should help clear 3,500 extra containers a week. The Biden administration hopes the plan will also unlock capacity in the rest of the supply chain, including US highways, railways and warehouses. US President Joe Biden, who met retail bosses and union chiefs on Wednesday, said he planned the biggest investment in America's ports in history as part of the $1tn (£730bn) infrastructure bill which is yet to pass the Senate. \"Our goal is not only to get through this immediate bottleneck, but to address the long standing weaknesses in our transportation supply chain that this pandemic has exposed,\" he told reporters. He added that he wanted to make it easier for US firms to make products on home soil. \"Never again should we have to rely too heavily on one company or one country or one person in the world, particularly countries don't share our values,\" said Mr Biden. Unfortunately, it may do. \"There will be things that people can't get,\" a senior White House official told Reuters. \"At the same time, a lot of these goods are hopefully substitutable by other things.\" He added: \"I don't think there's any real reason to be panicked, but we all feel the frustration and there's a certain need for patience to help get through a relatively short period of time.\" Supply chain-related shortages of goods like semiconductors and cars have already driven up consumer prices. The Federal Reserve last month predicted inflation - the rate at which prices rise - would run at 4.2% in 2021, well above its 2% target. The International Monetary Fund has also slashed its growth outlook for the US economy because of the problems. It appears to be harming the president's approval ratings, as the Republican party capitalises on the chaos. It has dubbed this holiday season as \"Biden Blue Christmas\", and former US president Donald Trump used the phrase at his Iowa rally over the weekend. ",

            "header": "Oxford-Cambridge arc: 'Most people don't know what it is'",
            "content": "The government is proposing to develop an economic zone known as the Oxford to Cambridge arc, which it claims will double the size of the local economy. Supporters say it will bring jobs and growth to the region, but critics think a project of this size is not needed. Plans for a major new road linking the two cities have been scrapped, the original aim of building a million new homes has been dropped, but the East-West rail link is still going ahead. The arc follows a curve on the map that also takes in Milton Keynes, Northampton and Bedford and covers an area which has a population of about 3.5 million people. As a public consultation ends with fewer than 6,000 responses, what do people in St Neots in Cambridgeshire, one of the towns in the arc, think of the plans? Lara Davenport-Ray, from the Huntingdonshire Green Party, says she is \"quite disappointed with the consultation\". \"The government has been thinking of the idea of an Oxford-Cambridge arc for over six years and this is first time the public has been asked for feedback,\" she says. She says the questions are \"worded in quite a complex way\" and there is not enough detail in the plans and describes it as a \"top-down idea that's being imposed on the residents who live in the arc\". Ms Davenport-Ray says she has \"little faith that our feedback might be used\". \"There is a need for the government to address housing need, but I'm not convinced the area of land for the arc is where that need is greatest,\" she adds. Philippa Shoobert owns engineering and software firm Smart Control Solutions, which has been in St Neots since 2003. She says the consultation is a \"very long and quite intimidating document\" and is \"the kind of thing you look at and go 'no-one's going to listen to me'\". \"I think it's important, if you are going to develop such a long piece of land, you don't leave us as a housing estate for the big cities at either end,\" she says. \"We're important and, if you want to make people's lives easy and their commutes less, it's important you give us industrial land to use and not for people to have out-of-town shopping. \"You need to have jobs locally. There's no land, they are taking every chunk of land and putting houses on it.\" 'I think this could put our town on the map'\nThe £5bn project that will join university towns\n£3.7m bridge plans scrapped after costs double Ms Shoobert is worried the arc would lead to a \"brain drain\" for places like St Neots, with people taking jobs in the cities in the arc. \"Just because you want to develop this arc doesn't mean it works for everybody,\" she adds. Councillor Stephen Ferguson, the mayor of St Neots, says: \"The town is going through a really positive economic spurt after coronavirus. \"We've had lots of investment in the town, the high street is opening up again and we've the signs of economic prosperity returning.\" The independent town and county councillor says he hopes the Oxford-Cambridge arc will \"bring science and technology jobs into the area which is crucial for a town of our size\". \"But the downside is the massive population growth and the massive house building,\" he adds. Mr Ferguson contributed to the consultation but says the questions were \"obvious things people would be in favour of - economic growth, more houses, more affordable housing\". \"There are no real hard facts of what they are going to do,\" he says. \"I'm worried the Oxford-Cambridge arc and level of development they're proposing is going to detract from our character as a historic town, and the rural nature of surrounding towns and villages, and I don't think building that many houses will help us achieve our zero-carbon goals. \"Most people aren't aware of [the arc] and the regular person in the street doesn't understand what it is.\" The Department for Levelling Up, Housing and Communities says it wants development in the arc to protect and enhance the natural environment. Chris Pincher, the government's Minister for Housing, says about a quarter of the responses to the consultation have been from \"people who have never responded to a consultation before\". \"So we're getting good feedback from a wide variety of people and that will provide really helpful input to the policy propositions that we will generate over the next few months into 2022,\" he says. Two further rounds of consultations are due in the spring when the public will be asked to respond to more detailed options. Find BBC News: East of England on Facebook, Instagram and Twitter.

Fellow supermarket Morrisons said it had \"good levels of supply\". The Petrol Retailers Association (PRA) said there had been an improvement in the situation in London and the South East. However, it said it would \"take some time to rebuild stock levels\" after 10% of forecourts were dry at the weekend. Over the past weeks many forecourts in the UK ran dry as people queued to fill up due to supply chain concerns. An Asda spokesman said on Wednesday that the chain had not had any issues for over a week now. \"There was never a shortage [at refineries],\" he said. \"It was always a case that any increase in demand would be temporary.\" A spokeswoman for Morrisons said the supermarket chain had \"good levels of supply\". Gordon Balmer, PRA executive director, said on Wednesday the situation for independent retailers continued to improve in London and the South East. \"However, it will take some time to rebuild stock levels back to normal running levels,\" he said. Felixstowe port says HGV shortage a factor in container logjam\nHow serious is the shortage of lorry drivers? On Tuesday the PRA, which represents nearly 5,500 of the UK's 8,300 petrol stations, also said that the fuel supply was \"improving\". However, it said that over the weekend the situation had been \"serious\" in London and the South East, which is the most populous part of the UK. One in ten petrol stations in the region were dry at the weekend, which was \"not far behind the rest of the country\" it said. \"There are many reports of wet sites quickly going dry because the continuity of tankers remains out of kilter with orders,\" the PRA said of the region. During the petrol shortages that hit the UK, motorway service stations were prioritised for deliveries. Panic buying of fuel by consumers was sparked after warnings that some petrol stations were having delivery problems. Many parts of the UK economy, including supermarkets, other retailers, and ports, have been dealing with a shortage of lorry drivers. The haulage industry blames this shortage on factors including Covid, Brexit, tax changes, and a slowdown in driver testing. ",

            "content": "A law firm is seeking to launch a group action against Amazon over employee rights for delivery drivers. Leigh Day is claiming drivers hired via third party delivery companies to make deliveries for the online giant should be given rights enjoyed by employees. The drivers are classed as being self-employed, meaning they are not entitled to minimum wage and holiday pay. Amazon said it was committed to ensuring drivers were fairly paid by the delivery companies they work with. Drivers making deliveries on behalf of Amazon for its \"Delivery Service Partners\" are not entitled to National Minimum Wage or an employment contract, Leigh Day said. The law firm says it has already begun legal action on behalf of two drivers and is seeking others to join a group action. Leigh Day, which brought, and won, a landmark case on behalf of Uber drivers for workers' rights in February, claims at least three thousand drivers could potentially be owed more than a hundred million pounds in compensation. It believes that because Amazon tells drivers how they should work, and how they fit into the business, they should have more rights. Amazon pays £492m in UK tax as sales surge to £20.6bn\nAmazon opens first UK non-food store The law firm claims drivers are given estimated timings between deliveries via an app which they have to meet. However, according to Amazon, the routing app provides guidance and it is up to drivers whether to follow the suggested route. Kate Robinson, a Leigh Day employment solicitor, said: \"It appears that Amazon is short-changing drivers making deliveries on their behalf. \"Drivers delivering for Amazon have to work set shifts and book time off, yet Amazon claim they are self-employed.\" She added that that millions of pounds of compensation would be \"a drop in the ocean\" to Amazon. \"For drivers on the other hand, earning at least National Minimum Wage, getting holiday pay and being under a proper employment contract could be life-changing,\" she added. Ms Robinson stressed that it was \"time for Amazon to stop putting profit above people\". Leigh Day is bringing similar claims against Uber, Addison Lee, delivery company Stuart and used vehicle marketplace BCA. The law firm has been pursuing an equal pay claim on behalf of thousands of Asda staff. It is also representing clients from Sainsbury's, Tesco, Morrisons and the Co-op. Amazon capitalised on a surge in demand for online shopping during the Covid pandemic, with sales rising 50% to £20.63bn in 2020. ",

            "content": "Apple's shares dropped on Tuesday following reports it could slash its iPhone 13 production targets due to the ongoing global computer chip shortage. The electronic giant had expected to make 90 million iPhones in the last quarter of 2021, reported Bloomberg. However, Apple was now having to tell its partners that the total will be lower by as many as 10 million units, sources told the business magazine. Apple shares fell 1.2% in after-hours trading on the news. Apple iPhone 13 brings portrait mode for video\nWhy is there a chip shortage? Semiconductor manufacturers Broadcom and Texas Instruments were also down 1%, as sources said they were struggling to deliver enough chips to Apple in time. The BBC has approached Apple, Broadcom and Texas Instruments for comment. In September, Apple launched four new iPhone 13 models: iPhone 13, iPhone 13 mini, iPhone 13 Pro and iPhone 13 Pro Max. Pre-orders started on 17 September and started shipping on 24 September. Millions of products across multiple industries today rely on computer chips to run and semiconductor makers' plants are currently working flat-out to meet demand. Smartphone makers like Apple - some of the biggest chip purchasers in the world - have been severely impacted, but also other sectors like the car industry and the makers of video game consoles. In July, Apple chief executive Tim Cook warned investors that the semiconductor shortage could affect sales of the iPhone and the iPad. Investment firm Wedbush estimates that Apple will be running a shortage of more than five million iPhone 13 units for the holiday season, if consumer demand continues to keep pace with the number of iPhones being shipped for the rest of this year. However, Wedbush analysts Daniel Ives and John Katsingris stressed that the chip shortage was a \"not a worry\" as they expected the smartphones to be available in the early part of 2022. \"Taking a step back, 5 million to 10 million units moving out of the December quarter into the March quarter due to well-understood supply chain issues is not a worry for us and ultimately speaks to a stronger demand trajectory than Wall Street had been anticipating,\" they said. \"We view today's news as nothing more than a speed bump on a multi-year supercycle iPhone 12/13 that continues to play out.\" Their views are shared by several other analysts, who have forecast that the new iPhone 13 models will have a strong sales year as consumers look to upgrade devices for 5G networks.

            "header": "Nations must be 'absolutely vigilant' about inflation, says IMF",
            "content": "The economic recovery has weakened in most rich nations due to the impact of the Delta variant of coronavirus, the International Monetary Fund (IMF) says. It also told the BBC inflation would \"stay elevated\" for the next few months in countries like the UK and US and central banks needed to be vigilant. It cut its 2021 growth forecasts for advanced economies - in particular the US, Japan and Germany - but said most would grow strongly next year. But it said poorer ones may fall back. Separately, the fund voted to keep Kristalina Georgieva as its head after she was engulfed in a data rigging scandal. Ms Georgieva had vehemently denied claims she pressured staff to alter data in favour of China when she was head of the World Bank. The global economy contracted sharply in 2020, but rebounded strongly in the first half of this year as countries unlocked. However, in its latest World Economic Outlook, the IMF said \"momentum had weakened\" since then as the highly transmissible Delta variant of coronavirus stopped \"a full return\" to normality. IMF chief economist Gita Gopinath said one of the biggest problems was high inflation, particularly in the UK and US where it is running at 3.2% and 5.3% respectively. This was partly due to a \"mismatch between demand and supply\", but also in the case of the UK soaring gas prices. She said inflation was likely to stabilise in most placed by mid 2022, although it would take until 2023 in the UK. However, she central banks \"should absolutely be vigilant about what's happening\". Ms Golpinath also blamed the slowdown on continued health risks and supply chain disruption, warning that \"risks to economic prospects have increased\". The IMF cut its projection for global growth in 2021 only marginally to 5.9%, but said it masked large downgrades for some rich countries. Notably it expects the world's largest economy, the US, to grow by only 6% this year, down from the 7% the fund forecast in July .\nIt said Japan and Germany, the third and fourth largest, would expand by 2.4% and 3.1% respectively - down from 2.8% and 3.6%. The UK's economy is forecast to grow by 6.8% this year, down from the previous forecast of 7%. However, the IMF expects most advanced economies to return their pre-pandemic growth trends next year as supply chain issues ease, and to exceed it by about 1% in 2024. By contrast, it said emerging and developing economies (excluding China) could fall back and remain 5.5% below their pre-pandemic forecast by 2024. \"These divergences are a consequence of the 'great vaccine divide' and large disparities in policy support,\" Ms Gopinath said. \"While over 60% of the population in advanced economies are fully vaccinated and some are now receiving booster shots, about 96% of the population in low-income countries remain unvaccinated.\" The hit to these countries' living standards would be \"much higher\" now, she told the BBC. On fiscal policy, the IMF said countries would have to tread fine between controlling inflation and giving their economies enough stimulus to recover. It said that debt in many countries was at record levels due to emergency pandemic spending, and employment remained significantly below pre-pandemic levels. The post lockdown recovery is getting messy. That is the message from the IMF's twice yearly review of the world economy. \"Longer than expected\" supply disruptions are feeding into inflation, and led to downgrades to growth this year for the US and UK. The biggest impact though has been felt in developing economies where a lack of vaccinations, and exposure to rising commodity and food prices has hit prospects. While global inflationary pressures should abate in general in the middle of next year, the IMF groups the UK alongside the US and some emerging economies as places where there are \"upside risks\" from rising prices. The biggest risk is, of course, a resurgence of Covid variants, especially in countries with slow vaccination progress. The UK's vaccine rollout success is singled out in contributing to a rebound in the economy. After a sharper downgrade to 2021 prospects for the US than UK, the PM and chancellor will be able to claim the IMF is predicting Britain has the highest growth in the G7 this year. This should be taken with a pinch of salt. Certainly ground that was lost is being made up, but a bigger fall than any other G7 nation in 2020, because of having suffered the worst pandemic first wave, makes a reopening of the economy appear like a boom. Argentina is growing even more than the UK, but it also lost just under a tenth of the value of its economy last year. But the big picture is now supply problems and price rises. The problem is that it makes central banks, including the Bank of England, more likely to raise interest rates more quickly. Ms Georgieva's future as IMF managing director had been in doubt following a damning report prepared by the law firm WilmerHale for the World Bank's board about data irregularities in the bank's now-cancelled \"Doing Business\" report. It alleged that Ms Georgieva and other senior officials applied \"undue pressure\" on bank staff in 2017 to make changes to boost China's ranking in the report. This was at a time when the bank was seeking Beijing's support for a major capital increase. Ms Georgieva had won the support of France and other European governments last week, but US and Japanese officials pushed for a more thorough review of the allegations, according to reports. On Monday, US Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen said the report raised \"legitimate\" concerns, but \"absent further direct evidence\" there was no basis for a change of leadership at the IMF. Ms Georgieva said: \"This has obviously been a difficult episode for me personally. However, I want to express my unyielding support for the independence and integrity of institutions such as the World Bank and IMF; and my respect for all those committed to protecting the values on which these organisations are founded.\" ",

            "header": "Felixstowe port says HGV shortage a factor in container logjam",
            "content": "The UK's largest commercial port says the supply chain crisis has caused a logjam of shipping containers. The Port of Felixstowe, which handles 36% of the UK's freight container traffic, blamed the busy pre-Christmas period and haulage shortages. However, it said the situation has been improving over the last few days. Shipping giant Maersk told the BBC it is re-routing some of its biggest ships away from the port. The Financial Times first reported on Tuesday that Maersk was re-routing ships away from Felixstowe to other European ports, where smaller vessels will be used for UK deliveries. Lars Mikael Jensen, head of global ocean network at Maersk, told BBC Radio 5 Live's Drive programme that some of its largest 20,000-container ships were waiting outside Felixstowe for between four to seven days. \"We've taken those measures because we saw, because of the big ships, there is a limit to how many berths they can call in Felixstowe, and because its slower, it took longer to handle every ship,\" he said. \"Instead of wasting time waiting, we progressed to the next stop, and arranged that the boxes are relayed from that port rather than wait for a week and then discharge.\" Why is there an HGV driver shortage?\nTemporary visa plan to ease lorry driver shortage\nDriver shortage: 'I got a big pay rise overnight' Problems at Felixstowe come as retailers and other groups warn of mounting concern about stocks in the run-up to Christmas trading. The port has blamed several factors for the build-up of shipping containers, including the busy pre-Christmas peak, haulage shortages, poor vessel scheduling, and the impact of the pandemic. On top of this, there are a high number of empty containers currently sitting at the port. Felixstowe said it is asking shipping lines to remove them as quickly as possible. \"The vast majority of import containers are cleared for collection within minutes of arriving and there are over 1,000 unused haulier bookings most days,\" the port stressed. \"However, the situation is improving and there is more spare space for import containers this week, than at any time since the beginning of July, when supply chain impacts first started to bite.\" Industry bodies estimate there is a shortage of about 100,000 drivers with several sectors from retailers to domestic refuse collection affected. The government recently drafted in military personnel to help deliver fuel and to issue emergency temporary visa to foreign drivers. The shortage has been caused by several factors, including European drivers who went home during the pandemic, Brexit, tax changes and a backlog of HGV driver tests. Tim Morris, head of the Major Ports Group, which represents port operators, said the industry had been had been hit by a whole host of issues, including Brexit border changes, global demand for goods travelling by sea, and the pandemic. \"It has not been easy and there have been times of real stress on the ports system,\" he said. \"Ports have taken significant action to respond to the challenges and build resilience.\" The problem is not just confined to the UK. Ports across the world have also suffered significant delays. Retailers have highlighted particular issues in China and east Asia, where pandemic restrictions and poor weather conditions have affected shipping. Sarah Treseder, chief executive of the trade group UK Chamber of Shipping, said there are reports of dozens of ships forced to wait outside ports in America and Asia. \"We anticipate the disruption will continue while the underlying market volatility stabilises,\" she said.

            "header": "UK job vacancies reach 20-year high",
            "content": "The number of job vacancies in the UK has hit a record high, according to the latest official figures. Vacancies hit 1.1 million between July and September, the Office for National Statistics said, the highest level since records began in 2001. The largest increase in vacancies was in the retail sector and in motor vehicle repair, it said. The UK unemployment rate was estimated at 4.5%, compared with a rate of 4% before the pandemic. The ONS said the number of employees on payrolls showed another monthly increase, rising 207,000 to a record 29.2 million in September. Job vacancies: How do I find a new job and who is hiring? \"The jobs market has continued to recover from the effects of the coronavirus, with the number of employees on payroll in September now well exceeding pre-pandemic levels,\" said Darren Morgan, director of economic statistics at the ONS. \"Vacancies also reached a new one-month record in September, at nearly 1.2 million, with our latest estimates suggesting that all industries have at least as many jobs on offer now as before the onset of Covid-19.\" Chancellor Rishi Sunak said it was \"encouraging\" to see the government's jobs strategy working. \"The number of expected redundancies remained very low in September, there are more employees on payrolls than ever before and the unemployment rate has fallen for eight months in a row.\" Little room for Budget spending, says think tank\nBusinesses welcome back workers as furlough ends However, Yael Selfin, chief economist at KPMG UK, said labour market shortages \"could stunt\" the UK's economic recovery from the pandemic. \"The recovery is testing the capacity of the economy to adjust to a new post-pandemic environment, a task made more difficult by the reduced availability of overseas workers,\" she said. \"Acute skill shortages have pushed vacancies to record levels for a second month in a row in September, as employers struggled to find skilled staff.\" Mark Jenkins, a supply chain director for London-based food wholesaler Brakes, says pressure on the industry is \"extreme\". Staff retention is a problem, he says. \"For every two people we hire, only one person stays, because there are other jobs in the market. \"Wages have gone up by 15% to 20% in some parts of the business in order to attract the right kind of people. And on top of that we're paying retention bonuses to hang on to the staff we do have. \"Everything is making it really difficult for us to service our customers\". Mark says the cost of higher wages will have to be passed on. \"Our suppliers are passing on costs, we're passing some of those costs to our customers, and at the end of the day, the consumers will feel the pain.\" Sectors that had large increases in vacancies included accommodation and food services, professional activities and manufacturing. Hospitality is the sector with the most vacancies per 100 workers. A shortage of lorry drivers, which the industry has blamed on factors including Covid, Brexit and tax changes, has affected fuel supplies in recent weeks and also disrupted food supply chains. The Institute for Employment Studies (IES) said labour shortages were \"affecting the whole economy, and where likely between a quarter and a third is explained by lower migration\". Tony Wilson, director of the IES, said there were now fewer unemployed people per vacancy than at any time in at least 40 years. In particular this is down to fewer older people in work and more young people in education he said. \"These shortages are holding back our economic recovery, and won't fix themselves by just exhorting firms to pay people more.\" The number of people who were economically inactive - those who were not looking for work - fell by 91,000 compared to the previous quarter, but rose by 50,000 compared with last year. It's a good time to be looking for a job. The number of vacancies hit another record high of 1.1 million and average weekly earnings, including bonuses, are 7.2% higher than this time last year. However, these numbers contain a number of Covid-related distortions. The wage numbers are flattered by comparisons to last year when furlough schemes depressed wages and hours worked. If you strip that out wage rises are closer to 4%. That is higher than inflation currently, but the Bank of England expects inflation to rise to at least 4% by the end of the year. That will offset wage rises for those lucky enough to get them. But it will see lower living standards for the many who won't: 5.6 million public sector workers, for example. Higher wages have understandably been welcomed by the government, but there is less evidence of the higher skills that it is hoped will accompany them. And the high number of vacancies suggest that there is now a mismatch between the jobs people want and the ones that are available. Like other sectors, the construction industry is struggling to fill vacancies at the moment. Katy Jordan runs Storey homes, a small house-building company in Bedfordshire. She's having trouble recruiting for certain roles such as site managers, and is having to pay staff more to keep them. \"It's really tough. What we're finding is that it's difficult to employ people on a permanent basis because it's easy for our site staff to have their heads turned by more money elsewhere.\" Katy is having to raise wages to attract people to the company, and keep the people she already has, but she says that's not addressing a shortage of skills and experience in the industry. \"We're paying people what we need to pay them to attract them to come to work for us, because the labour market is so hot at the moment, but what we're not seeing is the productivity of those people adding value to our business on all levels and at all times, and that's what businesses need.\" \"It's great that people can earn more money. We want people to be attracted to the construction industry. But we're not attracting people with the right skills at the moment,\" she says. The record level of vacancies and hiring rates in September \"bode well for the million workers coming off furlough in October\", the Resolution Foundation think tank said, and should \"help limit any increases in unemployment\". The furlough scheme, which saw the government pay towards wages during the Covid pandemic, ended at the end of September with nearly one million workers expected to have been on it. However, a wave of potential job cuts has not happened, early data has suggested. The ONS data showed annual growth in average pay, excluding bonuses, was 6% in the June-to-August period. However, the ONS stressed again this figure has been affected by the impact on lower paid jobs during the pandemic and also by comparisons with last year when more workers were on furlough. The number of people unemployed in the June-to-August period fell by 126,000 to 1.5 million, the ONS said, while the number employed rose 235,000 to 32.4 million. The rise in employment coupled with the strong wage growth \"increases the chances of the Bank of England raising interest rates in the coming months despite other evidence that the economic recovery is spluttering\" said Paul Dales, chief UK economist at Capital Economics. The Bank could become the first major central bank to raise interest rates since the beginning of the pandemic as inflation shoots up. Inflation is expected to rise above 4% by the end of the year, fuelled by rising energy costs. But the Bank is watching to see how many people became unemployed after the end of the furlough programme before making a decision. ",

            "header": "Pensions: Experts say £10,900 a year needed to retire",
            "content": "A single person will need post-tax annual income of £10,900 for a minimum standard of living in retirement, academics have estimated. That spending budget increases to £16,700 for a couple, the calculations for The Pensions and Lifetime Savings Association (PLSA) suggest. For the first time in the assessment, Netflix subscriptions and items such as haircuts are included. The PLSA said lockdowns gave workers a foretaste of retirement needs. \"The pandemic has emphasised the importance of economic security as well as social and cultural participation in retirement,\" said Nigel Peaple, director of policy and advocacy at the PLSA. \"We hope the updated standards will encourage people to think about whether they are saving enough for the retirement lifestyle they want and, in particular, whether they are making the most of the employer contributions on offer in their workplace pension.\" 'Serious questions' face DWP over unpaid pensions\nTriple lock pension pledge suspended for one year The calculations for retirement living standards are pitched at three different levels - minimum, moderate and comfortable - and are developed and maintained independently by the Centre for Research in Social Policy at Loughborough University. The assessment is intended as a guide for those planning their retirement savings. Housing costs are not included on the assumption that most pensioners have paid off mortgages, although the PLSA said that decision would be kept under review. The minimum retirement living standard covers a typical retiree's basic needs plus enough for some social activities, such as a week of holiday in the UK, eating out once a month, but not including running a car. The estimate of an annual budget for the minimum standard has risen since 2019 by £700 for a single person, and by £1,000 for a couple. The total requirement would generally be made up of a full state pension of £9,339 per year, as well as some workplace pension savings. The moderate retirement living standard includes a two-week holiday in Europe and more frequent eating out. This was assessed to require a budget of £20,800 for a single person, £600 higher than two years ago, and £30,600 for a couple, up £1,500. The PLSA said around half of single employees were on track to expect a lifestyle between minimum and moderate. The position would be better for couples who were able to share costs. The annual budget needed for a comfortable retirement living standard has increased since 2019 by £600 to £33,600 for one person and £2,200 to £49,700 for a couple. This covered items such as regular beauty treatments, theatre trips, and annual maintenance and servicing of a burglar alarm. About one in six single employees is projected to have an income between moderate and comfortable. Tom Selby, head of retirement policy at investment firm AJ Bell, said: \"The pandemic has exposed gaping holes in the finances of millions of people, with many having little or nothing saved for an emergency. \"What's more, contribution levels into pension schemes remain low, particularly among self-employed workers. As the UK economy slowly recovers from lockdown, it is vital financial resilience becomes a key focus for policymakers, both in the short and long-term.\" ",

            "header": "PM expected to back loans for gas price-hit firms",
            "content": "Firms hit by a sharp surge in energy prices are expected to get government help worth hundreds of millions of pounds, the BBC understands. Glass, ceramic and paper manufacturers have warned that rising prices may mean they have to charge customers more. On Monday, business Secretary Kwasi Kwarteng submitted a formal proposal asking the Treasury to help such firms. The Department for Business expects the prime minister to back its proposals, which could involve state-backed loans. The government is reluctant to prop up companies which would normally be competitive, which is why support is likely to involve loans rather than grants. The Treasury is said to be still analysing the proposal. Number 10 has declined to comment. Businesses have said they hope for a \"swift response\" on the plans. High energy costs have been forcing manufacturers in energy-intensive industries such as steel and chemical manufacturing to warn of higher prices for their goods as they pass on increases to consumers. Other firms have said they may be forced to shut down their factories if the rising cost of gas and electricity makes it uneconomic for them to produce their goods. Why are gas prices so high?\nIs the UK headed for a gas shortage this winter? Dr Richard Leese, chair of the Energy Intensive Users Group (EIUG) - an umbrella group for several manufacturers including ceramics and paper, told the BBC's Today programme that a quick response from the Treasury to the proposals was \"crucial\". \"We need preventative action to stop the issue spreading further.\" Dr Leese said firms in the sector faced higher tax and levies than European rivals. He said firms had put forward \"practical and sensible\" measures for help, and denied that government help would put any additional burden on taxpayers. Gareth Stace, the director general of the trade body UK Steel, said he had yet to see details of the proposals put forward. He warned that without adequate support, plants could close and jobs could be under threat as high energy costs bite. \"The key test in this proposal is are we now going to be on an equal footing with steelmakers in Germany?,\" Mr Stace said. \"If this package results in us still paying 80% more for energy than our competitors in continental Europe, then really this will really be a flimsy sticking plaster on what is really a major crisis that we are going through at the moment.\" Kendal paper manufacturer James Cropper PLC has been in business since 1845 and is one of the biggest employers in the area. Today, it also makes home insulation and carbon paper, with energy bills working out at about £60,000 every single week. Its chief executive, Phil Wild, told BBC Breakfast: \"Any price increase is significant for a manufacturer like ours that consumes the energy that we do. \"As it happens, we're probably OK here because of some actions we've put in place, but I can see some of those businesses may not make it.\" He added that the recent increase in gas prices had highlighted the need for energy intensive firms to start using more renewable forms of energy, rather than fossil fuels and gas. But in the short-term, paper, glass, steel and ceramics manufacturers \"are really looking to the government for help to get them over that hump\", he said. The proposals by Business Secretary Kwarteng follow days of conversations with leaders from affected industries, as well as a very public row with the Treasury about the status of talks between the government departments. Demands for support from energy-intensive industries have been growing louder, but not all companies are affected in the same way. Some have long-term contracts to buy energy at fixed prices, protecting them from short-term increases, but others do not. Businesses themselves have called for their energy costs to be capped, in the same way that households currently benefit from a price cap imposed by regulator Ofgem. But that would risk simply passing on the extra costs to energy suppliers, says our correspondent. Direct subsidies would add to the burden on taxpayers, at a time when Chancellor Rishi Sunak is expected to seek to curb public spending in his next Budget on 27 October. There are many reasons, both in the UK and around the world. There's been a shortage of gas and energy in many countries as they emerged from lockdown and industry reopened. A cold winter in Europe last year also put pressure on supplies and, as a result, less gas is being stored than normal. On top of that, the UK has fewer gas storage facilities than some countries - meaning it buys more on the wholesale market and is exposed to sharp price rises. There's also increased demand from Asia (which also suffered a cold winter) for liquefied natural gas. And there is a suspicion that Russia, a major gas supplier, is restricting output - an accusation it denies - which, following the law of supply and demand, has fuelled price rises. This has helped push up gas prices in the UK, Europe and Asia. Since January, they've risen 250%. And prices have soared 70% since August alone. Read more here ",

            "content": "The number of people in employment in Scotland continued to rise slightly in the past three months, according to official figures. The Office for National Statistics said more than 2,630,000 people aged 16-64 were working between June and August. It followed another slight increase in last month's figures. The latest rate of 74.3% was 0.3 of a percentage point up on the previous quarter but still 1.1 percentage points lower than pre-pandemic levels. Scotland and London are the only parts of the UK where employment remains lower than before the coronavirus pandemic. Across the UK last month, there was an employment rate of 75.3% and the number of job vacancies in hit a 20-year high. The unemployment rate in Scotland remained at 4.4%. 'Going on furlough saved my life'\nUK job vacancies reach 20-year high\nWhat will happen when furlough ends? Employment minister Richard Lochhead said the Scottish government would \"continue to do all we can to support employees and employers\" following the end of the UK government's furlough scheme. He said: \"In 2021/22, we will invest more than £1bn to create jobs and ensure people have the skills needed to meet the economic opportunities of the future. Mr Lochhead added the UK government \"needs to take action on immigration policy\" to help solve the vacancy rate challenges. Scottish Secretary Alister Jack welcomed the latest figures. He said: \"The UK government's priority is getting people back into work - so it is pleasing to see the latest employment figures once again show positive signs of recovery for Scotland with more people returning to employment. \"Our Plan for Jobs is helping people secure well-paid, skilled employment as we build back better from the pandemic, and we will continue to do all we can to see our economy flourish again.\" The furlough, or job retention scheme, came to an end on 30 September. According to research by the Resolution Foundation, almost one million workers were believed to still be on the scheme when it closed. Many forecasters, including the Bank of England, said they would expect a small rise in unemployment after the scheme was scrapped. Yael Selfin, chief economist at KPMG UK, said labour market shortages \"could stunt\" the UK's economic recovery from the pandemic. \"The recovery is testing the capacity of the economy to adjust to a new post-pandemic environment, a task made more difficult by the reduced availability of overseas workers,\" she said. \"Acute skill shortages have pushed vacancies to record levels for a second month in a row in September, as employers struggled to find skilled staff.\" ",

SaxaVord Spaceport is proposed for Unst, Scotland's most northerly inhabited island. It is seen as a good location because of its clear airspace. Skyrora, headquartered in Edinburgh, has agreed a multi-launch deal over the next decade. It hopes to send its 23-metre (75ft) rocket to deliver satellites into orbit from 2022. SaxaVord Spaceport was originally called Shetland Space Centre but has been renamed. Shetland space launch plans submitted\nRocket test first of its kind in UK in 50 years Skyrora chief executive Volodymyr Levykin said: \"We have made no secret of our ambition to be the first company to launch from UK soil so it's really exciting to agree to this multi-launch deal with SaxaVord. \"The UK is a world leader in space technology, and this latest move brings us another crucial step closer to offering a significant space service from our own soil.\" Frank Strang of Saxavord Spaceport described it as an \"exciting development\". Plans for the facility were officially submitted earlier this year. It is claimed it could support hundreds of jobs. ",

            "header": "Uber loses $5.9bn as Asia investment values fall",
            "content": "Ride-hailing and delivery group Uber has made a $5.9bn (£4.7bn) loss, mostly due to its stakes in other companies. The firm said almost all of the loss was a result of the fall in the value of investments in businesses including two Asian ride-hailing giants - China's Didi and South East Asia's Grab. Shares in Didi and Grab have plunged since listing in New York last year. Despite the loss, Uber's boss highlighted its progress in recovering from the impact of the pandemic. \"Our results demonstrate just how much progress we've made navigating out of the pandemic and how the power of our platform is differentiating our business performance,\" chief executive Dara Khosrowshahi said. That came as the company said the number of trips taken had risen 18% for the three months to the end of March, compared to the same period last year. That helped its revenue rise by 136%. On a net basis, Uber's first-quarter loss soared to $5.9bn from $108m a year ago, driven by $5.6bn of drops in the value of stakes in other businesses, primarily Chinese ride-hailing company Didi. However, Uber has enough cash to hold on to those loss-making stakes and wait for a better time to sell them, chief financial officer Nelson Chai said. Its shares ended Wednesday's trading session in New York 4.65% lower. Uber granted licence to operate in London\nUber to list New York City yellow taxis in app In 2016, as it faced tough competition in China, Uber sold its business in the world's second largest economy to Didi in exchange for an 18% stake in the Beijing-headquartered firm. Didi's US market valuation has fallen by more than 80% since its $4.4bn debut on the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE) last summer. Within days of the listing China's internet regulator ordered online stores not to offer Didi's app, saying it illegally collected users' personal data. In December, the company announced plans to take its shares off the NYSE and move its listing to Hong Kong. This week, Didi revealed that it faced an investigation by the US stock market watchdog about its initial public offering (IPO). In 2018, when both firms were still privately owned, Uber sold its businesses in South East Asia to Grab for a 27.5% stake in the Singapore-based company. Grab's shares fell sharply in their debut on New York's Nasdaq trading platform in December last year. Its stock market valuation has dropped by almost 75% since the IPO, which was the largest ever US listing by a South East Asian firm. Uber also owns a stake in Indian food delivery firm Zomato, which it got in 2020 in exchange for its Uber Eats operations in India. Zomato's shares have almost halved in value since making a stellar stock market debut in July. ",
