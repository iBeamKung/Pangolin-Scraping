They recommend carefully examining information before making an investment decision and to be wary of certain telltale signs, such as an improbable rate of returns, unclear source of returns, returns from persuading others to invest, and claims of being completely risk-free or providing guarantee returns. Other signs to be cautious of are impersonation of famous and credible individuals or companies, lack of verifiable reference sources in securities and financial assets, and requests to deposit investments into a personal account that does not report or notify the investors during transfer.

Chaichan Chareonsuk, president of the Thai National Shippers' Council (TNSC), said Thai outbound shipments are likely to continue growing in the second quarter, albeit at a slower pace than the first quarter when exports expanded by 14.9% year-on-year, fetching the country US$73.6 billion. Mr Chaichan said the export sector faces myriad risks, including the Russia-Ukraine war; rising energy prices; persistently high freight rates, especially to Europe; a shortage of workers in the manufacturing sector and rising wage costs; and raw material shortages and volatile prices, specifically for semiconductors, steel, rare earth minerals, and intermediate and upstream consumer products. The TNSC is maintaining its export growth forecast at 5% this year, slightly higher than the Commerce Ministry's target of 3-4% for 2022.  The ministry reported on April 26 exports remain robust, posting a 30-year high in March, leading the country's outbound shipments to grow by 14.9% year-on-year in the first quarter of 2022. The customs-cleared value of Thai exports in March grew by 19.5% year-on-year to $28.8 billion (922 billion baht), the highest level attained since records began in 1991, with imports increasing 18% to $27.4 billion, resulting in a trade surplus of $1.45 billion.
